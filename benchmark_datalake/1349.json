It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

Since that time I have spent in the European and Central Asian\r\nprovinces, at different periods, nearly two years more; and in the\r\nintervals I have endeavoured to keep in touch with the progress of\r\nevents. My observations thus extend over a period of thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nWhen I began, a few months ago, to prepare for publication the results\r\nof my more recent observations and researches, my intention was to\r\nwrite an entirely new work under the title of \"Russia in the Twentieth\r\nCentury,\" but I soon perceived that it would be impossible to explain\r\nclearly the present state of things without referring constantly to\r\nevents of the past, and that I should be obliged to embody in the new\r\nwork a large portion of the old one. The portion to be embodied grew\r\nrapidly to such proportions that, in the course of a few weeks, I\r\nbegan to ask myself whether it would not be better simply to recast\r\nand complete my old material. With a view to deciding the question I\r\nprepared a list of the principal changes which had taken place during\r\nthe last quarter of a century, and when I had marshalled them in logical\r\norder, I recognised that they were neither so numerous nor so important\r\nas I had supposed. Certainly there had been much progress, but it had\r\nbeen nearly all on the old lines. Everywhere I perceived continuity and\r\nevolution; nowhere could I discover radical changes and new departures.\r\nIn the central and local administration the reactionary policy of the\r\nlatter half of Alexander II.\u0027s reign had been steadily maintained;\r\nthe revolutionary movement had waxed and waned, but its aims were\r\nessentially the same as of old; the Church had remained in its usual\r\nsomnolent condition; a grave agricultural crisis affecting landed\r\nproprietors and peasants had begun, but it was merely a development of\r\na state of things which I had previously described; the manufacturing\r\nindustry had made gigantic strides, but they were all in the direction\r\nwhich the most competent observers had predicted; in foreign policy the\r\nold principles of guiding the natural expansive forces along the lines\r\nof least resistance, seeking to reach warm-water ports, and pegging out\r\nterritorial claims for the future were persistently followed. No doubt\r\nthere were pretty clear indications of more radical changes to come, but\r\nthese changes must belong to the future, and it is merely with the past\r\nand the present that a writer who has no pretensions to being a prophet\r\nhas to deal.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it seemed to me advisable to adopt a middle\r\ncourse. Instead of writing an entirely new work I determined to prepare\r\na much extended and amplified edition of the old one, retaining such\r\ninformation about the past as seemed to me of permanent value, and at\r\nthe same time meeting as far as possible the requirements of those who\r\nwish to know the present condition of the country.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view I have revised, rearranged, and\r\nsupplemented the old material in the light of subsequent events, and\r\nI have added five entirely new chapters--three on the revolutionary\r\nmovement, which has come into prominence since 1877; one on the\r\nindustrial progress, with which the latest phase of the movement is\r\nclosely connected; and one on the main lines of the present situation as\r\nit appears to me at the moment of going to press.\r\n\r\nDuring the many years which I have devoted to the study of Russia, I\r\nhave received unstinted assistance from many different quarters. Of the\r\nfriends who originally facilitated my task, and to whom I expressed my\r\ngratitude in the preface and notes of the early editions, only three\r\nsurvive--Mme. de Novikoff, M. E. I. Yakushkin, and Dr. Asher. To the\r\nnumerous friends who have kindly assisted me in the present edition I\r\nmust express my thanks collectively, but there are two who stand out\r\nfrom the group so prominently that I may be allowed to mention them\r\npersonally: these are Prince Alexander Grigorievitch Stcherbatof, who\r\nsupplied me with voluminous materials regarding the agrarian question\r\ngenerally and the present condition of the peasantry in particular,\r\nand M. Albert Brockhaus, who placed at my disposal the gigantic Russian\r\nEncyclopaedia recently published by his firm (Entsiklopeditcheski\r\nSlovar, Leipzig and St. Petersburg, 1890-1904). This monumental work,\r\nin forty-one volumes, is an inexhaustible storehouse of accurate and\r\nwell-digested information on all subjects connected with the Russian\r\nEmpire, and it has often been of great use to me in matters of detail.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the last chapter of this edition I must claim the\r\nreader\u0027s indulgence, because the meaning of the title, \"the present\r\nsituation,\" changes from day to day, and I cannot foresee what further\r\nchanges may occur before the work reaches the hands of the public.\r\n\r\nLONDON, 22nd May, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTRAVELLING IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nRailways--State Interference--River Communications--Russian \"Grand\r\nTour\"--The Volga--Kazan--Zhigulinskiya Gori--Finns and Tartars--The\r\nDon--Difficulties of Navigation--Discomforts--Rats--Hotels and\r\nTheir Peculiar Customs--Roads--Hibernian Phraseology\r\nExplained--Bridges--Posting--A Tarantass--Requisites for\r\nTravelling--Travelling in Winter--Frostbitten--Disagreeable\r\nEpisodes--Scene at a Post-Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course travelling in Russia is no longer what it was. During the last\r\nhalf century a vast network of railways has been constructed, and one\r\ncan now travel in a comfortable first-class carriage from Berlin to St.\r\nPetersburg or Moscow, and thence to Odessa, Sebastopol, the Lower Volga,\r\nthe Caucasus, Central Asia, or Eastern Siberia. Until the outbreak of\r\nthe war there was a train twice a week, with through carriages, from\r\nMoscow to Port Arthur. And it must be admitted that on the main lines\r\nthe passengers have not much to complain of. The carriages are decidedly\r\nbetter than in England, and in winter they are kept warm by small iron\r\nstoves, assisted by double windows and double doors--a very necessary\r\nprecaution in a land where the thermometer often descends to 30\r\ndegrees below zero. The train never attains, it is true, a high rate\r\nof speed--so at least English and Americans think--but then we must\r\nremember that Russians are rarely in a hurry, and like to have frequent\r\nopportunities of eating and drinking. In Russia time is not money; if\r\nit were, nearly all the subjects of the Tsar would always have a large\r\nstock of ready money on hand, and would often have great difficulty in\r\nspending it. In reality, be it parenthetically remarked, a Russian with\r\na superabundance of ready money is a phenomenon rarely met with in real\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn conveying passengers at the rate of from fifteen to thirty miles an\r\nhour, the railway companies do at least all that they promise; but in\r\none very important respect they do not always strictly fulfil their\r\nengagements. The traveller takes a ticket for a certain town, and on\r\narriving at what he imagines to be his destination, he may find merely a\r\nrailway-station surrounded by fields. On making inquiries, he discovers,\r\nto his disappointment, that the station is by no means identical with\r\nthe town bearing the same name, and that the railway has fallen several\r\nmiles short of fulfilling the bargain, as he understood the terms of\r\nthe contract. Indeed, it might almost be said that as a general rule\r\nrailways in Russia, like camel-drivers in certain Eastern countries,\r\nstudiously avoid the towns. This seems at first a strange fact. It is\r\npossible to conceive that the Bedouin is so enamoured of tent life and\r\nnomadic habits that he shuns a town as he would a man-trap; but surely\r\ncivil engineers and railway contractors have no such dread of brick and\r\nmortar. The true reason, I suspect, is that land within or immediately\r\nbeyond the municipal barrier is relatively dear, and that the\r\nrailways, being completely beyond the invigorating influence of healthy\r\ncompetition, can afford to look upon the comfort and convenience of\r\npassengers as a secondary consideration. Gradually, it is true, this\r\nstate of things is being improved by private initiative. As the railways\r\nrefuse to come to the towns, the towns are extending towards the\r\nrailways, and already some prophets are found bold enough to predict\r\nthat in the course of time those long, new, straggling streets, without\r\nan inhabited hinterland, which at present try so severely the springs of\r\nthe ricketty droshkis, will be properly paved and kept in decent repair.\r\nFor my own part, I confess I am a little sceptical with regard to this\r\nprediction, and I can only use a favourite expression of the Russian\r\npeasants--daï Bog! God grant it may be so!\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to state that in one celebrated instance neither\r\nengineers nor railway contractors were directly to blame. From St.\r\nPetersburg to Moscow the locomotive runs for a distance of 400 miles\r\nalmost as \"the crow\" is supposed to fly, turning neither to the right\r\nhand nor to the left. For twelve weary hours the passenger in the\r\nexpress train looks out on forest and morass, and rarely catches sight\r\nof human habitation. Only once he perceives in the distance what may be\r\ncalled a town; it is Tver which has been thus favoured, not because it\r\nis a place of importance, but simply because it happened to be near\r\nthe bee-line. And why was the railway constructed in this extraordinary\r\nfashion? For the best of all reasons--because the Tsar so ordered it.\r\nWhen the preliminary survey was being made, Nicholas I. learned that the\r\nofficers entrusted with the task--and the Minister of Ways and Roads\r\nin the number--were being influenced more by personal than technical\r\nconsiderations, and he determined to cut the Gordian knot in true\r\nImperial style. When the Minister laid before him the map with the\r\nintention of explaining the proposed route, he took a ruler, drew a\r\nstraight line from the one terminus to the other, and remarked in a tone\r\nthat precluded all discussion, \"You will construct the line so!\" And\r\nthe line was so constructed--remaining to all future ages, like St.\r\nPetersburg and the Pyramids, a magnificent monument of autocratic power.\r\n\r\nFormerly this well-known incident was often cited in whispered\r\nphilippics to illustrate the evils of the autocratic form of government.\r\nImperial whims, it was said, over-ride grave economic considerations.\r\nIn recent years, however, a change seems to have taken place in public\r\nopinion, and some people now assert that this so-called Imperial whim\r\nwas an act of far-seeing policy. As by far the greater part of the goods\r\nand passengers are carried the whole length of the line, it is well that\r\nthe line should be as short as possible, and that branch lines should be\r\nconstructed to the towns lying to the right and left. Evidently there is\r\na good deal to be said in favour of this view.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the railway system there has been another\r\ndisturbing cause, which is not likely to occur to the English mind. In\r\nEngland, individuals and companies habitually act according to their\r\nprivate interests, and the State interferes as little as possible;\r\nprivate initiative does as it pleases, unless the authorities can prove\r\nthat important bad consequences will necessarily result. In Russia, the\r\nonus probandi lies on the other side; private initiative is allowed\r\nto do nothing until it gives guarantees against all possible bad\r\nconsequences. When any great enterprise is projected, the first question\r\nis--\"How will this new scheme affect the interests of the State?\" Thus,\r\nwhen the course of a new railway has to be determined, the military\r\nauthorities are among the first to be consulted, and their opinion has\r\na great influence on the ultimate decision. The natural consequence is\r\nthat the railway-map of Russia presents to the eye of the strategist\r\nmuch that is quite unintelligible to the ordinary observer--a fact that\r\nwill become apparent even to the uninitiated as soon as a war breaks out\r\nin Eastern Europe. Russia is no longer what she was in the days of the\r\nCrimean War, when troops and stores had to be conveyed hundreds of miles\r\nby the most primitive means of transport. At that time she had only\r\n750 miles of railway; now she has over 36,000 miles, and every year new\r\nlines are constructed.\r\n\r\nThe water-communication has likewise in recent years been greatly\r\nimproved. On the principal rivers there are now good steamers.\r\nUnfortunately, the climate puts serious obstructions in the way of\r\nnavigation. For nearly half of the year the rivers are covered with ice,\r\nand during a great part of the open season navigation is difficult. When\r\nthe ice and snow melt the rivers overflow their banks and lay a great\r\npart of the low-lying country under water, so that many villages can\r\nonly be approached in boats; but very soon the flood subsides, and the\r\nwater falls so rapidly that by midsummer the larger steamers have\r\ngreat difficulty in picking their way among the sandbanks. The Neva\r\nalone--that queen of northern rivers--has at all times a plentiful\r\nsupply of water.\r\n\r\nBesides the Neva, the rivers commonly visited by the tourist are the\r\nVolga and the Don, which form part of what may be called the Russian\r\ngrand tour. Englishmen who wish to see something more than St.\r\nPetersburg and Moscow generally go by rail to Nizhni-Novgorod, where\r\nthey visit the great fair, and then get on board one of the Volga\r\nsteamers. For those who have mastered the important fact that Russia\r\nis not a country of fine scenery, the voyage down the river is pleasant\r\nenough. The left bank is as flat as the banks of the Rhine below\r\nCologne, but the right bank is high, occasionally well wooded, and not\r\ndevoid of a certain tame picturesqueness. Early on the second day\r\nthe steamer reaches Kazan, once the capital of an independent Tartar\r\nkhanate, and still containing a considerable Tartar population. Several\r\nmetchets (as the Mahometan houses of prayer are here termed), with their\r\ndiminutive minarets in the lower part of the town, show that Islamism\r\nstill survives, though the khanate was annexed to Muscovy more than\r\nthree centuries ago; but the town, as a whole, has a European rather\r\nthan an Asiatic character. If any one visits it in the hope of getting\r\n\"a glimpse of the East,\" he will be grievously disappointed, unless,\r\nindeed, he happens to be one of those imaginative tourists who always\r\ndiscover what they wish to see. And yet it must be admitted that, of\r\nall the towns on the route, Kazan is the most interesting. Though\r\nnot Oriental, it has a peculiar character of its own, whilst all the\r\nothers--Simbirsk, Samara, Saratof--are as uninteresting as Russian\r\nprovincial towns commonly are. The full force and solemnity of that\r\nexpression will be explained in the sequel.\r\n\r\nProbably about sunrise on the third day something like a range of\r\nmountains will appear on the horizon. It may be well to say at once, to\r\nprevent disappointment, that in reality nothing worthy of the name\r\nof mountain is to be found in that part of the country. The nearest\r\nmountain-range in that direction is the Caucasus, which is hundreds of\r\nmiles distant, and consequently cannot by any possibility be seen from\r\nthe deck of a steamer. The elevations in question are simply a low range\r\nof hills, called the Zhigulinskiya Gori. In Western Europe they would\r\nnot attract much attention, but \"in the kingdom of the blind,\" as the\r\nFrench proverb has it, \"the one-eyed man is king\"; and in a flat region\r\nlike Eastern Russia these hills form a prominent feature. Though they\r\nhave nothing of Alpine grandeur, yet their well-wooded slopes, coming\r\ndown to the water\u0027s edge--especially when covered with the delicate\r\ntints of early spring, or the rich yellow and red of autumnal\r\nfoliage--leave an impression on the memory not easily effaced.\r\n\r\nOn the whole--with all due deference to the opinions of my patriotic\r\nRussian friends--I must say that Volga scenery hardly repays the time,\r\ntrouble and expense which a voyage from Nizhni to Tsaritsin demands.\r\nThere are some pretty bits here and there, but they are \"few and far\r\nbetween.\" A glass of the most exquisite wine diluted with a gallon\r\nof water makes a very insipid beverage. The deck of the steamer is\r\ngenerally much more interesting than the banks of the river. There one\r\nmeets with curious travelling companions. The majority of the passengers\r\nare probably Russian peasants, who are always ready to chat freely\r\nwithout demanding a formal introduction, and to relate--with certain\r\nrestrictions--to a new acquaintance the simple story of their lives.\r\nOften I have thus whiled away the weary hours both pleasantly and\r\nprofitably, and have always been impressed with the peasant\u0027s homely\r\ncommon sense, good-natured kindliness, half-fatalistic resignation,\r\nand strong desire to learn something about foreign countries. This\r\nlast peculiarity makes him question as well as communicate, and his\r\nquestions, though sometimes apparently childish, are generally to the\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAmong the passengers are probably also some representatives of the\r\nvarious Finnish tribes inhabiting this part of the country; they may be\r\ninteresting to the ethnologist who loves to study physiognomy, but they\r\nare far less sociable than the Russians. Nature seems to have made them\r\nsilent and morose, whilst their conditions of life have made them shy\r\nand distrustful. The Tartar, on the other hand, is almost sure to be\r\na lively and amusing companion. Most probably he is a peddler or small\r\ntrader of some kind. The bundle on which he reclines contains his\r\nstock-in-trade, composed, perhaps, of cotton printed goods and\r\nespecially bright-coloured cotton handkerchiefs. He himself is enveloped\r\nin a capacious greasy khalát, or dressing-gown, and wears a fur cap,\r\nthough the thermometer may be at 90 degrees in the shade. The roguish\r\ntwinkle in his small piercing eyes contrasts strongly with the sombre,\r\nstolid expression of the Finnish peasants sitting near him. He has much\r\nto relate about St. Petersburg, Moscow, and perhaps Astrakhan; but, like\r\na genuine trader, he is very reticent regarding the mysteries of his own\r\ncraft. Towards sunset he retires with his companions to some quiet spot\r\non the deck to recite evening prayers. Here all the good Mahometans on\r\nboard assemble and stroke their beards, kneel on their little strips\r\nof carpet and prostrate themselves, all keeping time as if they\r\nwere performing some new kind of drill under the eve of a severe\r\ndrill-sergeant.\r\n\r\nIf the voyage is made about the end of September, when the traders are\r\nreturning home from the fair at Nizhni-Novgorod, the ethnologist will\r\nhave a still better opportunity of study. He will then find not only\r\nrepresentatives of the Finnish and Tartar races, but also Armenians,\r\nCircassians, Persians, Bokhariots, and other Orientals--a motley and\r\npicturesque but decidedly unsavoury cargo.\r\n\r\nHowever great the ethnographical variety on board may be, the traveller\r\nwill probably find that four days on the Volga are quite enough for all\r\npractical and aesthetic purposes, and instead of going on to Astrakhan\r\nhe will quit the steamer at Tsaritsin. Here he will find a railway of\r\nabout fifty miles in length, connecting the Volga and the Don. I say\r\nadvisedly a railway, and not a train, because trains on this line are\r\nnot very frequent. When I first visited the locality, thirty years ago,\r\nthere were only two a week, so that if you inadvertently missed one\r\ntrain you had to wait about three days for the next. Prudent, nervous\r\npeople preferred travelling by the road, for on the railway the strange\r\njolts and mysterious creakings were very alarming. On the other hand the\r\npace was so slow that running off the rails would have been merely an\r\namusing episode, and even a collision could scarcely have been attended\r\nwith serious consequences. Happily things are improving, even in this\r\noutlying part of the country. Now there is one train daily, and it goes\r\nat a less funereal pace.\r\n\r\nFrom Kalatch, at the Don end of the line, a steamer starts for Rostoff,\r\nwhich is situated near the mouth of the river. The navigation of the Don\r\nis much more difficult than that of the Volga. The river is extremely\r\nshallow, and the sand-banks are continually shifting, so that many times\r\nin the course of the day the steamer runs aground. Sometimes she is got\r\noff by simply reversing the engines, but not unfrequently she sticks so\r\nfast that the engines have to be assisted. This is effected in a curious\r\nway. The captain always gives a number of stalwart Cossacks a free\r\npassage on condition that they will give him the assistance he requires;\r\nand as soon as the ship sticks fast he orders them to jump overboard\r\nwith a stout hawser and haul her off! The task is not a pleasant one,\r\nespecially as the poor fellows cannot afterwards change their clothes;\r\nbut the order is always obeyed with alacrity and without grumbling.\r\nCossacks, it would seem, have no personal acquaintance with colds and\r\nrheumatism.\r\n\r\nIn the most approved manuals of geography the Don figures as one of the\r\nprincipal European rivers, and its length and breadth give it a right to\r\nbe considered as such; but its depth in many parts is ludicrously out\r\nof proportion to its length and breadth. I remember one day seeing\r\nthe captain of a large, flat-bottomed steamer slacken speed, to avoid\r\nrunning down a man on horseback who was attempting to cross his bows in\r\nthe middle of the stream. Another day a not less characteristic incident\r\nhappened. A Cossack passenger wished to be set down at a place where\r\nthere was no pier, and on being informed that there was no means of\r\nlanding him, coolly jumped overboard and walked ashore. This simple\r\nmethod of disembarking cannot, of course, be recommended to those who\r\nhave no local knowledge regarding the exact position of sand-banks and\r\ndeep pools.\r\n\r\nGood serviceable fellows are those Cossacks who drag the steamer off\r\nthe sand-banks, and are often entertaining companions. Many of them can\r\nrelate from their own experience, in plain, unvarnished style,\r\nstirring episodes of irregular warfare, and if they happen to be in\r\na communicative mood they may divulge a few secrets regarding their\r\nsimple, primitive commissariat system. Whether they are confidential\r\nor not, the traveller who knows the language will spend his time\r\nmore profitably and pleasantly in chatting with them than in gazing\r\nlistlessly at the uninteresting country through which he is passing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these Don steamers carry a large number of free\r\npassengers of another and more objectionable kind, who do not confine\r\nthemselves to the deck, but unceremoniously find their way into the\r\ncabin, and prevent thin-skinned travellers from sleeping. I know too\r\nlittle of natural history to decide whether these agile, bloodthirsty\r\nparasites are of the same species as those which in England assist\r\nunofficially the Sanitary Commissioners by punishing uncleanliness;\r\nbut I may say that their function in the system of created things is\r\nessentially the same, and they fulfil it with a zeal and energy beyond\r\nall praise. Possessing for my own part a happy immunity from their\r\nindelicate attentions, and being perfectly innocent of entomological\r\ncuriosity, I might, had I been alone, have overlooked their existence,\r\nbut I was constantly reminded of their presence by less happily\r\nconstituted mortals, and the complaints of the sufferers received a\r\ncurious official confirmation. On arriving at the end of the journey\r\nI asked permission to spend the night on board, and I noticed that the\r\ncaptain acceded to my request with more readiness and warmth than I\r\nexpected. Next morning the fact was fully explained. When I began\r\nto express my thanks for having been allowed to pass the night in a\r\ncomfortable cabin, my host interrupted me with a good-natured laugh, and\r\nassured me that, on the contrary, he was under obligations to me. \"You\r\nsee,\" he said, assuming an air of mock gravity, \"I have always on board\r\na large body of light cavalry, and when I have all this part of the ship\r\nto myself they make a combined attack on me; whereas, when some one is\r\nsleeping close by, they divide their forces!\"\r\n\r\nOn certain steamers on the Sea of Azof the privacy of the sleeping-cabin\r\nis disturbed by still more objectionable intruders; I mean rats. During\r\none short voyage which I made on board the Kertch, these disagreeable\r\nvisitors became so importunate in the lower regions of the vessel that\r\nthe ladies obtained permission to sleep in the deck-saloon. After this\r\narrangement had been made, we unfortunate male passengers received\r\nredoubled attention from our tormentors. Awakened early one morning\r\nby the sensation of something running over me as I lay in my berth, I\r\nconceived a method of retaliation. It seemed to me possible that, in the\r\nevent of another visit, I might, by seizing the proper moment, kick the\r\nrat up to the ceiling with such force as to produce concussion of the\r\nbrain and instant death. Very soon I had an opportunity of putting my\r\nplan into execution. A significant shaking of the little curtain at the\r\nfoot of the berth showed that it was being used as a scaling-ladder. I\r\nlay perfectly still, quite as much interested in the sport as if I had\r\nbeen waiting, rifle in hand, for big game. Soon the intruder peeped\r\ninto my berth, looked cautiously around him, and then proceeded to walk\r\nstealthily across my feet. In an instant he was shot upwards. First was\r\nheard a sharp knock on the ceiling, and then a dull \"thud\" on the floor.\r\nThe precise extent of the injuries inflicted I never discovered, for\r\nthe victim had sufficient strength and presence of mind to effect his\r\nescape; and the gentleman at the other side of the cabin, who had been\r\nroused by the noise, protested against my repeating the experiment,\r\non the ground that, though he was willing to take his own share of the\r\nintruders, he strongly objected to having other people\u0027s rats kicked\r\ninto his berth.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions it is of no use to complain to the authorities. When\r\nI met the captain on deck I related to him what had happened,\r\nand protested vigorously against passengers being exposed to such\r\nannoyances. After listening to me patiently, he coolly replied, entirely\r\noverlooking my protestations, \"Ah! I did better than that this morning;\r\nI allowed my rat to get under the blanket, and then smothered him!\"\r\n\r\nRailways and steamboats, even when their arrangements leave much to be\r\ndesired, invariably effect a salutary revolution in hotel accommodation;\r\nbut this revolution is of necessity gradual. Foreign hotelkeepers must\r\nimmigrate and give the example; suitable houses must be built; servants\r\nmust be properly trained; and, above all, the native travellers must\r\nlearn the usages of civilised society. In Russia this revolution is in\r\nprogress, but still far from being complete. The cities where foreigners\r\nmost do congregate--St. Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa--already possess\r\nhotels that will bear comparison with those of Western Europe, and\r\nsome of the more important provincial towns can offer very respectable\r\naccommodation; but there is still much to be done before the\r\nWest-European can travel with comfort even on the principal routes.\r\nCleanliness, the first and most essential element of comfort, as we\r\nunderstand the term, is still a rare commodity, and often cannot be\r\nprocured at any price.\r\n\r\nEven in good hotels, when they are of the genuine Russian type, there\r\nare certain peculiarities which, though not in themselves objectionable,\r\nstrike a foreigner as peculiar. Thus, when you alight at such an hotel,\r\nyou are expected to examine a considerable number of rooms, and to\r\ninquire about the respective prices. When you have fixed upon a suitable\r\napartment, you will do well, if you wish to practise economy, to\r\npropose to the landlord considerably less than he demands; and you will\r\ngenerally find, if you have a talent for bargaining, that the rooms\r\nmay be hired for somewhat less than the sum first stated. You must be\r\ncareful, however, to leave no possibility of doubt as to the terms of\r\nthe contract. Perhaps you assume that, as in taking a cab, a horse is\r\nalways supplied without special stipulation, so in hiring a bedroom\r\nthe bargain includes a bed and the necessary appurtenances. Such an\r\nassumption will not always be justified. The landlord may perhaps give\r\nyou a bedstead without extra charge, but if he be uncorrupted by foreign\r\nnotions, he will certainly not spontaneously supply you with bed-linen,\r\npillows, blankets, and towels. On the contrary, he will assume that you\r\ncarry all these articles with you, and if you do not, you must pay for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis ancient custom has produced among Russians of the old school a kind\r\nof fastidiousness to which we are strangers. They strongly dislike\r\nusing sheets, blankets, and towels which are in a certain sense public\r\nproperty, just as we should strongly object to putting on clothes which\r\nhad been already worn by other people. And the feeling may be developed\r\nin people not Russian by birth. For my own part, I confess to having\r\nbeen conscious of a certain disagreeable feeling on returning in this\r\nrespect to the usages of so-called civilised Europe.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience of carrying about the essential articles of bedroom\r\nfurniture is by no means so great as might be supposed. Bedrooms in\r\nRussia are always heated during cold weather, so that one light blanket,\r\nwhich may be also used as a railway rug, is quite sufficient, whilst\r\nsheets, pillow-cases, and towels take up little space in a portmanteau.\r\nThe most cumbrous object is the pillow, for air-cushions, having a\r\ndisagreeable odour, are not well suited for the purpose. But Russians\r\nare accustomed to this encumbrance. In former days--as at the present\r\ntime in those parts of the country where there are neither railways\r\nnor macadamised roads--people travelled in carts or carriages without\r\nsprings and in these instruments of torture a huge pile of cushions\r\nor pillows is necessary to avoid contusions and dislocations. On the\r\nrailways the jolts and shaking are not deadly enough to require such\r\nan antidote; but, even in unconservative Russia, customs outlive the\r\nconditions that created them; and at every railway-station you may see\r\nmen and women carrying about their pillows with them as we carry wraps.\r\nA genuine Russian merchant who loves comfort and respects tradition\r\nmay travel without a portmanteau, but he considers his pillow as an\r\nindispensable article de voyage.\r\n\r\nTo return to the old-fashioned hotel. When you have completed the\r\nnegotiations with the landlord, you will notice that, unless you have a\r\nservant with you, the waiter prepares to perform the duties of valet de\r\nchambre. Do not be surprised at his officiousness, which seems founded\r\non the assumption that you are three-fourths paralysed. Formerly, every\r\nwell-born Russian had a valet always in attendance, and never dreamed\r\nof doing for himself anything which could by any possibility be done\r\nfor him. You notice that there is no bell in the room, and no mechanical\r\nmeans of communicating with the world below stairs. That is because the\r\nattendant is supposed to be always within call, and it is so much easier\r\nto shout than to get up and ring the bell.\r\n\r\nIn the good old times all this was quite natural. The well-born Russian\r\nhad commonly a superabundance of domestic serfs, and there was no reason\r\nwhy one or two of them should not accompany their master when his Honour\r\nundertook a journey. An additional person in the tarantass did not\r\nincrease the expense, and considerably diminished the little unavoidable\r\ninconveniences of travel. But times have changed. In 1861 the domestic\r\nserfs were emancipated by Imperial ukaz. Free servants demand wages; and\r\non railways or steamers a single ticket does not include an attendant.\r\nThe present generation must therefore get through life with a more\r\nmodest supply of valets, and must learn to do with its own hands much\r\nthat was formerly performed by serf labour. Still, a gentleman brought\r\nup in the old conditions cannot be expected to dress himself without\r\nassistance, and accordingly the waiter remains in your room to act as\r\nvalet. Perhaps, too, in the early morning you may learn in an unpleasant\r\nway that other parts of the old system are not yet extinct. You may\r\nhear, for instance, resounding along the corridors such an order\r\nas--\"Petrusha! Petrusha! Stakán vodý!\" (\"Little Peter, little Peter, a\r\nglass of water!\") shouted in a stentorian voice that would startle the\r\nSeven Sleepers.\r\n\r\nWhen the toilet operations are completed, and you order tea--one always\r\norders tea in Russia--you will be asked whether you have your own tea\r\nand sugar with you. If you are an experienced traveller you will be able\r\nto reply in the affirmative, for good tea can be bought only in certain\r\nwell-known shops, and can rarely be found in hotels. A huge, steaming\r\ntea-urn, called a samovar--etymologically, a \"self-boiler\"--will be\r\nbrought in, and you will make your tea according to your taste. The\r\ntumbler, you know of course, is to be used as a cup, and when using it\r\nyou must be careful not to cauterise the points of your fingers. If you\r\nshould happen to have anything eatable or drinkable in your travelling\r\nbasket, you need not hesitate to take it out at once, for the waiter\r\nwill not feel at all aggrieved or astonished at your doing nothing \"for\r\nthe good of the house.\" The twenty or twenty-five kopeks that you pay\r\nfor the samovar--teapot, tumbler, saucer, spoon, and slop-basin being\r\nincluded under the generic term pribor--frees you from all corkage and\r\nsimilar dues.\r\n\r\nThese and other remnants of old customs are now rapidly disappearing,\r\nand will, doubtless, in a very few years be things of the past--things\r\nto be picked up in out-of-the-way corners, and chronicled by social\r\narchaeology; but they are still to be found in towns not unknown to\r\nWestern Europe.\r\n\r\nMany of these old customs, and especially the old method of travelling,\r\nmay be studied in their pristine purity throughout a great part of the\r\ncountry. Though railway construction has been pushed forward with great\r\nenergy during the last forty years, there are still vast regions where\r\nthe ancient solitudes have never been disturbed by the shrill whistle\r\nof the locomotive, and roads have remained in their primitive condition.\r\nEven in the central provinces one may still travel hundreds of miles\r\nwithout ever encountering anything that recalls the name of Macadam.\r\n\r\nIf popular rumour is to be trusted, there is somewhere in the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, by the side of a turnpike, a large stone bearing the\r\nfollowing doggerel inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you had seen this road before it was made, You\u0027d lift up your hands\r\nand bless General Wade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAny educated Englishman reading this strange announcement would\r\nnaturally remark that the first line of the couplet contains a logical\r\ncontradiction, probably of Hibernian origin; but I have often thought,\r\nduring my wanderings in Russia, that the expression, if not logically\r\njustifiable, might for the sake of vulgar convenience be legalised by a\r\nPermissive Bill. The truth is that, as a Frenchman might say, \"there\r\nare roads and roads\"--roads made and roads unmade, roads artificial\r\nand roads natural. Now, in Russia, roads are nearly all of the unmade,\r\nnatural kind, and are so conservative in their nature that they have at\r\nthe present day precisely the same appearance as they had many centuries\r\nago. They have thus for imaginative minds something of what is called\r\n\"the charm of historical association.\" The only perceptible change that\r\ntakes place in them during a series of generations is that the ruts\r\nshift their position. When these become so deep that fore-wheels can no\r\nlonger fathom them, it becomes necessary to begin making a new pair of\r\nruts to the right or left of the old ones; and as the roads are commonly\r\nof gigantic breadth, there is no difficulty in finding a place for the\r\noperation. How the old ones get filled up I cannot explain; but as\r\nI have rarely seen in any part of the country, except perhaps in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of towns, a human being engaged in road repairing,\r\nI assume that beneficent Nature somehow accomplishes the task without\r\nhuman assistance, either by means of alluvial deposits, or by some other\r\ncosmical action only known to physical geographers.\r\n\r\nOn the roads one occasionally encounters bridges; and here, again,\r\nI have discovered in Russia a key to the mysteries of Hibernian\r\nphraseology. An Irish member once declared to the House of Commons that\r\nthe Church was \"the bridge that separated the two great sections of the\r\nIrish people.\" As bridges commonly connect rather than separate, the\r\nmetaphor was received with roars of laughter. If the honourable members\r\nwho joined in the hilarious applause had travelled much in Russia, they\r\nwould have been more moderate in their merriment; for in that\r\ncountry, despite the laudable activity of the modern system of local\r\nadministration created in the sixties, bridges often act still as a\r\nbarrier rather than a connecting link, and to cross a river by a\r\nbridge may still be what is termed in popular phrase \"a tempting of\r\nProvidence.\" The cautious driver will generally prefer to take to the\r\nwater, if there is a ford within a reasonable distance, though both he\r\nand his human load may be obliged, in order to avoid getting wet feet,\r\nto assume undignified postures that would afford admirable material for\r\nthe caricaturist. But this little bit of discomfort, even though the\r\nluggage should be soaked in the process of fording, is as nothing\r\ncompared to the danger of crossing by the bridge. As I have no desire\r\nto harrow unnecessarily the feelings of the reader, I refrain from all\r\ndescription of ugly accidents, ending in bruises and fractures,\r\nand shall simply explain in a few words how a successful passage is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nWhen it is possible to approach the bridge without sinking up to the\r\nknees in mud, it is better to avoid all risks by walking over and\r\nwaiting for the vehicle on the other side; and when this is impossible,\r\na preliminary survey is advisable. To your inquiries whether it is safe,\r\nyour yamstchik (post-boy) is sure to reply, \"Nitchevo!\"--a word which,\r\naccording to the dictionaries, means \"nothing\" but which has, in the\r\nmouths of the peasantry, a great variety of meanings, as I may explain\r\nat some future time. In the present case it may be roughly translated.\r\n\"There is no danger.\" \"Nitchevo, Barin, proyedem\" (\"There is no danger,\r\nsir; we shall get over\"), he repeats. You may refer to the generally\r\nrotten appearance of the structure, and point in particular to the great\r\nholes sufficient to engulf half a post-horse. \"Ne bos\u0027, Bog pomozhet\"\r\n(\"Do not fear. God will help\"), replies coolly your phlegmatic Jehu. You\r\nmay have your doubts as to whether in this irreligious age Providence\r\nwill intervene specially for your benefit; but your yamstchik, who has\r\nmore faith or fatalism, leaves you little time to solve the problem.\r\nMaking hurriedly the sign of the cross, he gathers up his reins, waves\r\nhis little whip in the air, and, shouting lustily, urges on his team.\r\nThe operation is not wanting in excitement. First there is a short\r\ndescent; then the horses plunge wildly through a zone of deep mud;\r\nnext comes a fearful jolt, as the vehicle is jerked up on to the first\r\nplanks; then the transverse planks, which are but loosely held in their\r\nplaces, rattle and rumble ominously, as the experienced, sagacious\r\nanimals pick their way cautiously and gingerly among the dangerous holes\r\nand crevices; lastly, you plunge with a horrible jolt into a second\r\nmud zone, and finally regain terra firma, conscious of that pleasant\r\nsensation which a young officer may be supposed to feel after his first\r\ncavalry charge in real warfare.\r\n\r\nOf course here, as elsewhere, familiarity breeds indifference. When you\r\nhave successfully crossed without serious accident a few hundred bridges\r\nof this kind you learn to be as cool and fatalistic as your yamstchik.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has heard of the gigantic reforms that have been\r\nrepeatedly imposed on Russia by a paternal Government may naturally\r\nbe astonished to learn that the roads are still in such a disgraceful\r\ncondition. But for this, as for everything else in the world, there is\r\na good and sufficient reason. The country is still, comparatively\r\nspeaking, thinly populated, and in many regions it is difficult, or\r\npractically impossible, to procure in sufficient quantity stone of any\r\nkind, and especially hard stone fit for road-making. Besides this, when\r\nroads are made, the severity of the climate renders it difficult to keep\r\nthem in good repair.\r\n\r\nWhen a long journey has to be undertaken through a region in which there\r\nare no railways, there are several ways in which it may be effected.\r\nIn former days, when time was of still less value than at present, many\r\nlanded proprietors travelled with their own horses, and carried with\r\nthem, in one or more capacious, lumbering vehicles, all that was\r\nrequired for the degree of civilisation which they had attained; and\r\ntheir requirements were often considerable. The grand seigneur, for\r\ninstance, who spent the greater part of his life amidst the luxury of\r\nthe court society, naturally took with him all the portable elements of\r\ncivilisation. His baggage included, therefore, camp-beds, table-linen,\r\nsilver plate, a batterie de cuisine, and a French cook. The pioneers\r\nand part of the commissariat force were sent on in advance, so that\r\nhis Excellency found at each halting-place everything prepared for his\r\narrival. The poor owner of a few dozen serfs dispensed, of course, with\r\nthe elaborate commissariat department, and contented himself with such\r\nmodest fare as could be packed in the holes and corners of a single\r\ntarantass.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to explain here, parenthetically, what a tarantass\r\nis, for I shall often have occasion to use the word. It may be briefly\r\ndefined as a phaeton without springs. The function of springs\r\nis imperfectly fulfilled by two parallel wooden bars, placed\r\nlongitudinally, on which is fixed the body of the vehicle. It is\r\ncommonly drawn by three horses--a strong, fast trotter in the shafts,\r\nflanked on each side by a light, loosely-attached horse that goes along\r\nat a gallop. The points of the shafts are connected by the duga, which\r\nlooks like a gigantic, badly formed horseshoe rising high above\r\nthe collar of the trotter. To the top of the duga is attached the\r\nbearing-rein, and underneath the highest part of it is fastened a big\r\nbell--in the southern provinces I found two, and sometimes even three\r\nbells--which, when the country is open and the atmosphere still, may be\r\nheard a mile off. The use of the bell is variously explained. Some say\r\nit is in order to frighten the wolves, and others that it is to avoid\r\ncollisions on the narrow forest-paths. But neither of these explanations\r\nis entirely satisfactory. It is used chiefly in summer, when there is no\r\ndanger of an attack from wolves; and the number of bells is greater in\r\nthe south, where there are no forests. Perhaps the original intention\r\nwas--I throw out the hint for the benefit of a certain school of\r\narchaeologists--to frighten away evil spirits; and the practice has been\r\nretained partly from unreasoning conservatism, and partly with a view to\r\nlessen the chances of collisions. As the roads are noiselessly soft,\r\nand the drivers not always vigilant, the dangers of collision are\r\nconsiderably diminished by the ceaseless peal.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the tarantass is well adapted to the conditions in which it\r\nis used. By the curious way in which the horses are harnessed it recalls\r\nthe war-chariot of ancient times. The horse in the shafts is compelled\r\nby the bearing-rein to keep his head high and straight before\r\nhim--though the movement of his ears shows plainly that he would very\r\nmuch like to put it somewhere farther away from the tongue of the\r\nbell--but the side horses gallop freely, turning their heads outwards in\r\nclassical fashion. I believe that this position is assumed not from any\r\nsympathy on the part of these animals for the remains of classical art,\r\nbut rather from the natural desire to keep a sharp eye on the driver.\r\nEvery movement of his right hand they watch with close attention, and as\r\nsoon as they discover any symptoms indicating an intention of using the\r\nwhip they immediately show a desire to quicken the pace.\r\n\r\nNow that the reader has gained some idea of what a tarantass is, we may\r\nreturn to the modes of travelling through the regions which are not yet\r\nsupplied with railways.\r\n\r\nHowever enduring and long-winded horses may be, they must be allowed\r\nsometimes, during a long journey, to rest and feed. Travelling long\r\ndistances with one\u0027s own horses is therefore necessarily a slow\r\noperation, and is now quite antiquated. People who value their time\r\nprefer to make use of the Imperial Post organisation. On all the\r\nprincipal lines of communication there are regular post-stations, at\r\nfrom ten to twenty miles apart, where a certain number of horses and\r\nvehicles are kept for the convenience of travellers. To enjoy\r\nthe privilege of this arrangement, one has to apply to the proper\r\nauthorities for a podorozhnaya--a large sheet of paper stamped with the\r\nImperial Eagle, and bearing the name of the recipient, the destination,\r\nand the number of horses to be supplied. In return, a small sum is paid\r\nfor imaginary road-repairs; the rest of the sum is paid by instalments\r\nat the respective stations.\r\n\r\nArmed with this document you go to the post-station and demand the\r\nrequisite number of horses. Three is the number generally used, but if\r\nyou travel lightly and are indifferent to appearances, you may content\r\nyourself with a pair. The vehicle is a kind of tarantass, but not such\r\nas I have just described. The essentials in both are the same, but those\r\nwhich the Imperial Government provides resemble an enormous cradle on\r\nwheels rather than a phaeton. An armful of hay spread over the bottom of\r\nthe wooden box is supposed to play the part of seats and cushions. You\r\nare expected to sit under the arched covering, and extend your legs so\r\nthat the feet lie beneath the driver\u0027s seat; but it is advisable, unless\r\nthe rain happens to be coming down in torrents, to get this covering\r\nunshipped, and travel without it. When used, it painfully curtails the\r\nlittle freedom of movement that you enjoy, and when you are shot upwards\r\nby some obstruction on the road it is apt to arrest your ascent by\r\ngiving you a violent blow on the top of the head.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that you are in no hurry to start, otherwise your\r\npatience may be sorely tried. The horses, when at last produced, may\r\nseem to you the most miserable screws that it was ever your misfortune\r\nto behold; but you had better refrain from expressing your feelings, for\r\nif you use violent, uncomplimentary language, it may turn out that you\r\nhave been guilty of gross calumny. I have seen many a team composed of\r\nanimals which a third-class London costermonger would have spurned, and\r\nin which it was barely possible to recognise the equine form, do their\r\nduty in highly creditable style, and go along at the rate of ten or\r\ntwelve miles an hour, under no stronger incentive then the voice of the\r\nyamstchik. Indeed, the capabilities of these lean, slouching, ungainly\r\nquadrupeds are often astounding when they are under the guidance of a\r\nman who knows how to drive them. Though such a man commonly carries a\r\nlittle harmless whip, he rarely uses it except by waving it horizontally\r\nin the air. His incitements are all oral. He talks to his cattle as he\r\nwould to animals of his own species--now encouraging them by tender,\r\ncaressing epithets, and now launching at them expressions of indignant\r\nscorn. At one moment they are his \"little doves,\" and at the next they\r\nhave been transformed into \"cursed hounds.\" How far they understand and\r\nappreciate this curious mixture of endearing cajolery and contemptuous\r\nabuse it is difficult to say, but there is no doubt that it somehow has\r\nupon them a strange and powerful influence.\r\n\r\nAny one who undertakes a journey of this kind should possess a\r\nwell-knit, muscular frame and good tough sinews, capable of supporting\r\nan unlimited amount of jolting and shaking; at the same time he should\r\nbe well inured to all the hardships and discomforts incidental to\r\nwhat is vaguely termed \"roughing it.\" When he wishes to sleep in a\r\npost-station, he will find nothing softer than a wooden bench, unless he\r\ncan induce the keeper to put for him on the floor a bundle of hay, which\r\nis perhaps softer, but on the whole more disagreeable than the deal\r\nboard. Sometimes he will not get even the wooden bench, for in ordinary\r\npost-stations there is but one room for travellers, and the two\r\nbenches--there are rarely more--may be already occupied. When he\r\ndoes obtain a bench, and succeeds in falling asleep, he must not be\r\nastonished if he is disturbed once or twice during the night by people\r\nwho use the apartment as a waiting-room whilst the post-horses are being\r\nchanged. These passers-by may even order a samovar, and drink tea,\r\nchat, laugh, smoke, and make themselves otherwise disagreeable, utterly\r\nregardless of the sleepers. Then there are the other intruders, smaller\r\nin size but equally objectionable, of which I have already spoken when\r\ndescribing the steamers on the Don. Regarding them I desire to give\r\nmerely one word of advice: As you will have abundant occupation in the\r\nwork of self-defence, learn to distinguish between belligerents and\r\nneutrals, and follow the simple principle of international law, that\r\nneutrals should not be molested. They may be very ugly, but ugliness\r\ndoes not justify assassination. If, for instance, you should happen\r\nin awaking to notice a few black or brown beetles running about your\r\npillow, restrain your murderous hand! If you kill them you commit an act\r\nof unnecessary bloodshed; for though they may playfully scamper around\r\nyou, they will do you no bodily harm.\r\n\r\nAnother requisite for a journey in unfrequented districts is a knowledge\r\nof the language. It is popularly supposed that if you are familiar with\r\nFrench and German you may travel anywhere in Russia. So far as the great\r\ncities and chief lines of communication are concerned, this may be true,\r\nbut beyond that it is a delusion. The Russian has not, any more than\r\nthe West-European, received from Nature the gift of tongues. Educated\r\nRussians often speak one or two foreign languages fluently, but the\r\npeasants know no language but their own, and it is with the peasantry\r\nthat one comes in contact. And to converse freely with the peasant\r\nrequires a considerable familiarity with the language--far more than is\r\nrequired for simply reading a book. Though there are few provincialisms,\r\nand all classes of the people use the same words--except the words of\r\nforeign origin, which are used only by the upper classes--the peasant\r\nalways speaks in a more laconic and more idiomatic way than the educated\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn the winter months travelling is in some respects pleasanter than in\r\nsummer, for snow and frost are great macadamisers. If the snow falls\r\nevenly, there is for some time the most delightful road that can be\r\nimagined. No jolts, no shaking, but a smooth, gliding motion, like\r\nthat of a boat in calm water, and the horses gallop along as if totally\r\nunconscious of the sledge behind them. Unfortunately, this happy state\r\nof things does not last all through the winter. The road soon gets cut\r\nup, and deep transverse furrows (ukhaby) are formed. How these furrows\r\ncome into existence I have never been able clearly to comprehend, though\r\nI have often heard the phenomenon explained by men who imagined they\r\nunderstood it. Whatever the cause and mode of formation may be, certain\r\nit is that little hills and valleys do get formed, and the sledge, as it\r\ncrosses over them, bobs up and down like a boat in a chopping sea, with\r\nthis important difference, that the boat falls into a yielding liquid,\r\nwhereas the sledge falls upon a solid substance, unyielding and\r\nunelastic. The shaking and jolting which result may readily be imagined.\r\n\r\nThere are other discomforts, too, in winter travelling. So long as\r\nthe air is perfectly still, the cold may be very intense without being\r\ndisagreeable; but if a strong head wind is blowing, and the thermometer\r\never so many degrees below zero, driving in an open sledge is a very\r\ndisagreeable operation, and noses may get frostbitten without their\r\nowners perceiving the fact in time to take preventive measures. Then why\r\nnot take covered sledges on such occasions? For the simple reason that\r\nthey are not to be had; and if they could be procured, it would be well\r\nto avoid using them, for they are apt to produce something very like\r\nseasickness. Besides this, when the sledge gets overturned, it is\r\npleasanter to be shot out on to the clean, refreshing snow than to be\r\nburied ignominiously under a pile of miscellaneous baggage.\r\n\r\nThe chief requisite for winter travelling in these icy regions is a\r\nplentiful supply of warm furs. An Englishman is very apt to be imprudent\r\nin this respect, and to trust too much to his natural power of resisting\r\ncold. To a certain extent this confidence is justifiable, for an\r\nEnglishman often feels quite comfortable in an ordinary great coat when\r\nhis Russian friends consider it necessary to envelop themselves in furs\r\nof the warmest kind; but it may be carried too far, in which case severe\r\npunishment is sure to follow, as I once learned by experience. I may\r\nrelate the incident as a warning to others:\r\n\r\nOne day in mid-winter I started from Novgorod, with the intention of\r\nvisiting some friends at a cavalry barracks situated about ten miles\r\nfrom the town. As the sun was shining brightly, and the distance to\r\nbe traversed was short, I considered that a light fur and a bashlyk--a\r\ncloth hood which protects the ears--would be quite sufficient to keep\r\nout the cold, and foolishly disregarded the warnings of a Russian friend\r\nwho happened to call as I was about to start. Our route lay along the\r\nriver due northward, right in the teeth of a strong north wind. A wintry\r\nnorth wind is always and everywhere a disagreeable enemy to face; let\r\nthe reader try to imagine what it is when the Fahrenheit thermometer\r\nis at 30 degrees below zero--or rather let him refrain from such an\r\nattempt, for the sensation produced cannot be imagined by those who have\r\nnot experienced it. Of course I ought to have turned back--at least,\r\nas soon as a sensation of faintness warned me that the circulation was\r\nbeing seriously impeded--but I did not wish to confess my imprudence to\r\nthe friend who accompanied me. When we had driven about three-fourths of\r\nthe way we met a peasant-woman, who gesticulated violently, and shouted\r\nsomething to us as we passed. I did not hear what she said, but my\r\nfriend turned to me and said in an alarming tone--we had been\r\nspeaking German--\"Mein Gott! Ihre Nase ist abgefroren!\" Now the word\r\n\"abgefroren,\" as the reader will understand, seemed to indicate that\r\nmy nose was frozen off, so I put up my hand in some alarm to discover\r\nwhether I had inadvertently lost the whole or part of the member\r\nreferred to. It was still in situ and entire, but as hard and insensible\r\nas a bit of wood.\r\n\r\n\"You may still save it,\" said my companion, \"if you get out at once and\r\nrub it vigorously with snow.\"\r\n\r\nI got out as directed, but was too faint to do anything vigorously. My\r\nfur cloak flew open, the cold seemed to grasp me in the region of the\r\nheart, and I fell insensible.\r\n\r\nHow long I remained unconscious I know not. When I awoke I found myself\r\nin a strange room, surrounded by dragoon officers in uniform, and the\r\nfirst words I heard were, \"He is out of danger now, but he will have a\r\nfever.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were spoken, as I afterwards discovered, by a very competent\r\nsurgeon; but the prophecy was not fulfilled. The promised fever never\r\ncame. The only bad consequences were that for some days my right hand\r\nremained stiff, and for a week or two I had to conceal my nose from\r\npublic view.\r\n\r\nIf this little incident justifies me in drawing a general conclusion, I\r\nshould say that exposure to extreme cold is an almost painless form\r\nof death; but that the process of being resuscitated is very painful\r\nindeed--so painful, that the patient may be excused for momentarily\r\nregretting that officious people prevented the temporary insensibility\r\nfrom becoming \"the sleep that knows no waking.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the alternate reigns of winter and summer there is always a\r\nshort interregnum, during which travelling in Russia by road is\r\nalmost impossible. Woe to the ill-fated mortal who has to make a long\r\nroad-journey immediately after the winter snow has melted; or, worse\r\nstill, at the beginning of winter, when the autumn mud has been\r\npetrified by the frost, and not yet levelled by the snow!\r\n\r\nAt all seasons the monotony of a journey is pretty sure to be broken by\r\nlittle unforeseen episodes of a more or less disagreeable kind. An axle\r\nbreaks, or a wheel comes off, or there is a difficulty in procuring\r\nhorses. As an illustration of the graver episodes which may occur, I\r\nshall make here a quotation from my note-book:\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we arrived at Maikop, a small town commanding the\r\nentrance to one of the valleys which run up towards the main range\r\nof the Caucasus. On alighting at the post-station, we at once ordered\r\nhorses for the next stage, and received the laconic reply, \"There are no\r\nhorses.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when will there be some?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow!\"\r\n\r\nThis last reply we took for a piece of playful exaggeration, and\r\ndemanded the book in which, according to law, the departure of horses\r\nis duly inscribed, and from which it is easy to calculate when the first\r\nteam should be ready to start. A short calculation proved that we\r\nought to get horses by four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, so we showed the\r\nstation-keeper various documents signed by the Minister of the\r\nInterior and other influential personages, and advised him to avoid all\r\ncontravention of the postal regulations.\r\n\r\nThese documents, which proved that we enjoyed the special protection\r\nof the authorities, had generally been of great service to us in our\r\ndealings with rascally station-keepers; but this station-keeper was not\r\none of the ordinary type. He was a Cossack, of herculean proportions,\r\nwith a bullet-shaped head, short-cropped bristly hair, shaggy eyebrows,\r\nan enormous pendent moustache, a defiant air, and a peculiar expression\r\nof countenance which plainly indicated \"an ugly customer.\" Though it was\r\nstill early in the day, he had evidently already imbibed a considerable\r\nquantity of alcohol, and his whole demeanour showed clearly enough that\r\nhe was not of those who are \"pleasant in their liquor.\" After glancing\r\nsuperciliously at the documents, as if to intimate he could read them\r\nwere he so disposed, he threw them down on the table, and, thrusting his\r\ngigantic paws into his capacious trouser-pockets, remarked slowly and\r\ndecisively, in something deeper than a double-bass voice, \"You\u0027ll have\r\nhorses to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nWishing to avoid a quarrel we tried to hire horses in the village, and\r\nwhen our efforts in that direction proved fruitless, we applied to the\r\nhead of the rural police. He came and used all his influence with the\r\nrefractory station-keeper, but in vain. Hercules was not in a mood to\r\nlisten to officials any more than to ordinary mortals. At last, after\r\nconsiderable trouble to himself, our friend of the police contrived to\r\nfind horses for us, and we contented ourselves with entering an account\r\nof the circumstances in the Complaint Book, but our difficulties were by\r\nno means at an end. As soon as Hercules perceived that we had obtained\r\nhorses without his assistance, and that he had thereby lost his\r\nopportunity of blackmailing us, he offered us one of his own teams, and\r\ninsisted on detaining us until we should cancel the complaint against\r\nhim. This we refused to do, and our relations with him became what is\r\ncalled in diplomatic language \"extremement tendues.\" Again we had to\r\napply to the police.\r\n\r\nMy friend mounted guard over the baggage whilst I went to the police\r\noffice. I was not long absent, but I found, on my return, that important\r\nevents had taken place in the interval. A crowd had collected round\r\nthe post-station, and on the steps stood the keeper and his post-boys,\r\ndeclaring that the traveller inside had attempted to shoot them! I\r\nrushed in and soon perceived, by the smell of gunpowder, that firearms\r\nhad been used, but found no trace of casualties. My friend was tramping\r\nup and down the little room, and evidently for the moment there was an\r\narmistice.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time the local authorities had assembled, a candle had\r\nbeen lit, two armed Cossacks stood as sentries at the door, and the\r\npreliminary investigation had begun. The Chief of Police sat at the\r\ntable and wrote rapidly on a sheet of foolscap. The investigation showed\r\nthat two shots had been fired from a revolver, and two bullets were\r\nfound imbedded in the wall. All those who had been present, and some who\r\nknew nothing of the incident except by hearsay, were duly examined. Our\r\nopponents always assumed that my friend had been the assailant, in\r\nspite of his protestations to the contrary, and more than once the\r\nwords pokyshenie na ubiistvo (attempt to murder) were pronounced. Things\r\nlooked very black indeed. We had the prospect of being detained for days\r\nand weeks in the miserable place, till the insatiable demon of official\r\nformality had been propitiated. And then?\r\n\r\nWhen things were thus at their blackest they suddenly took an unexpected\r\nturn, and the deus ex machinâ appeared precisely at the right moment,\r\njust as if we had all been puppets in a sensation novel. There was\r\nthe usual momentary silence, and then, mixed with the sound of an\r\napproaching tarantass, a confused murmur: \"There he is! He is coming!\"\r\nThe \"he\" thus vaguely and mysteriously indicated turned out to be an\r\nofficial of the judicial administration, who had reason to visit the\r\nvillage for an entirely different affair. As soon as he had been told\r\nbriefly what had happened he took the matter in hand and showed himself\r\nequal to the occasion. Unlike the majority of Russian officials he\r\ndisliked lengthy procedure, and succeeded in making the case quite clear\r\nin a very short time. There had been, he perceived, no attempt to murder\r\nor anything of the kind. The station-keeper and his two post-boys, who\r\nhad no right to be in the traveller\u0027s room, had entered with threatening\r\nmien, and when they refused to retire peaceably, my friend had fired\r\ntwo shots in order to frighten them and bring assistance. The falsity of\r\ntheir statement that he had fired at them as they entered the room was\r\nproved by the fact that the bullets were lodged near the ceiling in the\r\nwall farthest away from the door.\r\n\r\nI must confess that I was agreeably surprised by this unexpected turn\r\nof affairs. The conclusions arrived at were nothing more than a simple\r\nstatement of what had taken place; but I was surprised at the fact that\r\na man who was at once a lawyer and a Russian official should have been\r\nable to take such a plain, commonsense view of the case.\r\n\r\nBefore midnight we were once more free men, driving rapidly in the\r\nclear moonlight to the next station, under the escort of a fully-armed\r\nCircassian Cossack; but the idea that we might have been detained for\r\nweeks in that miserable place haunted us like a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIN THE NORTHERN FORESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBird\u0027s-eye View of Russia--The Northern Forests--Purpose of\r\nmy Journey--Negotiations--The Road--A Village--A Peasant\u0027s\r\nHouse--Vapour-Baths--Curious Custom--Arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of describing a country that one has visited. The\r\nsimplest and most common method is to give a chronological account of\r\nthe journey; and this is perhaps the best way when the journey does\r\nnot extend over more than a few weeks. But it cannot be conveniently\r\nemployed in the case of a residence of many years. Did I adopt it, I\r\nshould very soon exhaust the reader\u0027s patience. I should have to take\r\nhim with me to a secluded village, and make him wait for me till I had\r\nlearned to speak the language. Thence he would have to accompany me to\r\na provincial town, and spend months in a public office, whilst I\r\nendeavoured to master the mysteries of local self-government. After\r\nthis he would have to spend two years with me in a big library, where I\r\nstudied the history and literature of the country. And so on, and so\r\non. Even my journeys would prove tedious to him, as they often were to\r\nmyself, for he would have to drive with me many a score of weary miles,\r\nwhere even the most zealous diary-writer would find nothing to record\r\nbeyond the names of the post-stations.\r\n\r\nIt will be well for me, then, to avoid the strictly chronological\r\nmethod, and confine myself to a description of the more striking objects\r\nand incidents that came under my notice. The knowledge which I derived\r\nfrom books will help me to supply a running commentary on what I\r\nhappened to see and hear.\r\n\r\nInstead of beginning in the usual way with St. Petersburg, I prefer for\r\nmany reasons to leave the description of the capital till some future\r\ntime, and plunge at once into the great northern forest region.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to get a bird\u0027s-eye view of European Russia, the\r\nspectator would perceive that the country is composed of two halves\r\nwidely differing from each other in character. The northern half is a\r\nland of forest and morass, plentifully supplied with water in the form\r\nof rivers, lakes, and marshes, and broken up by numerous patches of\r\ncultivation. The southern half is, as it were, the other side of\r\nthe pattern--an immense expanse of rich, arable land, broken up by\r\noccasional patches of sand or forest. The imaginary undulating line\r\nseparating those two regions starts from the western frontier about the\r\n50th parallel of latitude, and runs in a northeasterly direction till it\r\nenters the Ural range at about 56 degrees N.L.\r\n\r\nWell do I remember my first experience of travel in the northern region,\r\nand the weeks of voluntary exile which formed the goal of the journey.\r\nIt was in the summer of 1870. My reason for undertaking the journey was\r\nthis: a few months of life in St. Petersburg had fully convinced me that\r\nthe Russian language is one of those things which can only be acquired\r\nby practice, and that even a person of antediluvian longevity might\r\nspend all his life in that city without learning to express himself\r\nfluently in the vernacular--especially if he has the misfortune of\r\nbeing able to speak English, French, and German. With his friends and\r\nassociates he speaks French or English. German serves as a medium of\r\ncommunication with waiters, shop keepers, and other people of that\r\nclass. It is only with isvoshtchiki--the drivers of the little open\r\ndroshkis which fulfil the function of cabs--that he is obliged to use\r\nthe native tongue, and with them a very limited vocabulary suffices. The\r\nordinal numerals and four short, easily-acquired expressions--poshól\r\n(go on), na právo (to the right), na lyévo (to the left), and stoi\r\n(stop)--are all that is required.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was considering how I could get beyond the sphere of\r\nWest-European languages, a friend came to my assistance, and suggested\r\nthat I should go to his estate in the province of Novgorod, where I\r\nshould find an intelligent, amiable parish priest, quite innocent of\r\nany linguistic acquirements. This proposal I at once adopted, and\r\naccordingly found myself one morning at a small station of the Moscow\r\nRailway, endeavouring to explain to a peasant in sheep\u0027s clothing that\r\nI wished to be conveyed to Ivanofka, the village where my future teacher\r\nlived. At that time I still spoke Russian in a very fragmentary and\r\nconfused way--pretty much as Spanish cows are popularly supposed to\r\nspeak French. My first remark therefore being literally interpreted,\r\nwas--\"Ivanofka. Horses. You can?\" The point of interrogation was\r\nexpressed by a simultaneous raising of the voice and the eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"Ivanofka?\" cried the peasant, in an interrogatory tone of voice.\r\nIn Russia, as in other countries, the peasantry when speaking with\r\nstrangers like to repeat questions, apparently for the purpose of\r\ngaining time.\r\n\r\n\"Ivanofka,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now!\"\r\n\r\nAfter some reflection the peasant nodded and said something which I did\r\nnot understand, but which I assumed to mean that he was open to consider\r\nproposals for transporting me to my destination.\r\n\r\n\"Roubles. How many?\"\r\n\r\nTo judge by the knitting of the brows and the scratching of the head,\r\nI should say that that question gave occasion to a very abstruse\r\nmathematical calculation. Gradually the look of concentrated attention\r\ngave place to an expression such as children assume when they endeavour\r\nto get a parental decision reversed by means of coaxing. Then came a\r\nstream of soft words which were to me utterly unintelligible.\r\n\r\nI must not weary the reader with a detailed account of the succeeding\r\nnegotiations, which were conducted with extreme diplomatic caution\r\non both sides, as if a cession of territory or the payment of a war\r\nindemnity had been the subject of discussion. Three times he drove away\r\nand three times returned. Each time he abated his pretensions, and each\r\ntime I slightly increased my offer. At last, when I began to fear that\r\nhe had finally taken his departure and had left me to my own devices, he\r\nre-entered the room and took up my baggage, indicating thereby that he\r\nagreed to my last offer.\r\n\r\nThe sum agreed upon would have been, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nmore than sufficient, but before proceeding far I discovered that the\r\ncircumstances were by no means ordinary, and I began to understand the\r\npantomimic gesticulation which had puzzled me during the negotiations.\r\nHeavy rain had fallen without interruption for several days, and now the\r\ntrack on which we were travelling could not, without poetical license,\r\nbe described as a road. In some parts it resembled a water-course, in\r\nothers a quagmire, and at least during the first half of the journey I\r\nwas constantly reminded of that stage in the work of creation when the\r\nwater was not yet separated from the dry land. During the few moments\r\nwhen the work of keeping my balance and preventing my baggage from being\r\nlost did not engross all my attention, I speculated on the possibility\r\nof inventing a boat-carriage, to be drawn by some amphibious quadruped.\r\nFortunately our two lean, wiry little horses did not object to being\r\nused as aquatic animals. They took the water bravely, and plunged\r\nthrough the mud in gallant style. The telega in which we were seated--a\r\nfour-wheeled skeleton cart--did not submit to the ill-treatment so\r\nsilently. It creaked out its remonstrances and entreaties, and at\r\nthe more difficult spots threatened to go to pieces; but its owner\r\nunderstood its character and capabilities, and paid no attention to its\r\nominous threats. Once, indeed, a wheel came off, but it was soon fished\r\nout of the mud and replaced, and no further casualty occurred.\r\n\r\nThe horses did their work so well that when about midday we arrived at\r\na village, I could not refuse to let them have some rest and\r\nrefreshment--all the more as my own thoughts had begun to turn in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe village, like villages in that part of the country generally,\r\nconsisted of two long parallel rows of wooden houses. The road--if a\r\nstratum of deep mud can be called by that name--formed the intervening\r\nspace. All the houses turned their gables to the passerby, and some of\r\nthem had pretensions to architectural decoration in the form of rude\r\nperforated woodwork. Between the houses, and in a line with them, were\r\ngreat wooden gates and high wooden fences, separating the courtyards\r\nfrom the road. Into one of these yards, near the farther end of the\r\nvillage, our horses turned of their own accord.\r\n\r\n\"An inn?\" I said, in an interrogative tone.\r\n\r\nThe driver shook his head and said something, in which I detected the\r\nword \"friend.\" Evidently there was no hostelry for man and beast in the\r\nvillage, and the driver was using a friend\u0027s house for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe yard was flanked on the one side by an open shed, containing rude\r\nagricultural implements which might throw some light on the agriculture\r\nof the primitive Aryans, and on the other side by the dwelling-house and\r\nstable. Both the house and stable were built of logs, nearly cylindrical\r\nin form, and placed in horizontal tiers.\r\n\r\nTwo of the strongest of human motives, hunger and curiosity, impelled me\r\nto enter the house at once. Without waiting for an invitation, I went\r\nup to the door--half protected against the winter snows by a small open\r\nportico--and unceremoniously walked in. The first apartment was empty,\r\nbut I noticed a low door in the wall to the left, and passing through\r\nthis, entered the principal room. As the scene was new to me, I noted\r\nthe principal objects. In the wall before me were two small square\r\nwindows looking out upon the road, and in the corner to the right,\r\nnearer to the ceiling than to the floor, was a little triangular shelf,\r\non which stood a religious picture. Before the picture hung a curious\r\noil lamp. In the corner to the left of the door was a gigantic stove,\r\nbuilt of brick, and whitewashed. From the top of the stove to the wall\r\non the right stretched what might be called an enormous shelf, six or\r\neight feet in breadth. This is the so-called palati, as I afterwards\r\ndiscovered, and serves as a bed for part of the family. The furniture\r\nconsisted of a long wooden bench attached to the wall on the right, a\r\nbig, heavy, deal table, and a few wooden stools.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was leisurely surveying these objects, I heard a noise on the\r\ntop of the stove, and, looking up, perceived a human face, with long\r\nhair parted in the middle, and a full yellow beard. I was considerably\r\nastonished by this apparition, for the air in the room was stifling,\r\nand I had some difficulty in believing that any created being--except\r\nperhaps a salamander or a negro--could exist in such a position. I\r\nlooked hard to convince myself that I was not the victim of a delusion.\r\nAs I stared, the head nodded slowly and pronounced the customary form of\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\nI returned the greeting slowly, wondering what was to come next.\r\n\r\n\"Ill, very ill!\" sighed the head.\r\n\r\n\"I\u0027m not astonished at that,\" I remarked, in an \"aside.\" \"If I were\r\nlying on the stove as you are I should be very ill too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hot, very hot?\" I remarked, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"Nitchevo\"--that is to say, \"not particularly.\" This remark astonished\r\nme all the more as I noticed that the body to which the head belonged\r\nwas enveloped in a sheep-skin!\r\n\r\nAfter living some time in Russia I was no longer surprised by such\r\nincidents, for I soon discovered that the Russian peasant has a\r\nmarvellous power of bearing extreme heat as well as extreme cold. When\r\na coachman takes his master or mistress to the theatre or to a party,\r\nhe never thinks of going home and returning at an appointed time. Hour\r\nafter hour he sits placidly on the box, and though the cold be of an\r\nintensity such as is never experienced in our temperate climate, he\r\ncan sleep as tranquilly as the lazzaroni at midday in Naples. In that\r\nrespect the Russian peasant seems to be first-cousin to the polar\r\nbear, but, unlike the animals of the Arctic regions, he is not at all\r\nincommoded by excessive heat. On the contrary, he likes it when he can\r\nget it, and never omits an opportunity of laying in a reserve supply of\r\ncaloric. He even delights in rapid transitions from one extreme to\r\nthe other, as is amply proved by a curious custom which deserves to be\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThe reader must know that in the life of the Russian peasantry the\r\nweekly vapour-bath plays a most important part. It has even a certain\r\nreligious signification, for no good orthodox peasant would dare to\r\nenter a church after being soiled by certain kinds of pollution without\r\ncleansing himself physically and morally by means of the bath. In the\r\nweekly arrangements it forms the occupation for Saturday afternoon, and\r\ncare is taken to avoid thereafter all pollution until after the morning\r\nservice on Sunday. Many villages possess a public or communal bath of\r\nthe most primitive construction, but in some parts of the country--I\r\nam not sure how far the practice extends--the peasants take their\r\nvapour-bath in the household oven in which the bread is baked! In\r\nall cases the operation is pushed to the extreme limit of human\r\nendurance--far beyond the utmost limit that can be endured by those who\r\nhave not been accustomed to it from childhood. For my own part, I only\r\nmade the experiment once; and when I informed my attendant that my life\r\nwas in danger from congestion of the brain, he laughed outright, and\r\ntold me that the operation had only begun. Most astounding of all--and\r\nthis brings me to the fact which led me into this digression--the\r\npeasants in winter often rush out of the bath and roll themselves in the\r\nsnow! This aptly illustrates a common Russian proverb, which says that\r\nwhat is health to the Russian is death to the German.\r\n\r\nCold water, as well as hot vapour, is sometimes used as a means of\r\npurification. In the villages the old pagan habit of masquerading in\r\nabsurd costumes at certain seasons--as is done during the carnival in\r\nRoman Catholic countries with the approval, or at least connivance,\r\nof the Church--still survives; but it is regarded as not altogether\r\nsinless. He who uses such disguises places himself to a certain extent\r\nunder the influence of the Evil One, thereby putting his soul in\r\njeopardy; and to free himself from this danger he has to purify himself\r\nin the following way: When the annual mid-winter ceremony of blessing\r\nthe waters is performed, by breaking a hole in the ice and immersing a\r\ncross with certain religious rites, he should plunge into the hole as\r\nsoon as possible after the ceremony. I remember once at Yaroslavl,\r\non the Volga, two young peasants successfully accomplished this\r\nfeat--though the police have orders to prevent it--and escaped,\r\napparently without evil consequences, though the Fahrenheit thermometer\r\nwas below zero. How far the custom has really a purifying influence,\r\nis a question which must be left to theologians; but even an ordinary\r\nmortal can understand that, if it be regarded as a penance, it must\r\nhave a certain deterrent effect. The man who foresees the necessity\r\nof undergoing this severe penance will think twice before putting on a\r\ndisguise. So at least it must have been in the good old times; but in\r\nthese degenerate days--among the Russian peasantry as elsewhere--the\r\nfear of the Devil, which was formerly, if not the beginning, at least\r\none of the essential elements, of wisdom, has greatly decreased. Many\r\na young peasant will now thoughtlessly disguise himself, and when the\r\nconsecration of the water is performed, will stand and look on passively\r\nlike an ordinary spectator! It would seem that the Devil, like his enemy\r\nthe Pope, is destined to lose gradually his temporal power.\r\n\r\nBut all this time I am neglecting my new acquaintance on the top of the\r\nstove. In reality I did not neglect him, but listened most attentively\r\nto every word of the long tale that he recited. What it was all about\r\nI could only vaguely guess, for I did not understand more than ten per\r\ncent of the words used, but I assumed from the tone and gestures that he\r\nwas relating to me all the incidents and symptoms of his illness. And\r\na very severe illness it must have been, for it requires a very\r\nconsiderable amount of physical suffering to make the patient Russian\r\npeasant groan. Before he had finished his tale a woman entered,\r\napparently his wife.\r\n\r\nTo her I explained that I had a strong desire to eat and drink, and that\r\nI wished to know what she would give me. By a good deal of laborious\r\nexplanation I was made to understand that I could have eggs, black\r\nbread, and milk, and we agreed that there should be a division of\r\nlabour: my hostess should prepare the samovar for boiling water, whilst\r\nI should fry the eggs to my own satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the repast was ready, and, though not very delicate,\r\nwas highly acceptable. The tea and sugar I had of course brought with\r\nme; the eggs were not very highly flavoured; and the black rye-bread,\r\nstrongly intermixed with sand, could be eaten by a peculiar and\r\neasily-acquired method of mastication, in which the upper molars are\r\nnever allowed to touch those of the lower jaw. In this way the grating\r\nof the sand between the teeth is avoided.\r\n\r\nEggs, black bread, milk, and tea--these formed my ordinary articles of\r\nfood during all my wanderings in Northern Russia. Occasionally potatoes\r\ncould be got, and afforded the possibility of varying the bill of fare.\r\nThe favourite materials employed in the native cookery are sour cabbage,\r\ncucumbers, and kvass--a kind of very small beer made from black bread.\r\nNone of these can be recommended to the traveller who is not already\r\naccustomed to them.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the journey was accomplished at a rather more rapid\r\npace than the preceding part, for the road was decidedly better, though\r\nit was traversed by numerous half-buried roots, which produced violent\r\njolts. From the conversation of the driver I gathered that wolves,\r\nbears, and elks were found in the forest through which we were passing.\r\n\r\nThe sun had long since set when we reached our destination, and I found\r\nto my dismay that the priest\u0027s house was closed for the night. To rouse\r\nthe reverend personage from his slumbers, and endeavour to explain to\r\nhim with my limited vocabulary the object of my visit, was not to be\r\nthought of. On the other hand, there was no inn of any kind in the\r\nvicinity. When I consulted the driver as to what was to be done, he\r\nmeditated for a little, and then pointed to a large house at some\r\ndistance where there were still lights. It turned out to be the\r\ncountry-house of the gentleman who had advised me to undertake the\r\njourney, and here, after a short explanation, though the owner was not\r\nat home, I was hospitably received.\r\n\r\nIt had been my intention to live in the priest\u0027s house, but a short\r\ninterview with him on the following day convinced me that that part\r\nof my plan could not be carried out. The preliminary objections that I\r\nshould find but poor fare in his humble household, and much more of\r\nthe same kind, were at once put aside by my assurance, made partly by\r\npantomime, that, as an old traveller, I was well accustomed to simple\r\nfare, and could always accommodate myself to the habits of people\r\namong whom my lot happened to be cast. But there was a more serious\r\ndifficulty. The priest\u0027s family had, as is generally the case with\r\npriests\u0027 families, been rapidly increasing during the last few years,\r\nand his house had not been growing with equal rapidity. The natural\r\nconsequence of this was that he had not a room or a bed to spare. The\r\nlittle room which he had formerly kept for occasional visitors was now\r\noccupied by his eldest daughter, who had returned from a \"school for\r\nthe daughters of the clergy,\" where she had been for the last two years.\r\nUnder these circumstances, I was constrained to accept the kind proposal\r\nmade to me by the representative of my absent friend, that I should\r\ntake up my quarters in one of the numerous unoccupied rooms in the\r\nmanor-house. This arrangement, I was reminded, would not at all\r\ninterfere with my proposed studies, for the priest lived close at hand,\r\nand I might spend with him as much time as I liked.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me introduce the reader to my reverend teacher and one\r\nor two other personages whose acquaintance I made during my voluntary\r\nexile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nVOLUNTARY EXILE\r\n\r\n\r\nIvanofka--History of the Place--The Steward of the Estate--Slav and\r\nTeutonic Natures--A German\u0027s View of the Emancipation--Justices of the\r\nPeace--New School of Morals--The Russian Language--Linguistic Talent of\r\nthe Russians--My Teacher--A Big Dose of Current History.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis village, Ivanofka by name, in which I proposed to spend some\r\nmonths, was rather more picturesque than villages in these northern\r\nforests commonly are. The peasants\u0027 huts, built on both sides of a\r\nstraight road, were colourless enough, and the big church, with its five\r\npear-shaped cupolas rising out of the bright green roof and its ugly\r\nbelfry in the Renaissance style, was not by any means beautiful in\r\nitself; but when seen from a little distance, especially in the soft\r\nevening twilight, the whole might have been made the subject of a\r\nvery pleasing picture. From the point that a landscape-painter would\r\nnaturally have chosen, the foreground was formed by a meadow, through\r\nwhich flowed sluggishly a meandering stream. On a bit of rising ground\r\nto the right, and half concealed by an intervening cluster of old\r\nrich-coloured pines, stood the manor-house--a big, box-shaped,\r\nwhitewashed building, with a verandah in front, overlooking a small plot\r\nthat might some day become a flower-garden. To the left of this stood\r\nthe village, the houses grouping prettily with the big church, and a\r\nlittle farther in this direction was an avenue of graceful birches. On\r\nthe extreme left were fields, bounded by a dark border of fir-trees.\r\nCould the spectator have raised himself a few hundred feet from the\r\nground, he would have seen that there were fields beyond the village,\r\nand that the whole of this agricultural oasis was imbedded in a forest\r\nstretching in all directions as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nThe history of the place may be told in a few words. In former times the\r\nestate, including the village and all its inhabitants, had belonged to\r\na monastery, but when, in 1764, the Church lands were secularised by\r\nCatherine, it became the property of the State. Some years afterwards\r\nthe Empress granted it, with the serfs and everything else which it\r\ncontained, to an old general who had distinguished himself in the\r\nTurkish wars. From that time it had remained in the K---- family.\r\nSome time between the years 1820 and 1840 the big church and the\r\nmansion-house had been built by the actual possessor\u0027s father, who loved\r\ncountry life, and devoted a large part of his time and energies to\r\nthe management of his estate. His son, on the contrary, preferred St.\r\nPetersburg to the country, served in one of the public offices, loved\r\npassionately French plays and other products of urban civilisation,\r\nand left the entire management of the property to a German steward,\r\npopularly known as Karl Karl\u0027itch, whom I shall introduce to the reader\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nThe village annals contained no important events, except bad harvests,\r\ncattle-plagues, and destructive fires, with which the inhabitants seem\r\nto have been periodically visited from time immemorial. If good\r\nharvests were ever experienced, they must have faded from the popular\r\nrecollection. Then there were certain ancient traditions which might\r\nhave been lessened in bulk and improved in quality by being subjected to\r\nsearching historical criticism. More than once, for instance, a leshie,\r\nor wood-sprite, had been seen in the neighbourhood; and in several\r\nhouseholds the domovoi, or brownie, had been known to play strange\r\npranks until he was properly propitiated. And as a set-off against these\r\nmanifestations of evil powers, there were well-authenticated stories\r\nabout a miracle-working image that had mysteriously appeared on the\r\nbranch of a tree, and about numerous miraculous cures that had been\r\neffected by means of pilgrimages to holy shrines.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to introduce the principal personages of this little\r\ncommunity. Of these, by far the most important was Karl Karl\u0027itch, the\r\nsteward.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I ought, perhaps, to explain how Karl Schmidt, the son of\r\na well-to-do Bauer in the Prussian village of Schonhausen, became Karl\r\nKarl\u0027itch, the principal personage in the Russian village of Ivanofka.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the Crimean War many of the Russian landed proprietors\r\nhad become alive to the necessity of improving the primitive,\r\ntraditional methods of agriculture, and sought for this purpose German\r\nstewards for their estates. Among these proprietors was the owner of\r\nIvanofka. Through the medium of a friend in Berlin he succeeded in\r\nengaging for a moderate salary a young man who had just finished his\r\nstudies in one of the German schools of agriculture--the institution at\r\nHohenheim, if my memory does not deceive me. This young man had arrived\r\nin Russia as plain Karl Schmidt, but his name was soon transformed into\r\nKarl Karl\u0027itch, not from any desire of his own, but in accordance with\r\na curious Russian custom. In Russia one usually calls a man not by his\r\nfamily name, but by his Christian name and patronymic--the latter being\r\nformed from the name of his father. Thus, if a man\u0027s name is Nicholas,\r\nand his father\u0027s Christian name is--or was--Ivan, you address him as\r\nNikolai Ivanovitch (pronounced Ivan\u0027itch); and if this man should happen\r\nto have a sister called Mary, you will address her--even though she\r\nshould be married--as Marya Ivanovna (pronounced Ivanna).\r\n\r\nImmediately on his arrival young Schmidt had set himself vigorously\r\nto reorganise the estate and improve the method of agriculture. Some\r\nploughs, harrows, and other implements which had been imported at a\r\nformer period were dragged out of the obscurity in which they had\r\nlain for several years, and an attempt was made to farm on scientific\r\nprinciples. The attempt was far from being completely successful, for\r\nthe serfs--this was before the Emancipation--could not be made to work\r\nlike regularly trained German labourers. In spite of all admonitions,\r\nthreats, and punishments, they persisted in working slowly, listlessly,\r\ninaccurately, and occasionally they broke the new instruments from\r\ncarelessness or some more culpable motive. Karl Karl\u0027itch was not\r\nnaturally a hard-hearted man, but he was very rigid in his notions of\r\nduty, and could be cruelly severe when his orders were not executed with\r\nan accuracy and punctuality that seemed to the Russian rustic mind mere\r\nuseless pedantry. The serfs did not offer him any open opposition, and\r\nwere always obsequiously respectful in their demeanour towards him, but\r\nthey invariably frustrated his plans by their carelessness and stolid,\r\npassive resistance.\r\n\r\nThus arose that silent conflict and that smouldering mutual enmity which\r\nalmost always result from the contact of the Teuton with the Slav. The\r\nserfs instinctively regretted the good old times, when they lived under\r\nthe rough-and-ready patriarchal rule of their masters, assisted by\r\na native \"burmister,\" or overseer, who was one of themselves. The\r\nburmister had not always been honest in his dealings with them, and\r\nthe master had often, when in anger, ordered severe punishments to be\r\ninflicted; but the burmister had not attempted to make them change their\r\nold habits, and had shut his eyes to many little sins of omission\r\nand commission, whilst the master was always ready to assist them in\r\ndifficulties, and commonly treated them in a kindly, familiar way. As\r\nthe old Russian proverb has it, \"Where danger is, there too is kindly\r\nforgiveness.\" Karl Karl\u0027itch, on the contrary, was the personification\r\nof uncompassionate, inflexible law. Blind rage and compassionate\r\nkindliness were alike foreign to his system of government. If he had\r\nany feeling towards the serfs, it was one of chronic contempt. The word\r\ndurak (blockhead) was constantly on his lips, and when any bit of work\r\nwas well done, he took it as a matter of course, and never thought of\r\ngiving a word of approval or encouragement.\r\n\r\nWhen it became evident, in 1859, that the emancipation of the serfs was\r\nat hand, Karl Karl\u0027itch confidently predicted that the country would\r\ninevitably go to ruin. He knew by experience that the peasants were lazy\r\nand improvident, even when they lived under the tutelage of a master,\r\nand with the fear of the rod before their eyes. What would they become\r\nwhen this guidance and salutary restraint should be removed? The\r\nprospect raised terrible forebodings in the mind of the worthy steward,\r\nwho had his employer\u0027s interests really at heart; and these forebodings\r\nwere considerably increased and intensified when he learned that\r\nthe peasants were to receive by law the land which they occupied on\r\nsufferance, and which comprised about a half of the whole arable land\r\nof the estate. This arrangement he declared to be a dangerous and\r\nunjustifiable infraction of the sacred rights of property, which\r\nsavoured strongly of communism, and could have but one practical result:\r\nthe emancipated peasants would live by the cultivation of their own\r\nland, and would not consent on any terms to work for their former\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nIn the few months which immediately followed the publication of the\r\nEmancipation Edict in 1861, Karl Karl\u0027itch found much to confirm his\r\nmost gloomy apprehensions. The peasants showed themselves dissatisfied\r\nwith the privileges conferred upon them, and sought to evade the\r\ncorresponding duties imposed on them by the new law. In vain he\r\nendeavoured, by exhortations, promises, and threats, to get the most\r\nnecessary part of the field-work done, and showed the peasants the\r\nprovision of the law enjoining them to obey and work as of old until\r\nsome new arrangement should be made. To all his appeals they replied\r\nthat, having been freed by the Tsar, they were no longer obliged to\r\nwork for their former master; and he was at last forced to appeal to\r\nthe authorities. This step had a certain effect, but the field-work was\r\nexecuted that year even worse than usual, and the harvest suffered in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nSince that time things had gradually improved. The peasants had\r\ndiscovered that they could not support themselves and pay their taxes\r\nfrom the land ceded to them, and had accordingly consented to till the\r\nproprietor\u0027s fields for a moderate recompense. \"These last two years,\"\r\nsaid Karl Karl\u0027itch to me, with an air of honest self-satisfaction, \"I\r\nhave been able, after paying all expenses, to transmit little sums to\r\nthe young master in St. Petersburg. It was certainly not much, but it\r\nshows that things are better than they were. Still, it is hard, uphill\r\nwork. The peasants have not been improved by liberty. They now work less\r\nand drink more than they did in the times of serfage, and if you say a\r\nword to them they\u0027ll go away, and not work for you at all.\" Here\r\nKarl Karl\u0027itch indemnified himself for his recent self-control in the\r\npresence of his workers by using a series of the strongest epithets\r\nwhich the combined languages of his native and of his adopted country\r\ncould supply. \"But laziness and drunkenness are not their only faults.\r\nThey let their cattle wander into our fields, and never lose an\r\nopportunity of stealing firewood from the forest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have now for such matters the rural justices of the peace,\" I\r\nventured to suggest.\r\n\r\n\"The justices of the peace!\" . . . Here Karl Karl\u0027itch used an inelegant\r\nexpression, which showed plainly that he was no unqualified admirer\r\nof the new judicial institutions. \"What is the use of applying to the\r\njustices? The nearest one lives six miles off, and when I go to him he\r\nevidently tries to make me lose as much time as possible. I am sure to\r\nlose nearly a whole day, and at the end of it I may find that I have got\r\nnothing for my pains. These justices always try to find some excuse for\r\nthe peasant, and when they do condemn, by way of exception, the\r\naffair does not end there. There is pretty sure to be a pettifogging\r\npractitioner prowling about--some rascally scribe who has been dismissed\r\nfrom the public offices for pilfering and extorting too openly--and he\r\nis always ready to whisper to the peasant that he should appeal. The\r\npeasant knows that the decision is just, but he is easily persuaded\r\nthat by appealing to the Monthly Sessions he gets another chance in\r\nthe lottery, and may perhaps draw a prize. He lets the rascally scribe,\r\ntherefore, prepare an appeal for him, and I receive an invitation to\r\nattend the Session of Justices in the district town on a certain day.\r\n\r\n\"It is a good five-and-thirty miles to the district town, as you know,\r\nbut I get up early, and arrive at eleven o\u0027clock, the hour stated in the\r\nofficial notice. A crowd of peasants are hanging about the door of the\r\ncourt, but the only official present is the porter. I enquire of him\r\nwhen my case is likely to come on, and receive the laconic answer, \u0027How\r\nshould I know?\u0027 After half an hour the secretary arrives. I repeat my\r\nquestion, and receive the same answer. Another half hour passes, and one\r\nof the justices drives up in his tarantass. Perhaps he is a glib-tongued\r\ngentleman, and assures me that the proceedings will commence at once:\r\n\u0027Sei tchas! sei tchas!\u0027 Don\u0027t believe what the priest or the dictionary\r\ntells you about the meaning of that expression. The dictionary will tell\r\nyou that it means \u0027immediately,\u0027 but that\u0027s all nonsense. In the mouth\r\nof a Russian it means \u0027in an hour,\u0027 \u0027next week,\u0027 \u0027in a year or two,\u0027\r\n\u0027never\u0027--most commonly \u0027never.\u0027 Like many other words in Russian, \u0027sei\r\ntchas\u0027 can be understood only after long experience. A second justice\r\ndrives up, and then a third. No more are required by law, but these\r\ngentlemen must first smoke several cigarettes and discuss all the local\r\nnews before they begin work.\r\n\r\n\"At last they take their seats on the bench--a slightly elevated\r\nplatform at one end of the room, behind a table covered with green\r\nbaize--and the proceedings commence. My case is sure to be pretty far\r\ndown on the list--the secretary takes, I believe, a malicious pleasure\r\nin watching my impatience--and before it is called the justices have to\r\nretire at least once for refreshments and cigarettes. I have to amuse\r\nmyself by listening to the other cases, and some of them, I can assure\r\nyou, are amusing enough. The walls of that room must be by this time\r\npretty well saturated with perjury, and many of the witnesses catch at\r\nonce the infection. Perhaps I may tell you some other time a few of the\r\namusing incidents that I have seen there. At last my case is called. It\r\nis as clear as daylight, but the rascally pettifogger is there with\r\na long-prepared speech, he holds in his hand a small volume of the\r\ncodified law, and quotes paragraphs which no amount of human ingenuity\r\ncan make to bear upon the subject. Perhaps the previous decision is\r\nconfirmed; perhaps it is reversed; in either case, I have lost a second\r\nday and exhausted more patience than I can conveniently spare. And\r\nsomething even worse may happen, as I know by experience. Once during\r\na case of mine there was some little informality--someone inadvertently\r\nopened the door of the consulting-room when the decision was being\r\nwritten, or some other little incident of the sort occurred, and the\r\nrascally pettifogger complained to the Supreme Court of Revision, which\r\nis a part of the Senate. The case was all about a few roubles, but it\r\nwas discussed in St. Petersburg, and afterwards tried over again by\r\nanother court of justices. Now I have paid my Lehrgeld, and go no more\r\nto law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must expose yourself to all kinds of extortion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much as you might imagine. I have my own way of dispensing\r\njustice. When I catch a peasant\u0027s horse or cow in our fields, I lock it\r\nup and make the owner pay a ransom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not rather dangerous,\" I inquired, \"to take the law thus into\r\nyour own hands? I have heard that the Russian justices are extremely\r\nsevere against any one who has recourse to what our German jurists call\r\nSelbsthulfe.\"\r\n\r\n\"That they are! So long as you are in Russia, you had much better let\r\nyourself be quietly robbed than use any violence against the robber. It\r\nis less trouble, and it is cheaper in the long run. If you do not, you\r\nmay unexpectedly find yourself some fine morning in prison! You must\r\nknow that many of the young justices belong to the new school of\r\nmorals.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that? I have not heard of any new discoveries lately in the\r\nsphere of speculative ethics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, I am not one of the initiated, and I can\r\nonly tell you what I hear. So far as I have noticed, the representatives\r\nof the new doctrine talk chiefly about Gumannost\u0027 and Tchelovetcheskoe\r\ndostoinstvo. You know what these words mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Humanity, or rather humanitarianism and human dignity,\" I replied, not\r\nsorry to give a proof that I was advancing in my studies.\r\n\r\n\"There, again, you allow your dictionary and your priest to mislead you.\r\nThese terms, when used by a Russian, cover much more than we understand\r\nby them, and those who use them most frequently have generally a special\r\ntenderness for all kinds of malefactors. In the old times, malefactors\r\nwere popularly believed to be bad, dangerous people; but it has been\r\nlately discovered that this is a delusion. A young proprietor who lives\r\nnot far off assures me that they are the true Protestants, and the\r\nmost powerful social reformers! They protest practically against those\r\nimperfections of social organisation of which they are the involuntary\r\nvictims. The feeble, characterless man quietly submits to his chains;\r\nthe bold, generous, strong man breaks his fetters, and helps others to\r\ndo the same. A very ingenious defence of all kinds of rascality, isn\u0027t\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is a theory that might certainly be carried too far, and might\r\neasily lead to very inconvenient conclusions; but I am not sure that,\r\ntheoretically speaking, it does not contain a certain element of truth.\r\nIt ought at least to foster that charity which we are enjoined to\r\npractise towards all men. But perhaps \u0027all men\u0027 does not include\r\npublicans and sinners?\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words Karl Karl\u0027itch turned to me, and every feature of\r\nhis honest German face expressed the most undisguised astonishment.\r\n\"Are you, too, a Nihilist?\" he inquired, as soon as he had partially\r\nrecovered his breath.\r\n\r\n\"I really don\u0027t know what a Nihilist is, but I may assure you that I am\r\nnot an \u0027ist\u0027 of any kind. What is a Nihilist?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you live long in Russia you\u0027ll learn that without my telling you.\r\nAs I was saying, I am not at all afraid of the peasants citing me before\r\nthe justice. They know better now. If they gave me too much trouble I\r\ncould starve their cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, when you catch them in your fields,\" I remarked, taking no notice\r\nof the abrupt turn which he had given to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I can do it without that. You must know that, by the Emancipation\r\nLaw, the peasants received arable land, but they received little or no\r\npasturage. I have the whip hand of them there!\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks of Karl Karl\u0027itch on men and things were to me always\r\ninteresting, for he was a shrewd observer, and displayed occasionally a\r\npleasant, dry humour. But I very soon discovered that his opinions were\r\nnot to be accepted without reserve. His strong, inflexible Teutonic\r\nnature often prevented him from judging impartially. He had no sympathy\r\nwith the men and the institutions around him, and consequently he was\r\nunable to see things from the inside. The specks and blemishes on the\r\nsurface he perceived clearly enough, but he had no knowledge of the\r\nsecret, deep-rooted causes by which these specks and blemishes were\r\nproduced. The simple fact that a man was a Russian satisfactorily\r\naccounted, in his opinion, for any kind of moral deformity; and his\r\nknowledge turned out to be by no means so extensive as I had at first\r\nsupposed. Though he had been many years in the country, he knew very\r\nlittle about the life of the peasants beyond that small part of it which\r\nconcerned directly his own interests and those of his employer. Of the\r\ncommunal organisation, domestic life, religious beliefs, ceremonial\r\npractices, and nomadic habits of his humble neighbours, he knew little,\r\nand the little he happened to know was far from accurate. In order to\r\ngain a knowledge of these matters it would be better, I perceived, to\r\nconsult the priest, or, better still, the peasants themselves. But to do\r\nthis it would be necessary to understand easily and speak fluently the\r\ncolloquial language, and I was still very far from having, acquired the\r\nrequisite proficiency.\r\n\r\nEven for one who possesses a natural facility for acquiring foreign\r\ntongues, the learning of Russian is by no means an easy task. Though\r\nit is essentially an Aryan language like our own, and contains only a\r\nslight intermixture of Tartar words,--such as bashlyk (a hood), kalpak\r\n(a night-cap), arbuz (a water-melon), etc.--it has certain sounds\r\nunknown to West-European ears, and difficult for West-European tongues,\r\nand its roots, though in great part derived from the same original stock\r\nas those of the Graeco-Latin and Teutonic languages, are generally not\r\nat all easily recognised. As an illustration of this, take the Russian\r\nword otets. Strange as it may at first sight appear, this word is merely\r\nanother form of our word father, of the German vater, and of the French\r\npere. The syllable ets is the ordinary Russian termination denoting the\r\nagent, corresponding to the English and German ending er, as we see in\r\nsuch words as--kup-ets (a buyer), plov-ets (a swimmer), and many others.\r\nThe root ot is a mutilated form of vot, as we see in the word otchina (a\r\npaternal inheritance), which is frequently written votchina. Now vot is\r\nevidently the same root as the German vat in Vater, and the English fath\r\nin father. Quod erat demonstrandum.\r\n\r\nAll this is simple enough, and goes to prove the fundamental identity,\r\nor rather the community of origin, of the Slav and Teutonic languages;\r\nbut it will be readily understood that etymological analogies so\r\ncarefully disguised are of little practical use in helping us to acquire\r\na foreign tongue. Besides this, the grammatical forms and constructions\r\nin Russian are very peculiar, and present a great many strange\r\nirregularities. As an illustration of this we may take the future tense.\r\nThe Russian verb has commonly a simple and a frequentative future. The\r\nlatter is always regularly formed by means of an auxiliary with the\r\ninfinitive, as in English, but the former is constructed in a variety of\r\nways, for which no rule can be given, so that the simple future of each\r\nindividual verb must be learned by a pure effort of memory. In many\r\nverbs it is formed by prefixing a preposition, but it is impossible\r\nto determine by rule which preposition should be used. Thus idu (I go)\r\nbecomes poidu; pishu (I write) becomes napishu; pyu (I drink) becomes\r\nvuipyu, and so on.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to the difficulties of pronunciation is the difficulty of\r\naccentuating the proper syllable. In this respect Russian is like Greek;\r\nyou can rarely tell a priori on what syllable the accent falls. But\r\nit is more puzzling than Greek, for two reasons: firstly, it is not\r\ncustomary to print Russian with accents; and secondly, no one has yet\r\nbeen able to lay down precise rules for the transposition of the accent\r\nin the various inflections of the same word, Of this latter peculiarity,\r\nlet one illustration suffice. The word ruka (hand) has the accent on the\r\nlast syllable, but in the accusative (ruku) the accent goes back to the\r\nfirst syllable. It must not, however, be assumed that in all words\r\nof this type a similar transposition takes place. The word beda\r\n(misfortune), for instance, as well as very many others, always retains\r\nthe accent on the last syllable.\r\n\r\nThese and many similar difficulties, which need not be here enumerated,\r\ncan be mastered only by long practice. Serious as they are, they need\r\nnot frighten any one who is in the habit of learning foreign tongues.\r\nThe ear and the tongue gradually become familiar with the peculiarities\r\nof inflection and accentuation, and practice fulfils the same function\r\nas abstract rules.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed that Russians have been endowed by Nature with\r\na peculiar linguistic talent. Their own language, it is said, is so\r\ndifficult that they have no difficulty in acquiring others. This common\r\nbelief requires, as it seems to me, some explanation. That highly\r\neducated Russians are better linguists than the educated classes of\r\nWestern Europe there can be no possible doubt, for they almost always\r\nspeak French, and often English and German also. The question, however,\r\nis whether this is the result of a psychological peculiarity, or of\r\nother causes. Now, without venturing to deny the existence of a natural\r\nfaculty, I should say that the other causes have at least exercised a\r\npowerful influence. Any Russian who wishes to be regarded as civilised\r\nmust possess at least one foreign language; and, as a consequence of\r\nthis, the children of the upper classes are always taught at least\r\nFrench in their infancy. Many households comprise a German nurse, a\r\nFrench tutor, and an English governess; and the children thus become\r\naccustomed from their earliest years to the use of these three\r\nlanguages. Besides this, Russian is phonetically very rich and contains\r\nnearly all the sounds which are to be found in West-European tongues.\r\nPerhaps on the whole it would be well to apply here the Darwinian\r\ntheory, and suppose that the Russian Noblesse, having been obliged\r\nfor several generations to acquire foreign languages, have gradually\r\ndeveloped a hereditary polyglot talent.\r\n\r\nSeveral circumstances concurred to assist me in my efforts, during my\r\nvoluntary exile, to acquire at least such a knowledge of the language\r\nas would enable me to converse freely with the peasantry. In the first\r\nplace, my reverend teacher was an agreeable, kindly, talkative man,\r\nwho took a great delight in telling interminable stories, quite\r\nindependently of any satisfaction which he might derive from the\r\nconsciousness of their being understood and appreciated. Even when\r\nwalking alone he was always muttering something to an imaginary\r\nlistener. A stranger meeting him on such occasions might have supposed\r\nthat he was holding converse with unseen spirits, though his broad\r\nmuscular form and rubicund face militated strongly against such a\r\nsupposition; but no man, woman, or child living within a radius of\r\nten miles would ever have fallen into this mistake. Every one in the\r\nneighbourhood knew that \"Batushka\" (papa), as he was familiarly called,\r\nwas too prosaical, practical a man to see things ethereal, that he was\r\nan irrepressible talker, and that when he could not conveniently find an\r\naudience he created one by his own imagination. This peculiarity of his\r\nrendered me good service. Though for some time I understood very little\r\nof what he said, and very often misplaced the positive and negative\r\nmonosyllables which I hazarded occasionally by way of encouragement,\r\nhe talked vigorously all the same. Like all garrulous people, he was\r\nconstantly repeating himself; but to this I did not object, for the\r\ncustom--however disagreeable in ordinary society--was for me highly\r\nbeneficial, and when I had already heard a story once or twice before,\r\nit was much easier for me to assume at the proper moment the requisite\r\nexpression of countenance.\r\n\r\nAnother fortunate circumstance was that at Ivanofka there were no\r\ndistractions, so that the whole of the day and a great part of the night\r\ncould be devoted to study. My chief amusement was an occasional walk in\r\nthe fields with Karl Karl\u0027itch; and even this mild form of dissipation\r\ncould not always be obtained, for as soon as rain had fallen it was\r\ndifficult to go beyond the verandah--the mud precluding the\r\npossibility of a constitutional. The nearest approach to excitement was\r\nmushroom-gathering; and in this occupation my inability to distinguish\r\nthe edible from the poisonous species made my efforts unacceptable. We\r\nlived so \"far from the madding crowd\" that its din scarcely reached\r\nour ears. A week or ten days might pass without our receiving any\r\nintelligence from the outer world. The nearest post-office was in the\r\ndistrict town, and with that distant point we had no regular system of\r\ncommunication. Letters and newspapers remained there till called for,\r\nand were brought to us intermittently when some one of our neighbours\r\nhappened to pass that way. Current history was thus administered to us\r\nin big doses.\r\n\r\nOne very big dose I remember well. For a much longer time than usual\r\nno volunteer letter-carrier had appeared, and the delay was more than\r\nusually tantalising, because it was known that war had broken out\r\nbetween France and Germany. At last a big bundle of a daily paper called\r\nthe Golos was brought to me. Impatient to learn whether any great battle\r\nhad been fought, I began by examining the latest number, and stumbled\r\nat once on an article headed, \"Latest Intelligence: the Emperor at\r\nWilhelmshohe!!!\" The large type in which the heading was printed and\r\nthe three marks of exclamation showed plainly that the article was very\r\nimportant. I began to read with avidity, but was utterly mystified. What\r\nemperor was this? Probably the Tsar or the Emperor of Austria, for\r\nthere was no German Emperor in those days. But no! It was evidently the\r\nEmperor of the French. And how did Napoleon get to Wilhelmshohe? The\r\nFrench must have broken through the Rhine defences, and pushed far\r\ninto Germany. But no! As I read further, I found this theory equally\r\nuntenable. It turned out that the Emperor was surrounded by Germans,\r\nand--a prisoner! In order to solve the mystery, I had to go back to the\r\npreceding numbers of the paper, and learned, at a sitting, all about the\r\nsuccessive German victories, the defeat and capitulation of Macmahon\u0027s\r\narmy at Sedan, and the other great events of that momentous time. The\r\nimpression produced can scarcely be realised by those who have always\r\nimbibed current history in the homeopathic doses administered by the\r\nmorning and evening daily papers.\r\n\r\nBy the useful loquacity of my teacher and the possibility of devoting\r\nall my time to my linguistic studies, I made such rapid progress in\r\nthe acquisition of the language that I was able after a few weeks to\r\nunderstand much of what was said to me, and to express myself in a\r\nvague, roundabout way. In the latter operation I was much assisted by\r\na peculiar faculty of divination which the Russians possess in a high\r\ndegree. If a foreigner succeeds in expressing about one-fourth of\r\nan idea, the Russian peasant can generally fill up the remaining\r\nthree-fourths from his own intuition.\r\n\r\nAs my powers of comprehension increased, my long conversations with\r\nthe priest became more and more instructive. At first his remarks and\r\nstories had for me simply a philological interest, but gradually\r\nI perceived that his talk contained a great deal of solid,\r\ncurious information regarding himself and the class to which he\r\nbelonged--information of a kind not commonly found in grammatical\r\nexercises. Some of this I now propose to communicate to the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE PRIEST\r\n\r\n\r\nPriests\u0027 Names--Clerical Marriages--The White and the Black Clergy--Why\r\nthe People do not Respect the Parish Priests--History of the White\r\nClergy--The Parish Priest and the Protestant Pastor--In What Sense\r\nthe Russian People are Religious--Icons--The Clergy and Popular\r\nEducation--Ecclesiastical Reform--Premonitory Symptoms of Change--Two\r\nTypical Specimens of the Parochial Clergy of the Present Day.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn formal introductions it is customary to pronounce in a more or less\r\ninaudible voice the names of the two persons introduced. Circumstances\r\ncompel me in the present case to depart from received custom. The truth\r\nis, I do not know the names of the two people whom I wish to bring\r\ntogether! The reader who knows his own name will readily pardon one-half\r\nof my ignorance, but he may naturally expect that I should know the name\r\nof a man with whom I profess to be acquainted, and with whom I daily\r\nheld long conversations during a period of several months. Strange as\r\nit may seem, I do not. During all the time of my sojourn in Ivanofka I\r\nnever heard him addressed or spoken of otherwise than as \"Batushka.\" Now\r\n\"Batushka\" is not a name at all. It is simply the diminutive form of an\r\nobsolete word meaning \"father,\" and is usually applied to all village\r\npriests. The ushka is a common diminutive termination, and the root Bat\r\nis evidently the same as that which appears in the Latin pater.\r\n\r\nThough I do not happen to know what Batushka\u0027s family name was, I can\r\ncommunicate two curious facts concerning it: he had not possessed it in\r\nhis childhood, and it was not the same as his father\u0027s.\r\n\r\nThe reader whose intuitive powers have been preternaturally sharpened by\r\na long course of sensation novels will probably leap to the conclusion\r\nthat Batushka was a mysterious individual, very different from what he\r\nseemed--either the illegitimate son of some great personage, or a man of\r\nhigh birth who had committed some great sin, and who now sought oblivion\r\nand expiation in the humble duties of a parish priest. Let me dispel\r\nat once all delusions of this kind. Batushka was actually as well as\r\nlegally the legitimate son of an ordinary parish priest, who was\r\nstill living, about twenty miles off, and for many generations all his\r\npaternal and maternal ancestors, male and female, had belonged to the\r\npriestly caste. He was thus a Levite of the purest water, and thoroughly\r\nLevitical in his character. Though he knew by experience something about\r\nthe weakness of the flesh, he had never committed any sins of the heroic\r\nkind, and had no reason to conceal his origin. The curious facts above\r\nstated were simply the result of a peculiar custom which exists among\r\nthe Russian clergy. According to this custom, when a boy enters the\r\nseminary he receives from the Bishop a new family name. The name may be\r\nBogoslafski, from a word signifying \"Theology,\" or Bogolubof, \"the love\r\nof God,\" or some similar term; or it may be derived from the name of the\r\nboy\u0027s native village, or from any other word which the Bishop thinks fit\r\nto choose. I know of one instance where a Bishop chose two French words\r\nfor the purpose. He had intended to call the boy Velikoselski, after his\r\nnative place, Velikoe Selo, which means \"big village\"; but finding\r\nthat there was already a Velikoselski in the seminary, and being in a\r\nfacetious frame of mind, he called the new comer Grandvillageski--a word\r\nthat may perhaps sorely puzzle some philologist of the future.\r\n\r\nMy reverend teacher was a tall, muscular man of about forty years of\r\nage, with a full dark-brown beard, and long lank hair falling over his\r\nshoulders. The visible parts of his dress consisted of three articles--a\r\ndingy-brown robe of coarse material buttoned closely at the neck and\r\ndescending to the ground, a wideawake hat, and a pair of large, heavy\r\nboots. As to the esoteric parts of his attire, I refrained from making\r\ninvestigations. His life had been an uneventful one. At an early age he\r\nhad been sent to the seminary in the chief town of the province, and had\r\nmade for himself the reputation of a good average scholar. \"The seminary\r\nof that time,\" he used to say to me, referring to that part of his\r\nlife, \"was not what it is now. Nowadays the teachers talk about\r\nhumanitarianism, and the boys would think that a crime had been\r\ncommitted against human dignity if one of them happened to be flogged.\r\nBut they don\u0027t consider that human dignity is at all affected by their\r\ngetting drunk, and going to--to--to places that I never went to. I was\r\nflogged often enough, and I don\u0027t think that I am a worse man on that\r\naccount; and though I never heard then anything about pedagogical\r\nscience that they talk so much about now, I\u0027ll read a bit of Latin yet\r\nwith the best of them.\r\n\r\n\"When my studies were finished,\" said Batushka, continuing the simple\r\nstory of his life, \"the Bishop found a wife for me, and I succeeded\r\nher father, who was then an old man. In that way I became a priest of\r\nIvanofka, and have remained here ever since. It is a hard life, for the\r\nparish is big, and my bit of land is not very fertile; but, praise be to\r\nGod! I am healthy and strong, and get on well enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"You said that the Bishop found a wife for you,\" I remarked. \"I suppose,\r\ntherefore, that he was a great friend of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The Bishop does the same for all the seminarists who wish\r\nto be ordained: it is an important part of his pastoral duties.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" I exclaimed in astonishment. \"Surely that is carrying the\r\nsystem of paternal government a little too far. Why should his Reverence\r\nmeddle with things that don\u0027t concern him?\"\r\n\r\n\"But these matters do concern him. He is the natural protector of widows\r\nand orphans, especially among the clergy of his own diocese. When a\r\nparish priest dies, what is to become of his wife and daughters?\"\r\n\r\nNot perceiving clearly the exact bearing of these last remarks, I\r\nventured to suggest that priests ought to economise in view of future\r\ncontingencies.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to speak,\" replied Batushka: \"\u0027A story is soon told,\u0027 as\r\nthe old proverb has it, \u0027but a thing is not soon done.\u0027 How are we to\r\neconomise? Even without saving we have the greatest difficulty to make\r\nthe two ends meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the widow and daughters might work and gain a livelihood.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, pray, could they work at?\" asked Batushka, and paused for a\r\nreply. Seeing that I had none to offer him, he continued, \"Even the\r\nhouse and land belong not to them, but to the new priest.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that position occurred in a novel,\" I said, \"I could foretell what\r\nwould happen. The author would make the new priest fall in love with\r\nand marry one of the daughters, and then the whole family, including the\r\nmother-in-law, would live happily ever afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly how the Bishop arranges the matter. What the novelist\r\ndoes with the puppets of his imagination, the Bishop does with real\r\nbeings of flesh and blood. As a rational being he cannot leave things\r\nto chance. Besides this, he must arrange the matter before the young man\r\ntakes orders, because, by the rules of the Church, the marriage cannot\r\ntake place after the ceremony of ordination. When the affair is arranged\r\nbefore the charge becomes vacant, the old priest can die with the\r\npleasant consciousness that his family is provided for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Batushka, you certainly put the matter in a very plausible way,\r\nbut there seem to be two flaws in the analogy. The novelist can make two\r\npeople fall in love with each other, and make them live happily together\r\nwith the mother-in-law, but that--with all due respect to his Reverence,\r\nbe it said--is beyond the power of a Bishop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure,\" said Batushka, avoiding the point of the objection,\r\n\"that love-marriages are always the happiest ones; and as to the\r\nmother-in-law, there are--or at least there were until the emancipation\r\nof the serfs--a mother-in-law and several daughters-in-law in almost\r\nevery peasant household.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does harmony generally reign in peasant households?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon the head of the house. If he is a man of the right\r\nsort, he can keep the women-folks in order.\" This remark was made in\r\nan energetic tone, with the evident intention of assuring me that the\r\nspeaker was himself \"a man of the right sort\"; but I did not attribute\r\nmuch importance to it, for I have occasionally heard henpecked husbands\r\ntalk in this grandiloquent way when their wives were out of hearing.\r\nAltogether I was by no means convinced that the system of providing for\r\nthe widows and orphans of the clergy by means of mariages de convenance\r\nwas a good one, but I determined to suspend my judgment until I should\r\nobtain fuller information.\r\n\r\nAn additional bit of evidence came to me a week or two later. One\r\nmorning, on going into the priest\u0027s house, I found that he had a friend\r\nwith him--the priest of a village some fifteen miles off. Before we had\r\ngot through the ordinary conventional remarks about the weather and the\r\ncrops, a peasant drove up to the door in his cart with a message that\r\nan old peasant was dying in a neighbouring village, and desired the last\r\nconsolations of religion. Batushka was thus obliged to leave us, and his\r\nfriend and I agreed to stroll leisurely in the direction of the village\r\nto which he was going, so as to meet him on his way home. The harvest\r\nwas already finished, so that our road, after emerging from the village,\r\nlay through stubble-fields. Beyond this we entered the pine forest, and\r\nby the time we had reached this point I had succeeded in leading the\r\nconversation to the subject of clerical marriages.\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking a good deal on this subject,\" I said, \"and I\r\nshould very much like to know your opinion about the system.\"\r\n\r\nMy new acquaintance was a tall, lean, black-haired man, with a sallow\r\ncomplexion and vinegar aspect--evidently one of those unhappy mortals\r\nwho are intended by Nature to take a pessimistic view of all things, and\r\nto point out to their fellows the deep shadows of human life. I was not\r\nat all surprised, therefore, when he replied in a deep, decided tone,\r\n\"Bad, very bad--utterly bad!\"\r\n\r\nThe way in which these words were pronounced left no doubt as to the\r\nopinion of the speaker, but I was desirous of knowing on what that\r\nopinion was founded--more especially as I seemed to detect in the tone a\r\nnote of personal grievance. My answer was shaped accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"I suspected that; but in the discussions which I have had I have always\r\nbeen placed at a disadvantage, not being able to adduce any definite\r\nfacts in support of my opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may congratulate yourself on being unable to find any in your own\r\nexperience. A mother-in-law living in the house does not conduce to\r\ndomestic harmony. I don\u0027t know how it is in your country, but so it is\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\nI hastened to assure him that this was not a peculiarity of Russia.\r\n\r\n\"I know it only too well,\" he continued. \"My mother-in-law lived with\r\nme for some years, and I was obliged at last to insist on her going to\r\nanother son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather selfish conduct towards your brother-in-law,\" I said to myself,\r\nand then added audibly, \"I hope you have thus solved the difficulty\r\nsatisfactorily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. Things are worse now than they were. I agreed to pay her\r\nthree roubles a month, and have regularly fulfilled my promise, but\r\nlately she has thought it not enough, and she made a complaint to the\r\nBishop. Last week I went to him to defend myself, but as I had not money\r\nenough for all the officials in the Consistorium, I could not obtain\r\njustice. My mother-in-law had made all sorts of absurd accusations\r\nagainst me, and consequently I was laid under an inhibition for six\r\nweeks!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the effect of an inhibition?\"\r\n\r\n\"The effect is that I cannot perform the ordinary rites of our religion.\r\nIt is really very unjust,\" he added, assuming an indignant tone, \"and\r\nvery annoying. Think of all the hardship and inconvenience to which it\r\ngives rise.\"\r\n\r\nAs I thought of the hardship and inconvenience to which the parishioners\r\nmust be exposed through the inconsiderate conduct of the old\r\nmother-in-law, I could not but sympathise with my new acquaintance\u0027s\r\nindignation. My sympathy was, however, somewhat cooled when I perceived\r\nthat I was on a wrong tack, and that the priest was looking at the\r\nmatter from an entirely different point of view.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, \"it is a most unfortunate time of year. The peasants\r\nhave gathered in their harvest, and can give of their abundance.\r\nThere are merry-makings and marriages, besides the ordinary deaths\r\nand baptisms. Altogether I shall lose by the thing more than a hundred\r\nroubles!\"\r\n\r\nI confess I was a little shocked on hearing the priest thus speak of his\r\nsacred functions as if they were an ordinary marketable commodity, and\r\ntalk of the inhibition as a pushing undertaker might talk of sanitary\r\nimprovements. My surprise was caused not by the fact that he regarded\r\nthe matter from a pecuniary point of view--for I was old enough to know\r\nthat clerical human nature is not altogether insensible to pecuniary\r\nconsiderations--but by the fact that he should thus undisguisedly\r\nexpress his opinions to a stranger without in the least suspecting\r\nthat there was anything unseemly in his way of speaking. The incident\r\nappeared to me very characteristic, but I refrained from all audible\r\ncomments, lest I should inadvertently check his communicativeness. With\r\nthe view of encouraging it, I professed to be very much interested, as\r\nI really was, in what he said, and I asked him how in his opinion the\r\npresent unsatisfactory state of things might be remedied.\r\n\r\n\"There is but one cure,\" he said, with a readiness that showed he had\r\noften spoken on the theme already, \"and that is freedom and publicity.\r\nWe full-grown men are treated like children, and watched like\r\nconspirators. If I wish to preach a sermon--not that I often wish to\r\ndo such a thing, but there are occasions when it is advisable--I am\r\nexpected to show it first to the Blagotchinny, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, who is the Blagotchinny?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Blagotchinny is a parish priest who is in direct relations with\r\nthe Consistory of the Province, and who is supposed to exercise a strict\r\nsupervision over all the other parish priests of his district. He acts\r\nas the spy of the Consistory, which is filled with greedy, shameless\r\nofficials, deaf to any one who does not come provided with a handful of\r\nroubles. The Bishop may be a good, well-intentioned man, but he always\r\nsees and acts through these worthless subordinates. Besides this, the\r\nBishops and heads of monasteries, who monopolise the higher places in\r\nthe ecclesiastical Administration, all belong to the Black Clergy--that\r\nis to say, they are all monks--and consequently cannot understand our\r\nwants. How can they, on whom celibacy is imposed by the rules of the\r\nChurch, understand the position of a parish priest who has to bring up\r\na family and to struggle with domestic cares of every kind? What they do\r\nis to take all the comfortable places for themselves, and leave us all\r\nthe hard work. The monasteries are rich enough, and you see how poor we\r\nare. Perhaps you have heard that the parish priests extort money from\r\nthe peasants--refusing to perform the rites of baptism or burial until\r\na considerable sum has been paid. It is only too true, but who is to\r\nblame? The priest must live and bring up his family, and you cannot\r\nimagine the humiliations to which he has to submit in order to gain a\r\nscanty pittance. I know it by experience. When I make the periodical\r\nvisitation I can see that the peasants grudge every handful of rye and\r\nevery egg that they give me. I can overbear their sneers as I go away,\r\nand I know they have many sayings such as--\u0027The priest takes from the\r\nliving and from the dead.\u0027 Many of them fasten their doors, pretending\r\nto be away from home, and do not even take the precaution of keeping\r\nsilent till I am out of hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surprise me,\" I said, in reply to the last part of this long\r\ntirade; \"I have always heard that the Russians are a very religious\r\npeople--at least the lower classes.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they are; but the peasantry are poor and heavily taxed. They set\r\ngreat importance on the sacraments, and observe rigorously the fasts,\r\nwhich comprise nearly a half of the year; but they show very little\r\nrespect for their priests, who are almost as poor as themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not see clearly how you propose to remedy this state of\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\n\"By freedom and publicity, as I said before.\" The worthy man seemed to\r\nhave learned this formula by rote. \"First of all, our wants must be made\r\nknown. In some provinces there have been attempts to do this by means of\r\nprovincial assemblies of the clergy, but these efforts have always been\r\nstrenuously opposed by the Consistories, whose members fear publicity\r\nabove all things. But in order to have publicity we must have more\r\nfreedom.\"\r\n\r\nHere followed a long discourse on freedom and publicity, which seemed to\r\nme very confused. So far as I could understand the argument, there was\r\na good deal of reasoning in a circle. Freedom was necessary in order to\r\nget publicity, and publicity was necessary in order to get freedom;\r\nand the practical result would be that the clergy would enjoy bigger\r\nsalaries and more popular respect. We had only got thus far in the\r\ninvestigation of the subject when our conversation was interrupted by\r\nthe rumbling of a peasant\u0027s cart. In a few seconds our friend Batushka\r\nappeared, and the conversation took a different turn.\r\n\r\nSince that time I have frequently spoken on this subject with competent\r\nauthorities, and nearly all have admitted that the present condition of\r\nthe clergy is highly unsatisfactory, and that the parish priest rarely\r\nenjoys the respect of his parishioners. In a semi-official report,\r\nwhich I once accidentally stumbled upon when searching for material of\r\na different kind, the facts are stated in the following plain language:\r\n\"The people\"--I seek to translate as literally as possible--\"do not\r\nrespect the clergy, but persecute them with derision and reproaches, and\r\nfeel them to be a burden. In nearly all the popular comic stories the\r\npriest, his wife, or his labourer is held up to ridicule, and in all the\r\nproverbs and popular sayings where the clergy are mentioned it is always\r\nwith derision. The people shun the clergy, and have recourse to them not\r\nfrom the inner impulse of conscience, but from necessity. . . . And why\r\ndo the people not respect the clergy? Because it forms a class apart;\r\nbecause, having received a false kind of education, it does not\r\nintroduce into the life of the people the teaching of the Spirit, but\r\nremains in the mere dead forms of outward ceremonial, at the same time\r\ndespising these forms even to blasphemy; because the clergy itself\r\ncontinually presents examples of want of respect to religion, and\r\ntransforms the service of God into a profitable trade. Can the people\r\nrespect the clergy when they hear how one priest stole money from below\r\nthe pillow of a dying man at the moment of confession, how another was\r\npublicly dragged out of a house of ill-fame, how a third christened a\r\ndog, how a fourth whilst officiating at the Easter service was dragged\r\nby the hair from the altar by the deacon? Is it possible for the\r\npeople to respect priests who spend their time in the gin-shop, write\r\nfraudulent petitions, fight with the cross in their hands, and abuse\r\neach other in bad language at the altar?\r\n\r\n\"One might fill several pages with examples of this kind--in each\r\ninstance naming the time and place--without overstepping the boundaries\r\nof the province of Nizhni-Novgorod. Is it possible for the people\r\nto respect the clergy when they see everywhere amongst them simony,\r\ncarelessness in performing the religious rites, and disorder in\r\nadministering the sacraments? Is it possible for the people to respect\r\nthe clergy when they see that truth has disappeared from it, and\r\nthat the Consistories, guided in their decisions not by rules, but\r\nby personal friendship and bribery, destroy in it the last remains of\r\ntruthfulness? If we add to all this the false certificates which the\r\nclergy give to those who do not wish to partake of the Eucharist, the\r\ndues illegally extracted from the Old Ritualists, the conversion of\r\nthe altar into a source of revenue, the giving of churches to priests\u0027\r\ndaughters as a dowry, and similar phenomena, the question as to whether\r\nthe people can respect the clergy requires no answer.\"\r\n\r\nAs these words were written by an orthodox Russian,* celebrated for his\r\nextensive and intimate knowledge of Russian provincial life, and were\r\naddressed in all seriousness to a member of the Imperial family, we\r\nmay safely assume that they contain a considerable amount of truth. The\r\nreader must not, however, imagine that all Russian priests are of\r\nthe kind above referred to. Many of them are honest, respectable,\r\nwell-intentioned men, who conscientiously fulfil their humble duties,\r\nand strive hard to procure a good education for their children. If they\r\nhave less learning, culture, and refinement than the Roman Catholic\r\npriesthood, they have at the same time infinitely less fanaticism, less\r\nspiritual pride, and less intolerance towards the adherents of other\r\nfaiths.\r\n\r\n     * Mr. Melnikof, in a \"secret\" Report to the Grand Duke\r\n     Constantine Nikolaievitch.\r\n\r\nBoth the good and the bad qualities of the Russian priesthood at the\r\npresent time can be easily explained by its past history, and by certain\r\npeculiarities of the national character.\r\n\r\nThe Russian White Clergy--that is to say, the parish priests, as\r\ndistinguished from the monks, who are called the Black Clergy--have had\r\na curious history. In primitive times they were drawn from all classes\r\nof the population, and freely elected by the parishioners. When a man\r\nwas elected by the popular vote, he was presented to the Bishop, and\r\nif he was found to be a fit and proper person for the office, he was\r\nat once ordained. But this custom early fell into disuse. The Bishops,\r\nfinding that many of the candidates presented were illiterate peasants,\r\ngradually assumed the right of appointing the priests, with or without\r\nthe consent of the parishioners; and their choice generally fell on the\r\nsons of the clergy as the men best fitted to take orders. The creation\r\nof Bishops\u0027 schools, afterwards called seminaries, in which the sons of\r\nthe clergy were educated, naturally led, in the course of time, to the\r\ntotal exclusion of the other classes. The policy of the civil Government\r\nled to the same end. Peter the Great laid down the principle that every\r\nsubject should in some way serve the State--the nobles as officers in\r\nthe army or navy, or as officials in the civil service; the clergy as\r\nministers of religion; and the lower classes as soldiers, sailors, or\r\ntax-payers. Of these three classes the clergy had by far the lightest\r\nburdens, and consequently many nobles and peasants would willingly have\r\nentered its ranks. But this species of desertion the Government could\r\nnot tolerate, and accordingly the priesthood was surrounded by a legal\r\nbarrier which prevented all outsiders from entering it. Thus by the\r\ncombined efforts of the ecclesiastical and the civil Administration the\r\nclergy became a separate class or caste, legally and actually incapable\r\nof mingling with the other classes of the population.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact that the clergy became an exclusive caste, with a\r\npeculiar character, peculiar habits, and peculiar ideals, would in\r\nitself have had a prejudicial influence on the priesthood; but this\r\nwas not all. The caste increased in numbers by the process of natural\r\nreproduction much more rapidly than the offices to be filled, so that\r\nthe supply of priests and deacons soon far exceeded the demand; and the\r\ndisproportion between supply and demand became every year greater and\r\ngreater. In this way was formed an ever-increasing clerical Proletariat,\r\nwhich--as is always the case with a Proletariat of any kind--gravitated\r\ntowards the towns. In vain the Government issued ukazes prohibiting the\r\npriests from quitting their places of domicile, and treated as vagrants\r\nand runaways those who disregarded the prohibition; in vain successive\r\nsovereigns endeavoured to diminish the number of these supernumeraries\r\nby drafting them wholesale into the army. In Moscow, St. Petersburg, and\r\nall the larger towns the cry was, \"Still they come!\" Every morning, in\r\nthe Kremlin of Moscow, a large crowd of them assembled for the purpose\r\nof being hired to officiate in the private chapels of the rich nobles,\r\nand a great deal of hard bargaining took place between the priests and\r\nthe lackeys sent to hire them--conducted in the same spirit, and in\r\nnearly the same forms, as that which simultaneously took place in the\r\nbazaar close by between extortionate traders and thrifty housewives.\r\n\"Listen to me,\" a priest would say, as an ultimatum, to a lackey who was\r\ntrying to beat down the price: \"if you don\u0027t give me seventy-five kopeks\r\nwithout further ado, I\u0027ll take a bite of this roll, and that will be\r\nan end to it!\" And that would have been an end to the bargaining, for,\r\naccording to the rules of the Church, a priest cannot officiate after\r\nbreaking his fast. The ultimatum, however, could be used with effect\r\nonly to country servants who had recently come to town. A sharp lackey,\r\nexperienced in this kind of diplomacy, would have laughed at the threat,\r\nand replied coolly, \"Bite away, Batushka; I can find plenty more of your\r\nsort!\" Amusing scenes of this kind I have heard described by old people\r\nwho professed to have been eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the priests who remained in the villages was not much\r\nbetter. Those of them who were fortunate enough to find places were\r\nraised at least above the fear of absolute destitution, but their\r\nposition was by no means enviable. They received little consideration\r\nor respect from the peasantry, and still less from the nobles. When the\r\nchurch was situated not on the State Domains, but on a private estate,\r\nthey were practically under the power of the proprietor--almost as\r\ncompletely as his serfs; and sometimes that power was exercised in a\r\nmost humiliating and shameful way. I have heard, for instance, of one\r\npriest who was ducked in a pond on a cold winter day for the amusement\r\nof the proprietor and his guests--choice spirits, of rough, jovial\r\ntemperament; and of another who, having neglected to take off his hat as\r\nhe passed the proprietor\u0027s house, was put into a barrel and rolled down\r\na hill into the river at the bottom!\r\n\r\nIn citing these incidents, I do not at all mean to imply that they\r\nrepresent the relations which usually existed between proprietors and\r\nvillage priests, for I am quite aware that wanton cruelty was not among\r\nthe ordinary vices of Russian serf-owners. My object in mentioning the\r\nincidents is to show how a brutal proprietor--and it must be admitted\r\nthat they were not a few brutal individuals in the class--could maltreat\r\na priest without much danger of being called to account for his conduct.\r\nOf course such conduct was an offence in the eyes of the criminal law;\r\nbut the criminal law of that time was very shortsighted, and strongly\r\ndisposed to close its eyes completely when the offender was an\r\ninfluential proprietor. Had the incidents reached the ears of the\r\nEmperor Nicholas he would probably have ordered the culprit to be\r\nsummarily and severely punished but, as the Russian proverb has it,\r\n\"Heaven is high, and the Tsar is far off.\" A village priest treated in\r\nthis barbarous way could have little hope of redress, and, if he were\r\na prudent man, he would make no attempt to obtain it; for any annoyance\r\nwhich he might give the proprietor by complaining to the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities would be sure to be paid back to him with interest in some\r\nindirect way.\r\n\r\nThe sons of the clergy who did not succeed in finding regular sacerdotal\r\nemployment were in a still worse position. Many of them served as\r\nscribes or subordinate officials in the public offices, where they\r\ncommonly eked out their scanty salaries by unblushing extortion and\r\npilfering. Those who did not succeed in gaining even modest employment\r\nof this kind had to keep off starvation by less lawful means, and not\r\nunfrequently found their way into the prisons or to Siberia.\r\n\r\nIn judging of the Russian priesthood of the present time, we must call\r\nto mind this severe school through which it has passed, and we must\r\nalso take into consideration the spirit which has been for centuries\r\npredominant in the Eastern Church--I mean the strong tendency both in\r\nthe clergy and in the laity to attribute an inordinate importance to\r\nthe ceremonial element of religion. Primitive mankind is everywhere and\r\nalways disposed to regard religion as simply a mass of mysterious rites\r\nwhich have a secret magical power of averting evil in this world\r\nand securing felicity in the next. To this general rule the Russian\r\npeasantry are no exception, and the Russian Church has not done all it\r\nmight have done to eradicate this conception and to bring religion into\r\ncloser association with ordinary morality. Hence such incidents as the\r\nfollowing are still possible: A robber kills and rifles a traveller,\r\nbut he refrains from eating a piece of cooked meat which he finds in the\r\ncart, because it happens to be a fast-day; a peasant prepares to rob a\r\nyoung attache of the Austrian Embassy in St. Petersburg, and ultimately\r\nkills his victim, but before going to the house he enters a church\r\nand commends his undertaking to the protection of the saints; a\r\nhousebreaker, when in the act of robbing a church, finds it difficult to\r\nextract the jewels from an Icon, and makes a vow that if a certain saint\r\nassists him he will place a rouble\u0027s-worth of tapers before the saint\u0027s\r\nimage! These facts are within the memory of the present generation. I\r\nknew the young attache, and saw him a few days before his death.\r\n\r\nAll these are of course extreme cases, but they illustrate a tendency\r\nwhich in its milder forms is only too general amongst the Russian\r\npeople--the tendency to regard religion as a mass of ceremonies which\r\nhave a magical rather than a spiritual significance. The poor woman who\r\nkneels at a religious procession in order that the Icon may be carried\r\nover her head, and the rich merchant who invites the priests to bring\r\nsome famous Icon to his house, illustrates this tendency in a more\r\nharmless form.\r\n\r\nAccording to a popular saying, \"As is the priest, so is the parish,\" and\r\nthe converse proposition is equally true--as is the parish, so is the\r\npriest. The great majority of priests, like the great majority of men\r\nin general, content themselves with simply striving to perform what is\r\nexpected of them, and their character is consequently determined to a\r\ncertain extent by the ideas and conceptions of their parishioners. This\r\nwill become more apparent if we contrast the Russian priest with the\r\nProtestant pastor.\r\n\r\nAccording to Protestant conceptions, the village pastor is a man of\r\ngrave demeanour and exemplary conduct, and possesses a certain amount\r\nof education and refinement. He ought to expound weekly to his flock, in\r\nsimple, impressive words, the great truths of Christianity, and exhort\r\nhis hearers to walk in the paths of righteousness. Besides this, he is\r\nexpected to comfort the afflicted, to assist the needy, to counsel those\r\nwho are harassed with doubts, and to admonish those who openly stray\r\nfrom the narrow path. Such is the ideal in the popular mind, and\r\npastors generally seek to realise it, if not in very deed, at least in\r\nappearance. The Russian priest, on the contrary, has no such ideal set\r\nbefore him by his parishioners. He is expected merely to conform\r\nto certain observances, and to perform punctiliously the rites and\r\nceremonies prescribed by the Church. If he does this without practising\r\nextortion his parishioners are quite satisfied. He rarely preaches or\r\nexhorts, and neither has nor seeks to have a moral influence over his\r\nflock. I have occasionally heard of Russian priests who approach to what\r\nI have termed the Protestant ideal, and I have even seen one or two of\r\nthem, but I fear they are not numerous.\r\n\r\nIn the above contrast I have accidentally omitted one important feature.\r\nThe Protestant clergy have in all countries rendered valuable service to\r\nthe cause of popular education. The reason of this is not difficult to\r\nfind. In order to be a good Protestant it is necessary to \"search the\r\nScriptures,\" and to do this, one must be able at least to read. To be a\r\ngood member of the Greek Orthodox Church, on the contrary, according to\r\npopular conceptions, the reading of the Scriptures is not necessary, and\r\ntherefore primary education has not in the eyes of the Greek Orthodox\r\npriest the same importance which it has in the eyes of the Protestant\r\npastor.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that the Russian people are in a certain sense\r\nreligions. They go regularly to church on Sundays and holy-days, cross\r\nthemselves repeatedly when they pass a church or Icon, take the Holy\r\nCommunion at stated seasons, rigorously abstain from animal food--not\r\nonly on Wednesdays and Fridays, but also during Lent and the other long\r\nfasts--make occasional pilgrimages to holy shrines, and, in a word,\r\nfulfil punctiliously the ceremonial observances which they suppose\r\nnecessary for salvation. But here their religiousness ends. They are\r\ngenerally profoundly ignorant of religious doctrine, and know little or\r\nnothing of Holy Writ. A peasant, it is said, was once asked by a priest\r\nif he could name the three Persons of the Trinity, and replied without a\r\nmoment\u0027s hesitation, \"How can one not know that, Batushka? Of course\r\nit is the Saviour, the Mother of God, and Saint Nicholas the\r\nmiracle-worker!\"\r\n\r\nThat answer represents fairly enough the theological attainments of a\r\nvery large section of the peasantry. The anecdote is so often repeated\r\nthat it is probably an invention, but it is not a calumny of theology\r\nand of what Protestants term the \"inner religious life\" the orthodox\r\nRussian peasant--of Dissenters, to whom these remarks do not apply, I\r\nshall speak later--has no conception. For him the ceremonial part of\r\nreligion suffices, and he has the most unbounded, childlike confidence\r\nin the saving efficacy of the rites which he practises. If he has been\r\nbaptised in infancy, has regularly observed the fasts, has annually\r\npartaken of the Holy Communion, and has just confessed and received\r\nextreme unction, he feels death approach with the most perfect\r\ntranquillity. He is tormented with no doubts as to the efficacy of faith\r\nor works, and has no fears that his past life may possibly have rendered\r\nhim unfit for eternal felicity. Like a man in a sinking ship who has\r\nbuckled on his life-preserver, he feels perfectly secure. With no fear\r\nfor the future and little regret for the present or the past, he awaits\r\ncalmly the dread summons, and dies with a resignation which a Stoic\r\nphilosopher might envy.\r\n\r\nIn the above paragraph I have used the word Icon, and perhaps the reader\r\nmay not clearly understand the word. Let me explain then, briefly,\r\nwhat an Icon is--a very necessary explanation, for the Icons play an\r\nimportant part in the religious observances of the Russian people.\r\n\r\nIcons are pictorial, usually half-length, representations of the\r\nSaviour, of the Madonna, or of a saint, executed in archaic Byzantine\r\nstyle, on a yellow or gold ground, and varying in size from a square\r\ninch to several square feet. Very often the whole picture, with the\r\nexception of the face and hands of the figure, is covered with a metal\r\nplaque, embossed so as to represent the form of the figure and the\r\ndrapery. When this plaque is not used, the crown and costume are often\r\nadorned with pearls and other precious stones--sometimes of great price.\r\n\r\nIn respect of religions significance, Icons are of two kinds: simple,\r\nand miraculous or miracle-working (tchudotvorny). The former are\r\nmanufactured in enormous quantities--chiefly in the province of\r\nVladimir, where whole villages are employed in this kind of work--and\r\nare to be found in every Russian house, from the hut of the peasant to\r\nthe palace of the Emperor. They are generally placed high up in a corner\r\nfacing the door, and good orthodox Christians on entering bow in that\r\ndirection, making at the same time the sign of the cross. Before and\r\nafter meals the same short ceremony is always performed. On the eve of\r\nfete-days a small lamp is kept burning before at least one of the Icons\r\nin the house.\r\n\r\nThe wonder-working Icons are comparatively few in number, and are always\r\ncarefully preserved in a church or chapel. They are commonly believed\r\nto have been \"not made with hands,\" and to have appeared in a miraculous\r\nway. A monk, or it may be a common mortal, has a vision, in which he\r\nis informed that he may find a miraculous Icon in such a place, and on\r\ngoing to the spot indicated he finds it, sometimes buried, sometimes\r\nhanging on a tree. The sacred treasure is then removed to a church, and\r\nthe news spreads like wildfire through the district. Thousands flock to\r\nprostrate themselves before the heaven-sent picture, and some are healed\r\nof their diseases--a fact that plainly indicates its miracle-working\r\npower. The whole affair is then officially reported to the Most Holy\r\nSynod, the highest ecclesiastical authority in Russia, in order that\r\nthe existence of the miracle-working power may be fully and regularly\r\nproved. The official recognition of the fact is by no means a mere\r\nmatter of form, for the Synod is well aware that wonder-working Icons\r\nare always a rich source of revenue to the monasteries where they are\r\nkept, and that zealous Superiors are consequently apt in such cases\r\nto lean to the side of credulity, rather than that of over-severe\r\ncriticism. A regular investigation is therefore made, and the formal\r\nrecognition is not granted till the testimony of the finder is\r\nthoroughly examined and the alleged miracles duly authenticated. If\r\nthe recognition is granted, the Icon is treated with the greatest\r\nveneration, and is sure to be visited by pilgrims from far and near.\r\n\r\nSome of the most revered Icons--as, for instance, the Kazan\r\nMadonna--have annual fete-days instituted in their honour; or, more\r\ncorrectly speaking, the anniversary of their miraculous appearance is\r\nobserved as a religions holiday. A few of them have an additional title\r\nto popular respect and veneration: that of being intimately associated\r\nwith great events in the national history. The Vladimir Madonna, for\r\nexample, once saved Moscow from the Tartars; the Smolensk Madonna\r\naccompanied the army in the glorious campaign against Napoleon in\r\n1812; and when in that year it was known in Moscow that the French were\r\nadvancing on the city, the people wished the Metropolitan to take the\r\nIberian Madonna, which may still be seen near one of the gates of the\r\nKremlin, and to lead them out armed with hatchets against the enemy.\r\n\r\nIf the Russian priests have done little to advance popular education,\r\nthey have at least never intentionally opposed it. Unlike their Roman\r\nCatholic brethren, they do not hold that \"a little learning is a\r\ndangerous thing,\" and do not fear that faith may be endangered by\r\nknowledge. Indeed, it is a remarkable fact that the Russian Church\r\nregards with profound apathy those various intellectual movements which\r\ncause serious alarm to many thoughtful Christians in Western Europe. It\r\nconsiders religion as something so entirely apart that its votaries\r\ndo not feel the necessity of bringing their theological beliefs into\r\nlogical harmony with their scientific conceptions. A man may remain a\r\ngood orthodox Christian long after he has adopted scientific opinions\r\nirreconcilable with Eastern Orthodoxy, or, indeed, with dogmatic\r\nChristianity of any kind. In the confessional the priest never seeks to\r\nferret out heretical opinions; and I can recall no instance in\r\nRussian history of a man being burnt at the stake on the demand of the\r\necclesiastical authorities, as so often happened in the Roman Catholic\r\nworld, for his scientific views. This tolerance proceeds partly, no\r\ndoubt, from the fact that the Eastern Church in general, and the\r\nRussian Church in particular, have remained for centuries in a kind of\r\nintellectual torpor. Even such a fervent orthodox Christian as the late\r\nIvan Aksakof perceived this absence of healthy vitality, and he did\r\nnot hesitate to declare his conviction that, \"neither the Russian nor the\r\nSlavonic world will be resuscitated . . . so long as the Church remains\r\nin such lifelessness (mertvennost\u0027), which is not a matter of chance,\r\nbut the legitimate fruit of some organic defect.\"*\r\n\r\n     * Solovyoff, \"Otcherki ig istorii Russkoi Literaturi XIX.\r\n     veka.\" St. Petersburg, 1903, p. 269.\r\n\r\nThough the unsatisfactory condition of the parochial clergy is generally\r\nrecognised by the educated classes, very few people take the trouble\r\nto consider seriously how it might be improved. During the Reform\r\nenthusiasm which raged for some years after the Crimean War\r\necclesiastical affairs were entirely overlooked. Many of the reformers\r\nof those days were so very \"advanced\" that religion in all its forms\r\nseemed to them an old-world superstition which tended to retard rather\r\nthan accelerate social progress, and which consequently should be\r\nallowed to die as tranquilly as possible; whilst the men of more\r\nmoderate views found they had enough to do in emancipating the serfs\r\nand reforming the corrupt civil and judicial Administration. During the\r\nsubsequent reactionary period, which culminated in the reign of the\r\nlate Emperor, Alexander III., much more attention was devoted to Church\r\nmatters, and it came to be recognised in official circles that something\r\nought to be done for the parish clergy in the way of improving their\r\nmaterial condition so as to increase their moral influence. With this\r\nobject in view, M. Pobedonostsef, the Procurator of the Holy Synod,\r\ninduced the Government in 1893 to make a State-grant of about 6,500,000\r\nroubles, which should be increased every year, but the sum was very\r\ninadequate, and a large portion of it was devoted to purposes of\r\npolitical propaganda in the form of maintaining Greek Orthodox priests\r\nin districts where the population was Protestant or Roman Catholic.\r\nConsequently, of the 35,865 parishes which Russia contains, only 18,936,\r\nor a little more than one-half, were enabled to benefit by the grant. In\r\nan optimistic, semi-official statement published as late as 1896 it is\r\nadmitted that \"the means for the support of the parish clergy must even\r\nnow be considered insufficient and wanting in stability, making the\r\npriests dependent on the parishioners, and thereby preventing the\r\nestablishment of the necessary moral authority of the spiritual father\r\nover his flock.\"\r\n\r\nIn some places the needs of the Church are attended to by voluntary\r\nparish-curatorships which annually raise a certain sum of money, and the\r\nway in which they distribute it is very characteristic of the Russian\r\npeople, who have a profound veneration for the Church and its rites, but\r\nvery little consideration for the human beings who serve at the altar.\r\nIn 14,564 parishes possessing such curatorships no less than 2,500,000\r\nroubles were collected, but of this sum 2,000,000 were expended on the\r\nmaintenance and embellishment of churches, and only 174,000 were devoted\r\nto the personal wants of the clergy. According to the semi-official\r\ndocument from which these figures are taken the whole body of the\r\nRussian White Clergy in 1893 numbered 99,391, of whom 42,513 were\r\npriests, 12,953 deacons, and 43,925 clerks.\r\n\r\nIn more recent observations among the parochial clergy I have noticed\r\npremonitory symptoms of important changes. This may be illustrated by\r\nan entry in my note-book, written in a village of one of the Southern\r\nprovinces, under date of 30th September, 1903:\r\n\r\n\"I have made here the acquaintance of two good specimens of the parish\r\nclergy, both excellent men in their way, but very different from each\r\nother. The elder one, Father Dmitri, is of the old school, a plain,\r\npractical man, who fulfils his duties conscientiously according to his\r\nlights, but without enthusiasm. His intellectual wants are very limited,\r\nand he devotes his attention chiefly to the practical affairs of\r\neveryday life, which he manages very successfully. He does not squeeze\r\nhis parishioners unduly, but he considers that the labourer is worthy of\r\nhis hire, and insists on his flock providing for his wants according to\r\ntheir means. At the same time he farms on his own account and attends\r\npersonally to all the details of his farming operations. With the\r\ncondition and doings of every member of his flock he is intimately\r\nacquainted, and, on the whole, as he never idealised anything or\r\nanybody, he has not a very high opinion of them.\r\n\r\n\"The younger priest, Father Alexander, is of a different type, and the\r\ndifference may be remarked even in his external appearance. There is a\r\nlook of delicacy and refinement about him, though his dress and\r\ndomestic surroundings are of the plainest, and there is not a tinge of\r\naffectation in his manner. His language is less archaic and picturesque.\r\nHe uses fewer Biblical and semi-Slavonic expressions--I mean expressions\r\nwhich belong to the antiquated language of the Church Service rather\r\nthan to modern parlance--and his armoury of terse popular proverbs\r\nwhich constitute such a characteristic trait of the peasantry, is less\r\nfrequently drawn on. When I ask him about the present condition of the\r\npeasantry, his account does not differ substantially from that of his\r\nelder colleague, but he does not condemn their sins in the same forcible\r\nterms. He laments their shortcomings in an evangelical spirit and has\r\napparently aspirations for their future improvement. Admitting frankly\r\nthat there is a great deal of lukewarmness among them, he hopes to\r\nrevive their interest in ecclesiastical affairs and he has an idea of\r\nconstituting a sort of church committee for attending to the temporal\r\naffairs of the village church and for works of charity, but he looks to\r\ninfluencing the younger rather than the older generation.\r\n\r\n\"His interest in his parishioners is not confined to their spiritual\r\nwelfare, but extends to their material well-being. Of late an\r\nassociation for mutual credit has been founded in the village, and\r\nhe uses his influence to induce the peasants to take advantage of the\r\nbenefits it offers, both to those who are in need of a little ready\r\nmoney and to those who might invest their savings, instead of keeping\r\nthem hidden away in an old stocking or buried in an earthen pot. The\r\nproposal to create a local agricultural society meets also with his\r\nsympathy.\"\r\n\r\nIf the number of parish priests of this type increase, the clergy may\r\ncome to exercise great moral influence on the common people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA MEDICAL CONSULTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nUnexpected Illness--A Village Doctor--Siberian Plague--My\r\nStudies--Russian Historians--A Russian Imitator of Dickens--A ci-devant\r\nDomestic Serf--Medicine and Witchcraft--A Remnant of Paganism--Credulity\r\nof the Peasantry--Absurd Rumours--A Mysterious Visit from St.\r\nBarbara--Cholera on Board a Steamer--Hospitals--Lunatic Asylums--Amongst\r\nManiacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the requisites for travelling in the less frequented\r\nparts of Russia, I omitted to mention one important condition: the\r\ntraveller should be always in good health, and in case of illness be\r\nready to dispense with regular medical attendance. This I learned by\r\nexperience during my stay at Ivanofka.\r\n\r\nA man who is accustomed to be always well, and has consequently cause\r\nto believe himself exempt from the ordinary ills that flesh is heir\r\nto, naturally feels aggrieved--as if some one had inflicted upon him\r\nan undeserved injury--when he suddenly finds himself ill. At first he\r\nrefuses to believe the fact, and, as far as possible, takes no notice of\r\nthe disagreeable symptoms.\r\n\r\nSuch was my state of mind on being awakened early one morning by\r\npeculiar symptoms which I had never before experienced. Unwilling to\r\nadmit to myself the possibility of being ill, I got up, and endeavoured\r\nto dress as usual, but very soon discovered that I was unable to stand.\r\nThere was no denying the fact; not only was I ill, but the malady,\r\nwhatever it was, surpassed my powers of diagnosis; and when the\r\nsymptoms increased steadily all that day and the following night, I\r\nwas constrained to take the humiliating decision of asking for medical\r\nadvice. To my inquiries whether there was a doctor in the neighbourhood,\r\nthe old servant replied, \"There is not exactly a doctor, but there is a\r\nFeldsher in the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is a Feldsher?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Feldsher is . . . . is a Feldsher.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite aware of that, but I would like to know what you mean by the\r\nword. What is this Feldsher?\"\r\n\r\n\"He\u0027s an old soldier who dresses wounds and gives physic.\"\r\n\r\nThe definition did not predispose me in favour of the mysterious\r\npersonage, but as there was nothing better to be had I ordered him to be\r\nsent for, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the old servant,\r\nwho evidently did not believe in feldshers.\r\n\r\nIn about half an hour a tall, broad-shouldered man entered, and\r\nstood bolt upright in the middle of the room in the attitude which\r\nis designated in military language by the word \"Attention.\" His\r\nclean-shaven chin, long moustache, and closely-cropped hair confirmed\r\none part of the old servant\u0027s definition; he was unmistakably an old\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n\"You are a Feldsher,\" I said, making use of the word which I had\r\nrecently added to my vocabulary.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, your Nobility!\" These words, the ordinary form of\r\naffirmation used by soldiers to their officers, were pronounced in a\r\nloud, metallic, monotonous tone, as if the speaker had been an automaton\r\nconversing with a brother automaton at a distance of twenty yards.\r\nAs soon as the words were pronounced the mouth of the machine closed\r\nspasmodically, and the head, which had been momentarily turned towards\r\nme, reverted to its former position with a jerk as if it had received\r\nthe order \"Eyes front!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then please to sit down here, and I\u0027ll tell you about my ailment.\"\r\nUpon this the figure took three paces to the front, wheeled to the\r\nright-about, and sat down on the edge of the chair, retaining the\r\nposition of \"Attention\" as nearly as the sitting posture would allow.\r\nWhen the symptoms had been carefully described, he knitted his brows,\r\nand after some reflection remarked, \"I can give you a dose of . . . .\"\r\nHere followed a long word which I did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"I don\u0027t wish you to give me a dose of anything till I know what is the\r\nmatter with me. Though a bit of a doctor myself, I have no idea what it\r\nis, and, pardon me, I think you are in the same position.\" Noticing\r\na look of ruffled professional dignity on his face, I added, as a\r\nsedative, \"It is evidently something very peculiar, so that if the first\r\nmedical practitioner in the country were present he would probably be as\r\nmuch puzzled as ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe sedative had the desired effect. \"Well, sir, to tell you the truth,\"\r\nhe said, in a more human tone of voice, \"I do not clearly understand\r\nwhat it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; and therefore I think we had better leave the cure to Nature,\r\nand not interfere with her mode of treatment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would be better.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt. And now, since I have to lie here on my back, and feel rather\r\nlonely, I should like to have a talk with you. You are not in a hurry, I\r\nhope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. My assistant knows where I am, and will send for me if I am\r\nrequired.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you have an assistant, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; a very sharp young fellow, who has been two years in the\r\nFeldsher school, and has now come here to help me and learn more by\r\npractice. That is a new way. I never was at a school of the kind myself,\r\nand had to pick up what I could when a servant in the hospital. There\r\nwere, I believe, no such schools in my time. The one where my assistant\r\nlearned was opened by the Zemstvo.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Zemstvo is the new local administration, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so. And I could not do without the assistant,\" continued my new\r\nacquaintance, gradually losing his rigidity, and showing himself, what\r\nhe really was, a kindly, talkative man. \"I have often to go to other\r\nvillages, and almost every day a number of peasants come here. At first\r\nI had very little to do, for the people thought I was an official, and\r\nwould make them pay dearly for what I should give them; but now they\r\nknow that they don\u0027t require to pay, and come in great numbers. And\r\neverything I give them--though sometimes I don\u0027t clearly understand what\r\nthe matter is--seems to do them good. I believe that faith does as much\r\nas physic.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my country,\" I remarked, \"there is a sect of doctors who get the\r\nbenefit of that principle. They give their patients two or three little\r\nballs no bigger than a pin\u0027s head, or a few drops of tasteless liquid,\r\nand they sometimes work wonderful cures.\"\r\n\r\n\"That system would not do for us. The Russian muzhik would have no\r\nfaith if he swallowed merely things of that kind. What he believes in is\r\nsomething with a very bad taste, and lots of it. That is his idea of a\r\nmedicine; and he thinks that the more he takes of a medicine the better\r\nchance he has of getting well. When I wish to give a peasant several\r\ndoses I make him come for each separate dose, for I know that if I did\r\nnot he would probably swallow the whole as soon as he was out of sight.\r\nBut there is not much serious disease here--not like what I used to see\r\non the Sheksna. You have been on the Sheksna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, but I intend going there.\" The Sheksna is a river which\r\nfalls into the Volga, and forms part of the great system of\r\nwater-communication connecting the Volga with the Neva.\r\n\r\n\"When you go there you will see lots of diseases. If there is a hot\r\nsummer, and plenty of barges passing, something is sure to break\r\nout--typhus, or black small-pox, or Siberian plague, or something of the\r\nkind. That Siberian plague is a curious thing. Whether it really comes\r\nfrom Siberia, God only knows. So soon as it breaks out the horses die\r\nby dozens, and sometimes men and women are attacked, though it is not\r\nproperly a human disease. They say that flies carry the poison from the\r\ndead horses to the people. The sign of it is a thing like a boil, with\r\na dark-coloured rim. If this is cut open in time the person may recover,\r\nbut if it is not, the person dies. There is cholera, too, sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a delightful country,\" I said to myself, \"for a young doctor who\r\nwishes to make discoveries in the science of disease!\"\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of diseases inhabiting this favoured region was apparently\r\nnot yet complete, but it was cut short for the moment by the arrival of\r\nthe assistant, with the announcement that his superior was wanted.\r\n\r\nThis first interview with the feldsher was, on the whole, satisfactory.\r\nHe had not rendered me any medical assistance, but he had helped me to\r\npass an hour pleasantly, and had given me a little information of the\r\nkind I desired. My later interviews with him were equally agreeable. He\r\nwas naturally an intelligent, observant man, who had seen a great deal\r\nof the Russian world, and could describe graphically what he had seen.\r\nUnfortunately the horizontal position to which I was condemned prevented\r\nme from noting down at the time the interesting things which he related\r\nto me. His visits, together with those of Karl Karl\u0027itch and of the\r\npriest, who kindly spent a great part of his time with me, helped me to\r\nwhile away many an hour which would otherwise have been dreary enough.\r\n\r\nDuring the intervals when I was alone I devoted myself to\r\nreading--sometimes Russian history and sometimes works of fiction. The\r\nhistory was that of Karamzin, who may fairly be called the Russian Livy.\r\nIt interested me much by the facts which it contained, but irritated me\r\nnot a little by the rhetorical style in which it is written. Afterwards,\r\nwhen I had waded through some twenty volumes of the gigantic work\r\nof Solovyoff--or Solovief, as the name is sometimes unphonetically\r\nwritten--which is simply a vast collection of valuable but undigested\r\nmaterial, I was much less severe on the picturesque descriptions and\r\nornate style of his illustrious predecessor. The first work of fiction\r\nwhich I read was a collection of tales by Grigorovitch, which had been\r\ngiven to me by the author on my departure from St. Petersburg. These\r\ntales, descriptive of rural life in Russia, had been written, as the\r\nauthor afterwards admitted to me, under the influence of Dickens. Many\r\nof the little tricks and affectations which became painfully obtrusive\r\nin Dickens\u0027s later works I had no difficulty in recognising under their\r\nRussian garb. In spite of these I found the book very pleasant reading,\r\nand received from it some new notions--to be afterwards verified, of\r\ncourse--about Russian peasant life.\r\n\r\nOne of these tales made a deep impression upon me, and I still remember\r\nthe chief incidents. The story opens with the description of a village\r\nin late autumn. It has been raining for some time heavily, and the road\r\nhas become covered with a deep layer of black mud. An old woman--a small\r\nproprietor--is sitting at home with a friend, drinking tea and trying to\r\nread the future by means of a pack of cards. This occupation is suddenly\r\ninterrupted by the entrance of a female servant, who announces that\r\nshe has discovered an old man, apparently very ill, lying in one of the\r\nouthouses. The old woman goes out to see her uninvited guest, and, being\r\nof a kindly nature, prepares to have him removed to a more comfortable\r\nplace, and properly attended to; but her servant whispers to her that\r\nperhaps he is a vagrant, and the generous impulse is thereby checked.\r\nWhen it is discovered that the suspicion is only too well founded, and\r\nthat the man has no passport, the old woman becomes thoroughly alarmed.\r\nHer imagination pictures to her the terrible consequences that would\r\nensue if the police should discover that she had harboured a vagrant.\r\nAll her little fortune might be extorted from her. And if the old man\r\nshould happen to die in her house or farmyard! The consequences in that\r\ncase might be very serious. Not only might she lose everything, but she\r\nmight even be dragged to prison. At the sight of these dangers the old\r\nwoman forgets her tender-heartedness, and becomes inexorable. The old\r\nman, sick unto death though he be, must leave the premises instantly.\r\nKnowing full well that he will nowhere find a refuge, he walks forth\r\ninto the cold, dark, stormy night, and next morning a dead body is found\r\nat a short distance from the village.\r\n\r\nWhy this story, which was not strikingly remarkable for artistic merit,\r\nimpressed me so deeply I cannot say. Perhaps it was because I was myself\r\nill at the time, and imagined how terrible it would be to be turned out\r\non the muddy road on a cold, wet October night. Besides this, the story\r\ninterested me as illustrating the terror which the police inspired\r\nduring the reign of Nicholas I. The ingenious devices which they\r\nemployed for extorting money formed the subject of another sketch, which\r\nI read shortly afterwards, and which has likewise remained in my memory.\r\nThe facts were as follows: An officer of rural police, when driving on\r\na country road, finds a dead body by the wayside. Congratulating himself\r\non this bit of good luck, he proceeds to the nearest village, and lets\r\nthe inhabitants know that all manner of legal proceedings will be taken\r\nagainst them, so that the supposed murderer may be discovered. The\r\npeasants are of course frightened, and give him a considerable sum of\r\nmoney in order that he may hush up the affair. An ordinary officer\r\nof police would have been quite satisfied with this ransom, but this\r\nofficer is not an ordinary man, and is very much in need of money; he\r\nconceives, therefore, the brilliant idea of repeating the experiment.\r\nTaking up the dead body, he takes it away in his tarantass, and a few\r\nhours later declares to the inhabitants of a village some miles off\r\nthat some of them have been guilty of murder, and that he intends to\r\ninvestigate the matter thoroughly. The peasants of course pay liberally\r\nin order to escape the investigation, and the rascally officer,\r\nemboldened by success, repeats the trick in different villages until he\r\nhas gathered a large sum.\r\n\r\nTales and sketches of this kind were very much in fashion during the\r\nyears which followed the death of the great autocrat, Nicholas I., when\r\nthe long-pent-up indignation against his severe, repressive regime was\r\nsuddenly allowed free expression, and they were still much read during\r\nthe first years of my stay in the country. Now the public taste\r\nhas changed. The reform enthusiast has evaporated, and the existing\r\nadministrative abuses, more refined and less comical than their\r\npredecessors, receive comparatively little attention from the satirists.\r\n\r\nWhen I did not feel disposed to read, and had none of my regular\r\nvisitors with me, I sometimes spent an hour or two in talking with the\r\nold man-servant who attended me. Anton was decidedly an old man, but\r\nwhat his age precisely was I never could discover; either he did not\r\nknow himself, or he did not wish to tell me. In appearance he seemed\r\nabout sixty, but from certain remarks which he made I concluded that he\r\nmust be nearer seventy, though he had scarcely a grey hair on his head.\r\nAs to who his father was he seemed, like the famous Topsy, to have no\r\nvery clear ideas, but he had an advantage over Topsy with regard to his\r\nmaternal ancestry. His mother had been a serf who had fulfilled for some\r\ntime the functions of a lady\u0027s maid, and after the death of her\r\nmistress had been promoted to a not very clearly defined position of\r\nresponsibility in the household. Anton, too, had been promoted in\r\nhis time. His first function in the household had been that of\r\nassistant-keeper of the tobacco-pipes, from which humble office he had\r\ngradually risen to a position which may be roughly designated as that of\r\nbutler. All this time he had been, of course, a serf, as his mother had\r\nbeen before him; but being naturally a man of sluggish intellect, he had\r\nnever thoroughly realised the fact, and had certainly never conceived\r\nthe possibility of being anything different from what he was. His master\r\nwas master, and he himself was Anton, obliged to obey his master, or\r\nat least conceal disobedience--these were long the main facts in his\r\nconception of the universe, and, as philosophers generally do with\r\nregard to fundamental facts or axioms, he had accepted them without\r\nexamination. By means of these simple postulates he had led a tranquil\r\nlife, untroubled by doubts, until the year 1861, when the so-called\r\nfreedom was brought to Ivanofka. He himself had not gone to the church\r\nto hear Batushka read the Tsar\u0027s manifesto, but his master, on returning\r\nfrom the ceremony, had called him and said, \"Anton, you are free now,\r\nbut the Tsar says you are to serve as you have done for two years\r\nlonger.\"\r\n\r\nTo this startling announcement Anton had replied coolly, \"Slushayus,\"\r\nor, as we would say, \"Yes, sir,\" and without further comment had gone to\r\nfetch his master\u0027s breakfast; but what he saw and heard during the next\r\nfew weeks greatly troubled his old conceptions of human society and\r\nthe fitness of things. From that time must be dated, I suppose, the\r\nexpression of mental confusion which his face habitually wore.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that roused his indignation was the conduct of his\r\nfellow-servants. Nearly all the unmarried ones seemed to be suddenly\r\nattacked by a peculiar matrimonial mania. The reason of this was that\r\nthe new law expressly gave permission to the emancipated serfs to marry\r\nas they chose without the consent of their masters, and nearly all the\r\nunmarried adults hastened to take advantage of their newly-acquired\r\nprivilege, though many of them had great difficulty in raising the\r\ncapital necessary to pay the priest\u0027s fees. Then came disorders among\r\nthe peasantry, the death of the old master, and the removal of the\r\nfamily first to St. Petersburg, and afterwards to Germany. Anton\u0027s mind\r\nhad never been of a very powerful order, and these great events had\r\nexercised a deleterious influence upon it. When Karl Karl\u0027itch, at the\r\nexpiry of the two years, informed him that he might now go where he\r\nchose, he replied, with a look of blank, unfeigned astonishment, \"Where\r\ncan I go to?\" He had never conceived the possibility of being forced\r\nto earn his bread in some new way, and begged Karl Karl\u0027itch to let him\r\nremain where he was. This request was readily granted, for Anton was an\r\nhonest, faithful servant, and sincerely attached to the family, and it\r\nwas accordingly arranged that he should receive a small monthly salary,\r\nand occupy an intermediate position between those of major-domo and head\r\nwatch-dog.\r\n\r\nHad Anton been transformed into a real watch-dog he could scarcely have\r\nslept more than he did. His power of sleeping, and his somnolence when\r\nhe imagined he was awake, were his two most prominent characteristics.\r\nOut of consideration for his years and his love of repose, I troubled\r\nhim as little as possible; but even the small amount of service which\r\nI demanded he contrived to curtail in an ingenious way. The time and\r\nexertion required for traversing the intervening space between his\r\nown room and mine might, he thought, be more profitably employed; and\r\naccordingly he extemporised a bed in a small ante-chamber, close to\r\nmy door, and took up there his permanent abode. If sonorous snoring be\r\nsufficient proof that the performer is asleep, then I must conclude that\r\nAnton devoted about three-fourths of his time to sleeping and a\r\nlarge part of the remaining fourth to yawning and elongated guttural\r\nejaculations. At first this little arrangement considerably annoyed me,\r\nbut I bore it patiently, and afterwards received my reward, for during\r\nmy illness I found it very convenient to have an attendant within call.\r\nAnd I must do Anton the justice to say that he served me well in his own\r\nsomnolent fashion. He seemed to have the faculty of hearing when asleep,\r\nand generally appeared in my room before he had succeeded in getting his\r\neyes completely open.\r\n\r\nAnton had never found time, during his long life, to form many opinions,\r\nbut he had somehow imbibed or inhaled a few convictions, all of a\r\ndecidedly conservative kind, and one of these was that feldshers were\r\nuseless and dangerous members of society. Again and again he had advised\r\nme to have nothing to do with the one who visited me, and more than once\r\nhe recommended to me an old woman of the name of Masha, who lived in\r\na village a few miles off. Masha was what is known in Russia as a\r\nznakharka--that is to say, a woman who is half witch, half medical\r\npractitioner--the whole permeated with a strong leaven of knavery.\r\nAccording to Anton, she could effect by means of herbs and charms every\r\npossible cure short of raising from the dead, and even with regard to\r\nthis last operation he cautiously refrained from expressing an opinion.\r\n\r\nThe idea of being subjected to a course of herbs and charms by an old\r\nwoman who probably knew very little about the hidden properties of\r\neither, did not seem to me inviting, and more than once I flatly\r\nrefused to have recourse to such unhallowed means. On due consideration,\r\nhowever, I thought that a professional interview with the old witch\r\nwould be rather amusing, and then a brilliant idea occurred to me! I\r\nwould bring together the feldsher and the znakharka, who no doubt hated\r\neach other with a Kilkenny-cat hatred, and let them fight out their\r\ndifferences before me for the benefit of science and my own delectation.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of my project, the more I congratulated myself on\r\nhaving conceived such a scheme; but, alas! in this very imperfectly\r\norganised world of ours brilliant ideas are seldom realised, and in this\r\ncase I was destined to be disappointed. Did the old woman\u0027s black art\r\nwarn her of approaching danger, or was she simply actuated by a feeling\r\nof professional jealousy and considerations of professional etiquette?\r\nTo this question I can give no positive answer, but certain it is that\r\nshe could not be induced to pay me a visit, and I was thus balked of\r\nmy expected amusement. I succeeded, however, in learning indirectly\r\nsomething about the old witch. She enjoyed among her neighbours that\r\nsolid, durable kind of respect which is founded on vague, undefinable\r\nfear, and was believed to have effected many remarkable cures. In the\r\ntreatment of syphilitic diseases, which are fearfully common among the\r\nRussian peasantry, she was supposed to be specially successful, and I\r\nhave no doubt, from the vague descriptions which I received, that the\r\ncharm which she employed in these cases was of a mercurial kind. Some\r\ntime afterward I saw one of her victims. Whether she had succeeded in\r\ndestroying the poison I know not, but she had at least succeeded in\r\ndestroying most completely the patient\u0027s teeth. How women of this kind\r\nobtain mercury, and how they have discovered its medicinal properties,\r\nI cannot explain. Neither can I explain how they have come to know the\r\npeculiar properties of ergot of rye, which they frequently employ for\r\nillicit purposes familiar to all students of medical jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThe znakharka and the feldsher represent two very different periods\r\nin the history of medical science--the magical and the scientific.\r\nThe Russian peasantry have still many conceptions which belong to the\r\nformer. The great majority of them are already quite willing, under\r\nordinary circumstances, to use the scientific means of healing; but as\r\nsoon as a violent epidemic breaks out, and the scientific means prove\r\nunequal to the occasion, the old faith revives, and recourse is had to\r\nmagical rites and incantations. Of these rites many are very curious.\r\nHere, for instance, is one which had been performed in a village near\r\nwhich I afterwards lived for some time. Cholera had been raging in the\r\ndistrict for several weeks. In the village in question no case had yet\r\noccurred, but the inhabitants feared that the dreaded visitor would soon\r\narrive, and the following ingenious contrivance was adopted for warding\r\noff the danger. At midnight, when the male population was supposed to\r\nbe asleep, all the maidens met in nocturnal costume, according to a\r\npreconcerted plan, and formed a procession. In front marched a girl,\r\nholding an Icon. Behind her came her companions, dragging a sokha--the\r\nprimitive plough commonly used by the peasantry--by means of a long\r\nrope. In this order the procession made the circuit of the entire\r\nvillage, and it was confidently believed that the cholera would not be\r\nable to overstep the magical circle thus described. Many of the males\r\nprobably knew, or at least suspected, what was going on; but they\r\nprudently remained within doors, knowing well that if they should\r\nbe caught peeping indiscreetly at the mystic ceremony, they would be\r\nunmercifully beaten by those who were taking part in it.\r\n\r\nThis custom is doubtless a survival of old pagan superstitions. The\r\nintroduction of the Icon is a modern innovation, which illustrates that\r\ncurious blending of paganism and Christianity which is often to be\r\nmet with in Russia, and of which I shall have more to say in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when an epidemic breaks out, the panic produced takes a more\r\ndangerous form. The people suspect that it is the work of the doctors,\r\nor that some ill-disposed persons have poisoned the wells, and no amount\r\nof reasoning will convince them that their own habitual disregard of\r\nthe most simple sanitary precautions has something to do with the\r\nphenomenon. I know of one case where an itinerant photographer was\r\nseverely maltreated in consequence of such suspicions; and once, in St.\r\nPetersburg, during the reign of Nicholas I., a serious riot took place.\r\nThe excited populace had already thrown several doctors out of the\r\nwindows of the hospital, when the Emperor arrived, unattended, in an\r\nopen carriage, and quelled the disturbance by his simple presence, aided\r\nby his stentorian voice.\r\n\r\nOf the ignorant credulity of the Russian peasantry I might relate\r\nmany curious illustrations. The most absurd rumours sometimes awaken\r\nconsternation throughout a whole district. One of the most common\r\nreports of this kind is that a female conscription is about to take\r\nplace. About the time of the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Alexander II. this report was specially frequent. A large\r\nnumber of young girls were to be kidnapped and sent to England in a red\r\nship. Why the ship was to be red I can easily explain, because in the\r\npeasants\u0027 language the conceptions of red and beautiful are expressed\r\nby the same word (krasny), and in the popular legends the epithet is\r\nindiscriminately applied to everything connected with princes and great\r\npersonages; but what was to be done with the kidnapped maidens when they\r\narrived at their destination, I never succeeded in discovering.\r\n\r\nThe most amusing instance of credulity which I can recall was the\r\nfollowing, related to me by a peasant woman who came from the village\r\nwhere the incident had occurred. One day in winter, about the time\r\nof sunset, a peasant family was startled by the entrance of a strange\r\nvisitor, a female figure, dressed as St. Barbara is commonly represented\r\nin the religious pictures. All present were very much astonished by this\r\napparition; but the figure told them, in a low, soft voice, to be of\r\ngood cheer, for she was St. Barbara, and had come to honour the family\r\nwith a visit as a reward for their piety. The peasant thus favoured was\r\nnot remarkable for his piety, but he did not consider it necessary to\r\ncorrect the mistake of his saintly visitor, and requested her to be\r\nseated. With perfect readiness she accepted the invitation, and began at\r\nonce to discourse in an edifying way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news of this wonderful apparition spread like wildfire,\r\nand all the inhabitants of the village, as well as those of a\r\nneighbouring village about a mile distant, collected in and around the\r\nhouse. Whether the priest was among those who came my informant did not\r\nknow. Many of those who had come could not get within hearing, but those\r\nat the outskirts of the crowd hoped that the saint might come out before\r\ndisappearing. Their hopes were gratified. About midnight the mysterious\r\nvisitor announced that she would go and bring St. Nicholas, the\r\nmiracle-worker, and requested all to remain perfectly still during her\r\nabsence. The crowd respectfully made way for her, and she passed out\r\ninto the darkness. With breathless expectation all awaited the arrival\r\nof St. Nicholas, who is the favourite saint of the Russian peasantry;\r\nbut hours passed, and he did not appear. At last, toward sunrise, some\r\nof the less zealous spectators began to return home, and those of them\r\nwho had come from the neighbouring village discovered to their horror\r\nthat during their absence their horses had been stolen! At once they\r\nraised the hue-and-cry; and the peasants scoured the country in all\r\ndirections in search of the soi-disant St. Barbara and her accomplices,\r\nbut they never recovered the stolen property. \"And serve them right, the\r\nblockheads!\" added my informant, who had herself escaped falling into\r\nthe trap by being absent from the village at the time.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add that the ordinary Russian peasant, though in some\r\nrespects extremely credulous, and, like all other people, subject to\r\noccasional panics, is by no means easily frightened by real dangers.\r\nThose who have seen them under fire will readily credit this statement.\r\nFor my own part, I have had opportunities of observing them merely\r\nin dangers of a non-military kind, and have often admired the perfect\r\ncoolness displayed. Even an epidemic alarms them only when it attains a\r\ncertain degree of intensity. Once I had a good opportunity of observing\r\nthis on board a large steamer on the Volga. It was a very hot day in\r\nthe early autumn. As it was well known that there was a great deal of\r\nAsiatic cholera all over the country, prudent people refrained from\r\neating much raw fruit; but Russian peasants are not generally prudent\r\nmen, and I noticed that those on board were consuming enormous\r\nquantities of raw cucumbers and water-melons. This imprudence was soon\r\nfollowed by its natural punishment. I refrain from describing the scene\r\nthat ensued, but I may say that those who were attacked received\r\nfrom the others every possible assistance. Had no unforeseen accident\r\nhappened, we should have arrived at Kazan on the following morning,\r\nand been able to send the patients to the hospital of that town; but\r\nas there was little water in the river, we had to cast anchor for the\r\nnight, and next morning we ran aground and stuck fast. Here we had to\r\nremain patiently till a smaller steamer hove in sight. All this time\r\nthere was not the slightest symptom of panic, and when the small steamer\r\ncame alongside there was no frantic rush to get away from the infected\r\nvessel, though it was quite evident that only a few of the passengers\r\ncould be taken off. Those who were nearest the gangway went quietly\r\non board the small steamer, and those who were less fortunate remained\r\npatiently till another steamer happened to pass.\r\n\r\nThe old conceptions of disease, as something that may be most\r\nsuccessfully cured by charms and similar means, are rapidly\r\ndisappearing. The Zemstvo--that is to say, the new local\r\nself-government--has done much towards this end by enabling the people\r\nto procure better medical attendance. In the towns there are public\r\nhospitals, which generally are--or at least seem to an unprofessional\r\neye--in a very satisfactory condition. The resident doctors are daily\r\nbesieged by a crowd of peasants, who come from far and near to ask\r\nadvice and receive medicines. Besides this, in some provinces feldshers\r\nare placed in the principal villages, and the doctor makes frequent\r\ntours of inspection. The doctors are generally well-educated men, and do\r\na large amount of work for a very small remuneration.\r\n\r\nOf the lunatic asylums, which are generally attached to the larger\r\nhospitals, I cannot speak very favourably. Some of the great central\r\nones are all that could be desired, but others are badly constructed and\r\nfearfully overcrowded. One or two of those I visited appeared to me to\r\nbe conducted on very patriarchal principles, as the following incident\r\nmay illustrate.\r\n\r\nI had been visiting a large hospital, and had remained there so long\r\nthat it was already dark before I reached the adjacent lunatic asylum.\r\nSeeing no lights in the windows, I proposed to my companion, who was\r\none of the inspectors, that we should delay our visit till the following\r\nmorning, but he assured me that by the regulations the lights ought not\r\nto be extinguished till considerably later, and consequently there was\r\nno objection to our going in at once. If there was no legal objection,\r\nthere was at least a physical obstruction in the form of a large wooden\r\ndoor, and all our efforts to attract the attention of the porter or some\r\nother inmate were unavailing. At last, after much ringing, knocking, and\r\nshouting, a voice from within asked us who we were and what we wanted. A\r\nbrief reply from my companion, not couched in the most polite or amiable\r\nterms, made the bolts rattle and the door open with surprising rapidity,\r\nand we saw before us an old man with long dishevelled hair, who, as\r\nfar as appearance went, might have been one of the lunatics, bowing\r\nobsequiously and muttering apologies.\r\n\r\nAfter groping our way along a dark corridor we entered a still darker\r\nroom, and the door was closed and locked behind us. As the key turned\r\nin the rusty lock a wild scream rang through the darkness! Then came\r\na yell, then a howl, and then various sounds which the poverty of the\r\nEnglish language prevents me from designating--the whole blending into\r\na hideous discord that would have been at home in some of the worst\r\nregions of Dante\u0027s Inferno. As to the cause of it I could not even form\r\na conjecture. Gradually my eyes became accustomed to the darkness, and I\r\ncould dimly perceive white figures flitting about the room. At the same\r\ntime I felt something standing near me, and close to my shoulder I saw\r\na pair of eyes and long streaming hair. On my other side, equally close,\r\nwas something very like a woman\u0027s night-cap. Though by no means of a\r\nnervous temperament, I felt uncomfortable. To be shut up in a dark\r\nroom with an indefinite number of excited maniacs is not a comfortable\r\nposition. How long the imprisonment lasted I know not--probably not more\r\nthan two or three minutes, but it seemed a long time. At last a light\r\nwas procured, and the whole affair was explained. The guardians, not\r\nexpecting the visit of an inspector at so late an hour, had retired for\r\nthe night much earlier than usual, and the old porter had put us into\r\nthe nearest ward until he could fetch a light--locking the door behind\r\nus lest any of the lunatics should escape. The noise had awakened one\r\nof the unfortunate inmates of the ward, and her hysterical scream had\r\nterrified the others.\r\n\r\nBy the influence of asylums, hospitals, and similar institutions, the\r\nold conceptions of disease, as I have said, are gradually dying out, but\r\nthe znakharka still finds practice. The fact that the znakharka is to be\r\nfound side by side not only with the feldsher, but also with the highly\r\ntrained bacteriologist, is very characteristic of Russian civilisation,\r\nwhich is a strange conglomeration of products belonging to very\r\ndifferent periods. The enquirer who undertakes the study of it will\r\nsometimes be scarcely less surprised than would be the naturalist\r\nwho should unexpectedly stumble upon antediluvian megatheria grazing\r\ntranquilly in the same field with prize Southdowns. He will discover\r\nthe most primitive institutions side by side with the latest products\r\nof French doctrinairism, and the most childish superstitions in close\r\nproximity with the most advanced free-thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA PEASANT FAMILY OF THE OLD TYPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIvan Petroff--His Past Life--Co-operative Associations--Constitution of\r\na Peasant\u0027s Household--Predominance of Economic Conceptions over those\r\nof Blood-relationship--Peasant Marriages--Advantages of Living in Large\r\nFamilies--Its Defects--Family Disruptions and their Consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy illness had at least one good result. It brought me into contact\r\nwith the feldsher, and through him, after my recovery, I made the\r\nacquaintance of several peasants living in the village. Of these by far\r\nthe most interesting was an old man called Ivan Petroff.\r\n\r\nIvan must have been about sixty years of age, but was still robust and\r\nstrong, and had the reputation of being able to mow more hay in a given\r\ntime than any other peasant in the village. His head would have made a\r\nline study for a portrait-painter. Like Russian peasants in general,\r\nhe wore his hair parted in the middle--a custom which perhaps owes its\r\norigin to the religious pictures. The reverend appearance given to his\r\nface by his long fair beard, slightly tinged with grey, was in part\r\ncounteracted by his eyes, which had a strange twinkle in them--whether\r\nof humour or of roguery, it was difficult to say. Under all\r\ncircumstances--whether in his light, nondescript summer costume, or in\r\nhis warm sheep-skin, or in the long, glossy, dark-blue, double-breasted\r\ncoat which he put on occasionally on Sundays and holidays--he always\r\nlooked a well-fed, respectable, prosperous member of society; whilst\r\nhis imperturbable composure, and the entire absence of obsequiousness or\r\ntruculence in his manner, indicated plainly that he possessed no small\r\namount of calm, deep-rooted self-respect. A stranger, on seeing him,\r\nmight readily have leaped to the conclusion that he must be the Village\r\nElder, but in reality he was a simple member of the Commune, like his\r\nneighbour, poor Zakhar Leshkof, who never let slip an opportunity of\r\ngetting drunk, was always in debt, and, on the whole, possessed a more\r\nthan dubious reputation.\r\n\r\nIvan had, it is true, been Village Elder some years before. When elected\r\nby the Village Assembly, against his own wishes, he had said quietly,\r\n\"Very well, children; I will serve my three years\"; and at the end of\r\nthat period, when the Assembly wished to re-elect him, he had answered\r\nfirmly, \"No, children; I have served my term. It is now the turn of some\r\none who is younger, and has more time. There\u0027s Peter Alekseyef, a good\r\nfellow, and an honest; you may choose him.\" And the Assembly chose the\r\npeasant indicated; for Ivan, though a simple member of the Commune, had\r\nmore influence in Communal affairs than any other half-dozen members put\r\ntogether. No grave matter was decided without his being consulted,\r\nand there was at least one instance on record of the Village Assembly\r\npostponing deliberations for a week because he happened to be absent in\r\nSt. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nNo stranger casually meeting Ivan would ever for a moment have suspected\r\nthat that big man, of calm, commanding aspect, had been during a great\r\npart of his life a serf. And yet a serf he had been from his birth till\r\nhe was about thirty years of age--not merely a serf of the State, but\r\nthe serf of a proprietor who had lived habitually on his property. For\r\nthirty years of his life he had been dependent on the arbitrary will of\r\na master who had the legal power to flog him as often and as severely\r\nas he considered desirable. In reality he had never been subjected to\r\ncorporal punishment, for the proprietor to whom he had belonged had\r\nbeen, though in some respects severe, a just and intelligent master.\r\n\r\nIvan\u0027s bright, sympathetic face had early attracted the master\u0027s\r\nattention, and it was decided that he should learn a trade. For this\r\npurpose he was sent to Moscow, and apprenticed there to a carpenter.\r\nAfter four years of apprenticeship he was able not only to earn his own\r\nbread, but to help the household in the payment of their taxes, and to\r\npay annually to his master a fixed yearly sum--first ten, then twenty,\r\nthen thirty, and ultimately, for some years immediately before the\r\nEmancipation, seventy roubles. In return for this annual sum he was free\r\nto work and wander about as he pleased, and for some years he had made\r\nample use of his conditional liberty. I never succeeded in extracting\r\nfrom him a chronological account of his travels, but I could gather\r\nfrom his occasional remarks that he had wandered over a great part of\r\nEuropean Russia. Evidently he had been in his youth what is colloquially\r\ntermed \"a roving blade,\" and had by no means confined himself to the\r\ntrade which he had learned during his four years of apprenticeship. Once\r\nhe had helped to navigate a raft from Vetluga to Astrakhan, a distance\r\nof about two thousand miles. At another time he had been at Archangel\r\nand Onega, on the shores of the White Sea. St. Petersburg and Moscow\r\nwere both well known to him, and he had visited Odessa.\r\n\r\nThe precise nature of Ivan\u0027s occupations during these wanderings I could\r\nnot ascertain; for, with all his openness of manner, he was extremely\r\nreticent regarding his commercial affairs. To all my inquiries on this\r\ntopic he was wont to reply vaguely, \"Lesnoe dyelo\"--that is to say,\r\n\"Timber business\"; and from this I concluded that his chief occupation\r\nhad been that of a timber merchant. Indeed, when I knew him, though he\r\nwas no longer a regular trader, he was always ready to buy any bit of\r\nforest that could be bought in the vicinity for a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nDuring all this nomadic period of his life Ivan had never entirely\r\nsevered his connection with his native village or with agricultural\r\nlife. When about the age of twenty he had spent several months at home,\r\ntaking part in the field labour, and had married a wife--a strong,\r\nhealthy young woman, who had been selected for him by his mother, and\r\nstrongly recommended to him on account of her good character and her\r\nphysical strength. In the opinion of Ivan\u0027s mother, beauty was a kind of\r\nluxury which only nobles and rich merchants could afford, and ordinary\r\ncomeliness was a very secondary consideration--so secondary as to be\r\nleft almost entirely out of sight. This was likewise the opinion of\r\nIvan\u0027s wife. She had never been comely herself, she used to say, but she\r\nhad been a good wife to her husband. He had never complained about her\r\nwant of good looks, and had never gone after those who were considered\r\ngood-looking. In expressing this opinion she always first bent forward,\r\nthen drew herself up to her full length, and finally gave a little jerky\r\nnod sideways, so as to clench the statement. Then Ivan\u0027s bright eye\r\nwould twinkle more brightly than usual, and he would ask her how she\r\nknew that--reminding her that he was not always at home. This was Ivan\u0027s\r\nstereotyped mode of teasing his wife, and every time he employed it he\r\nwas called an \"old scarecrow,\" or something of the kind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, Ivan\u0027s jocular remark had more significance in it than\r\nhis wife cared to admit, for during the first years of their married\r\nlife they had seen very little of each other. A few days after the\r\nmarriage, when according to our notions the honeymoon should be at its\r\nheight, Ivan had gone to Moscow for several months, leaving his young\r\nbride to the care of his father and mother. The young bride did not\r\nconsider this an extraordinary hardship, for many of her companions had\r\nbeen treated in the same way, and according to public opinion in that\r\npart of the country there was nothing abnormal in the proceeding.\r\nIndeed, it may be said in general that there is very little romance\r\nor sentimentality about Russian peasant marriages. In this as in other\r\nrespects the Russian peasantry are, as a class, extremely practical and\r\nmatter-of-fact in their conceptions and habits, and are not at all prone\r\nto indulge in sublime, ethereal sentiments of any kind. They have little\r\nor nothing of what may be termed the Hermann and Dorothea element\r\nin their composition, and consequently know very little about those\r\nsentimental, romantic ideas which we habitually associate with the\r\npreliminary steps to matrimony. Even those authors who endeavour to\r\nidealise peasant life have rarely ventured to make their story turn on\r\na sentimental love affair. Certainly in real life the wife is taken as a\r\nhelpmate, or in plain language a worker, rather than as a companion, and\r\nthe mother-in-law leaves her very little time to indulge in fruitless\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\nAs time wore on, and his father became older and frailer, Ivan\u0027s visits\r\nto his native place became longer and more frequent, and when the old\r\nman was at last incapable of work, Ivan settled down permanently and\r\nundertook the direction of the household. In the meantime his\r\nown children had been growing up. When I knew the family it\r\ncomprised--besides two daughters who had married early and gone to\r\nlive with their parents-in-law--Ivan and his wife, two sons, three\r\ndaughters-in-law, and an indefinite and frequently varying number of\r\ngrandchildren. The fact that there were three daughters-in-law and only\r\ntwo sons was the result of the Conscription, which had taken away the\r\nyoungest son shortly after his marriage. The two who remained spent only\r\na small part of the year at home. The one was a carpenter and the\r\nother a bricklayer, and both wandered about the country in search of\r\nemployment, as their father had done in his younger days. There was,\r\nhowever, one difference. The father had always shown a leaning towards\r\ncommercial transactions, rather than the simple practice of his\r\nhandicraft, and consequently he had usually lived and travelled alone.\r\nThe sons, on the contrary, confined themselves to their handicrafts, and\r\nwere always during the working season members of an artel.\r\n\r\nThe artel in its various forms is a curious institution. Those to which\r\nIvan\u0027s sons belonged were simply temporary, itinerant associations of\r\nworkmen, who during the summer lived together, fed together, worked\r\ntogether, and periodically divided amongst themselves the profits. This\r\nis the primitive form of the institution, and is now not very often met\r\nwith. Here, as elsewhere, capital has made itself felt, and destroyed\r\nthat equality which exists among the members of an artel in the above\r\nsense of the word. Instead of forming themselves into a temporary\r\nassociation, the workmen now generally make an engagement with a\r\ncontractor who has a little capital, and receive from him fixed monthly\r\nwages. The only association which exists in this case is for the\r\npurchase and preparation of provisions, and even these duties are very\r\noften left to the contractor.\r\n\r\nIn some of the larger towns there are artels of a much more complex\r\nkind--permanent associations, possessing a large capital, and\r\npecuniarily responsible for the acts of the individual members. Of\r\nthese, by far the most celebrated is that of the Bank Porters. These men\r\nhave unlimited opportunities of stealing, and are often entrusted with\r\nthe guarding or transporting of enormous sums; but the banker has no\r\ncause for anxiety, because he knows that if any defalcations occur\r\nthey will be made good to him by the artel. Such accidents very rarely\r\nhappen, and the fact is by no means so extraordinary as many people\r\nsuppose. The artel, being responsible for the individuals of which it\r\nis composed, is very careful in admitting new members, and a man when\r\nadmitted is closely watched, not only by the regularly constituted\r\noffice-bearers, but also by all his fellow-members who have an\r\nopportunity of observing him. If he begins to spend money too freely or\r\nto neglect his duties, though his employer may know nothing of the\r\nfact, suspicions are at once aroused among his fellow-members, and an\r\ninvestigation ensues--ending in summary expulsion if the suspicions\r\nprove to have been well founded. Mutual responsibility, in short,\r\ncreates a very effective system of mutual supervision.\r\n\r\nOf Ivan\u0027s sons, the one who was a carpenter visited his family only\r\noccasionally, and at irregular intervals; the bricklayer, on the\r\ncontrary, as building is impossible in Russia during the cold weather,\r\nspent the greater part of the winter at home. Both of them paid a large\r\npart of their earnings into the family treasury, over which their father\r\nexercised uncontrolled authority. If he wished to make any considerable\r\noutlay, he consulted his sons on the subject; but as he was a prudent,\r\nintelligent man, and enjoyed the respect and confidence of the family,\r\nhe never met with any strong opposition. All the field work was\r\nperformed by him with the assistance of his daughters-in-law; only at\r\nharvest time he hired one or two labourers to help him.\r\n\r\nIvan\u0027s household was a good specimen of the Russian peasant family\r\nof the old type. Previous to the Emancipation in 1861 there were\r\nmany households of this kind, containing the representatives of\r\nthree generations. All the members, young and old, lived together in\r\npatriarchal fashion under the direction and authority of the Head of the\r\nHouse, called usually the Khozain--that is to say, the Administrator;\r\nor, in some districts, the Bolshak, which means literally \"the Big\r\nOne.\" Generally speaking, this important position was occupied by the\r\ngrandfather, or, if he was dead, by the eldest brother, but the rule\r\nwas not very strictly observed. If, for instance, the grandfather became\r\ninfirm, or if the eldest brother was incapacitated by disorderly\r\nhabits or other cause, the place of authority was taken by some other\r\nmember--it might be by a woman--who was a good manager, and possessed\r\nthe greatest moral influence.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Head of the Household and the other members\r\ndepended on custom and personal character, and they consequently varied\r\ngreatly in different families. If the Big One was an intelligent man,\r\nof decided, energetic character, like my friend Ivan, there was probably\r\nperfect discipline in the household, except perhaps in the matter of\r\nfemale tongues, which do not readily submit to the authority even\r\nof their owners; but very often it happened that the Big One was not\r\nthoroughly well fitted for his post, and in that case endless quarrels\r\nand bickerings inevitably took place. Those quarrels were generally\r\ncaused and fomented by the female members of the family--a fact which\r\nwill not seem strange if we try to realise how difficult it must be\r\nfor several sisters-in-law to live together, with their children and a\r\nmother-in-law, within the narrow limits of a peasant\u0027s household. The\r\ncomplaints of the young bride, who finds that her mother-in-law puts all\r\nthe hard work on her shoulders, form a favourite motive in the popular\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nThe house, with its appurtenances, the cattle, the agricultural\r\nimplements, the grain and other products, the money gained from the\r\nsale of these products--in a word, the house and nearly everything it\r\ncontained--were the joint property of the family. Hence nothing was\r\nbought or sold by any member--not even by the Big One himself, unless he\r\npossessed an unusual amount of authority--without the express or tacit\r\nconsent of the other grown-up males, and all the money that was earned\r\nwas put into the common purse. When one of the sons left home to work\r\nelsewhere, he was expected to bring or send home all his earnings,\r\nexcept what he required for food, lodgings, and other necessary\r\nexpenses; and if he understood the word \"necessary\" in too lax a sense,\r\nhe had to listen to very plain-spoken reproaches when he returned.\r\nDuring his absence, which might last for a whole year or several years,\r\nhis wife and children remained in the house as before, and the money\r\nwhich he earned could be devoted to the payment of the family taxes.\r\n\r\nThe peasant household of the old type is thus a primitive labour\r\nassociation, of which the members have all things in common, and it is\r\nnot a little remarkable that the peasant conceives it as such rather\r\nthan as a family. This is shown by the customary terminology, for\r\nthe Head of the Household is not called by any word corresponding\r\nto Paterfamilias, but is termed, as I have said, Khozain, or\r\nAdministrator--a word that is applied equally to a farmer, a shopkeeper\r\nor the head of an industrial undertaking, and does not at all convey\r\nthe idea of blood-relationship. It is likewise shown by what takes\r\nplace when a household is broken up. On such occasions the degree of\r\nblood-relationship is not taken into consideration in the distribution\r\nof the property. All the adult male members share equally. Illegitimate\r\nand adopted sons, if they have contributed their share of labour,\r\nhave the same rights as the sons born in lawful wedlock. The married\r\ndaughter, on the contrary--being regarded as belonging to her husband\u0027s\r\nfamily--and the son who has previously separated himself from the\r\nhousehold, are excluded from the succession. Strictly speaking, the\r\nsuccession or inheritance is confined to the wearing apparel and any\r\nlittle personal effects of a deceased member. The house and all that it\r\ncontains belong to the little household community; and, consequently,\r\nwhen it is broken up, by the death of the Khozain or other cause, the\r\nmembers do not inherit, but merely appropriate individually what\r\nthey had hitherto possessed collectively. Thus there is properly no\r\ninheritance or succession, but simply liquidation and distribution of\r\nthe property among the members. The written law of inheritance founded\r\non the conception of personal property, is quite unknown to the\r\npeasantry, and quite inapplicable to their mode of life. In this way a\r\nlarge and most important section of the Code remains a dead letter for\r\nabout four-fifths of the population.\r\n\r\nThis predominance of practical economic considerations is exemplified\r\nalso by the way in which marriages are arranged in these large families.\r\nIn the primitive system of agriculture usually practised in Russia, the\r\nnatural labour-unit--if I may use such a term--comprises a man, a\r\nwoman, and a horse. As soon, therefore, as a boy becomes an able-bodied\r\nlabourer he ought to be provided with the two accessories necessary\r\nfor the completion of the labour-unit. To procure a horse, either by\r\npurchase or by rearing a foal, is the duty of the Head of the House;\r\nto procure a wife for the youth is the duty of \"the female Big One\"\r\n(Bolshukha). And the chief consideration in determining the choice is\r\nin both cases the same. Prudent domestic administrators are not to\r\nbe tempted by showy horses or beautiful brides; what they seek is not\r\nbeauty, but physical strength and capacity for work. When the youth\r\nreaches the age of eighteen he is informed that he ought to marry at\r\nonce, and as soon as he gives his consent negotiations are opened with\r\nthe parents of some eligible young person. In the larger villages the\r\nnegotiations are sometimes facilitated by certain old women called\r\nsvakhi, who occupy themselves specially with this kind of mediation; but\r\nvery often the affair is arranged directly by, or through the agency of,\r\nsome common friend of the two houses.\r\n\r\nCare must of course be taken that there is no legal obstacle, and\r\nthese obstacles are not always easily avoided in a small village, the\r\ninhabitants of which have been long in the habit of intermarrying.\r\nAccording to Russian ecclesiastical law, not only is marriage between\r\nfirst-cousins illegal, but affinity is considered as equivalent to\r\nconsanguinity--that is to say a mother-in-law and a sister-in-law are\r\nregarded as a mother and a sister--and even the fictitious relationship\r\ncreated by standing together at the baptismal font as godfather and\r\ngodmother is legally recognised, and may constitute a bar to matrimony.\r\nIf all the preliminary negotiations are successful, the marriage takes\r\nplace, and the bridegroom brings his bride home to the house of which\r\nhe is a member. She brings nothing with her as a dowry except her\r\ntrousseau, but she brings a pair of good strong arms, and thereby\r\nenriches her adopted family. Of course it happens occasionally--for\r\nhuman nature is everywhere essentially the same--that a young peasant\r\nfalls in love with one of his former playmates, and brings his little\r\nromance to a happy conclusion at the altar; but such cases are very\r\nrare, and as a rule it may be said that the marriages of the Russian\r\npeasantry are arranged under the influence of economic rather than\r\nsentimental considerations.\r\n\r\nThe custom of living in large families has many economic advantages. We\r\nall know the edifying fable of the dying man who showed to his sons by\r\nmeans of a piece of wicker-work the advantages of living together and\r\nassisting each other. In ordinary times the necessary expenses of a\r\nlarge household of ten members are considerably less than the combined\r\nexpenses of two households comprising five members each, and when a\r\n\"black day\" comes a large family can bear temporary adversity much\r\nmore successfully than a small one. These are principles of world-wide\r\napplication, but in the life of the Russian peasantry they have a\r\npeculiar force. Each adult peasant possesses, as I shall hereafter\r\nexplain, a share of the Communal land, but this share is not sufficient\r\nto occupy all his time and working power. One married pair can easily\r\ncultivate two shares--at least in all provinces where the peasant\r\nallotments are not very large. Now, if a family is composed of two\r\nmarried couples, one of the men can go elsewhere and earn money, whilst\r\nthe other, with his wife and sister-in-law, can cultivate the two\r\ncombined shares of land. If, on the contrary a family consists merely\r\nof one pair with their children, the man must either remain at home--in\r\nwhich case he may have difficulty in finding work for the whole of his\r\ntime--or he must leave home, and entrust the cultivation of his share\r\nof the land to his wife, whose time must be in great part devoted to\r\ndomestic affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the time of serfage the proprietors clearly perceived these and\r\nsimilar advantages, and compelled their serfs to live together in large\r\nfamilies. No family could be broken up without the proprietor\u0027s consent,\r\nand this consent was not easily obtained unless the family had assumed\r\nquite abnormal proportions and was permanently disturbed by domestic\r\ndissension. In the matrimonial affairs of the serfs, too, the majority\r\nof the proprietors systematically exercised a certain supervision,\r\nnot necessarily from any paltry meddling spirit, but because their own\r\nmaterial interests were thereby affected. A proprietor would not,\r\nfor instance, allow the daughter of one of his serfs to marry a serf\r\nbelonging to another proprietor--because he would thereby lose a female\r\nlabourer--unless some compensation were offered. The compensation might\r\nbe a sum of money, or the affair might be arranged on the principle of\r\nreciprocity by the master of the bridegroom allowing one of his female\r\nserfs to marry a serf belonging to the master of the bride.\r\n\r\nHowever advantageous the custom of living in large families may appear\r\nwhen regarded from the economic point of view, it has very serious\r\ndefects, both theoretical and practical.\r\n\r\nThat families connected by the ties of blood-relationship and marriage\r\ncan easily live together in harmony is one of those social axioms which\r\nare accepted universally and believed by nobody. We all know by our own\r\nexperience, or by that of others, that the friendly relations of two\r\nsuch families are greatly endangered by proximity of habitation. To\r\nlive in the same street is not advisable; to occupy adjoining houses is\r\npositively dangerous; and to live under the same roof is certainly fatal\r\nto prolonged amity. There may be the very best intentions on both sides,\r\nand the arrangement may be inaugurated by the most gushing expressions\r\nof undying affection and by the discovery of innumerable secret\r\naffinities, but neither affinities, affection, nor good intentions can\r\nwithstand the constant friction and occasional jerks which inevitably\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nNow the reader must endeavour to realise that Russian peasants, even\r\nwhen clad in sheep-skins, are human beings like ourselves. Though they\r\nare often represented as abstract entities--as figures in a table\r\nof statistics or dots on a diagram--they have in reality \"organs,\r\ndimensions, senses, affections, passions.\" If not exactly \"fed with the\r\nsame food,\" they are at least \"hurt with the same weapons, subject to\r\nthe same diseases, healed by the same means,\" and liable to be irritated\r\nby the same annoyances as we are. And those of them who live in large\r\nfamilies are subjected to a kind of probation that most of us have never\r\ndreamed of. The families comprising a large household not only live\r\ntogether, but have nearly all things in common. Each member works, not\r\nfor himself, but for the household, and all that he earns is expected to\r\ngo into the family treasury. The arrangement almost inevitably leads to\r\none of two results--either there are continual dissensions, or order is\r\npreserved by a powerful domestic tyranny.\r\n\r\nIt is quite natural, therefore, that when the authority of the landed\r\nproprietors was abolished in 1861, the large peasant families almost all\r\ncrumbled to pieces. The arbitrary rule of the Khozain was based on, and\r\nmaintained by, the arbitrary rule of the proprietor, and both naturally\r\nfell together. Households like that of our friend Ivan were preserved\r\nonly in exceptional cases, where the Head of the House happened to\r\npossess an unusual amount of moral influence over the other members.\r\n\r\nThis change has unquestionably had a prejudicial influence on the\r\nmaterial welfare of the peasantry, but it must have added considerably\r\nto their domestic comfort, and may perhaps produce good moral results.\r\nFor the present, however, the evil consequences are by far the most\r\nprominent. Every married peasant strives to have a house of his own,\r\nand many of them, in order to defray the necessary expenses, have been\r\nobliged to contract debts. This is a very serious matter. Even if the\r\npeasants could obtain money at five or six per cent., the position of\r\nthe debtors would be bad enough, but it is in reality much worse, for\r\nthe village usurers consider twenty or twenty-five per cent. a by no\r\nmeans exorbitant rate of interest. A laudable attempt has been made\r\nto remedy this state of things by village banks, but these have proved\r\nsuccessful only in certain exceptional localities. As a rule the peasant\r\nwho contracts debts has a hard struggle to pay the interest in ordinary\r\ntimes, and when some misfortune overtakes him--when, for instance, the\r\nharvest is bad or his horse is stolen--he probably falls hopelessly into\r\npecuniary embarrassments. I have seen peasants not specially addicted\r\nto drunkenness or other ruinous habits sink to a helpless state of\r\ninsolvency. Fortunately for such insolvent debtors, they are treated by\r\nthe law with extreme leniency. Their house, their share of the common\r\nland, their agricultural implements, their horse--in a word, all that\r\nis necessary for their subsistence, is exempt from sequestration. The\r\nCommune, however, may bring strong pressure to bear on those who do\r\nnot pay their taxes. When I lived among the peasantry in the seventies,\r\ncorporal punishment inflicted by order of the Commune was among the\r\nmeans usually employed; and though the custom was recently prohibited\r\nby an Imperial decree of Nicholas II, I am not at all sure that it has\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANTRY OF THE NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunal Land--System of Agriculture--Parish Fetes--Fasting--Winter\r\nOccupations--Yearly Migrations--Domestic Industries--Influence\r\nof Capital and Wholesale Enterprise--The State\r\nPeasants--Serf-dues--Buckle\u0027s \"History of Civilisation\"--A precocious\r\nYamstchik--\"People Who Play Pranks\"--A Midnight Alarm--The Far North.\r\n\r\n\r\nIvanofka may be taken as a fair specimen of the villages in the northern\r\nhalf of the country, and a brief description of its inhabitants will\r\nconvey a tolerably correct notion of the northern peasantry in general.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of the female population, and about one-half of the\r\nmale inhabitants, are habitually engaged in cultivating the Communal\r\nland, which comprises about two thousand acres of a light sandy soil.\r\nThe arable part of this land is divided into three large fields, each of\r\nwhich is cut up into long narrow strips. The first field is reserved\r\nfor the winter grain--that is to say, rye, which forms, in the shape of\r\nblack bread, the principal food of the rural population. In the second\r\nare raised oats for the horses, and buckwheat, which is largely used for\r\nfood. The third lies fallow, and is used in the summer as pasturage for\r\nthe cattle.\r\n\r\nAll the villagers in this part of the country divide the arable land\r\nin this way, in order to suit the triennial rotation of crops. This\r\ntriennial system is extremely simple. The field which is used this\r\nyear for raising winter grain will be used next year for raising summer\r\ngrain, and in the following year will lie fallow. Before being sown\r\nwith winter grain it ought to receive a certain amount of manure. Every\r\nfamily possesses in each of the two fields under cultivation one or more\r\nof the long narrow strips or belts into which they are divided.\r\n\r\nThe annual life of the peasantry is that of simple husbandman,\r\ninhabiting a country where the winter is long and severe. The\r\nagricultural year begins in April with the melting of the snow. Nature\r\nhas been lying dormant for some months. Awaking now from her long sleep,\r\nand throwing off her white mantle, she strives to make up for lost time.\r\nNo sooner has the snow disappeared than the fresh young grass begins to\r\nshoot up, and very soon afterwards the shrubs and trees begin to bud.\r\nThe rapidity of this transition from winter to spring astonishes the\r\ninhabitants of more temperate climes.\r\n\r\nOn St. George\u0027s Day (April 23rd*) the cattle are brought out for the\r\nfirst time, and sprinkled with holy water by the priest. They are never\r\nvery fat, but at this period of the year their appearance is truly\r\nlamentable. During the winter they have been cooped up in small\r\nunventilated cow-houses, and fed almost exclusively on straw; now, when\r\nthey are released from their imprisonment, they look like the ghosts of\r\ntheir former emaciated selves. All are lean and weak, many are lame, and\r\nsome cannot rise to their feet without assistance.\r\n\r\n     * With regard to saints\u0027 days, I always give the date\r\n     according to the old style.  To find the date according to\r\n     our calendar, thirteen days must be added.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the peasants are impatient to begin the field labour. An old\r\nproverb which they all know says: \"Sow in mud and you will be a prince\";\r\nand they always act in accordance with this dictate of traditional\r\nwisdom. As soon as it is possible to plough they begin to prepare the\r\nland for the summer grain, and this labour occupies them probably till\r\nthe end of May. Then comes the work of carting out manure and preparing\r\nthe fallow field for the winter grain, which will last probably till\r\nabout St. Peter\u0027s Day (June 29th), when the hay-making generally begins.\r\nAfter the hay-making comes the harvest, by far the busiest time of the\r\nyear. From the middle of July--especially from St. Elijah\u0027s Day (July\r\n20th), when the saint is usually heard rumbling along the heavens in his\r\nchariot of fire*--until the end of August, the peasant may work day and\r\nnight, and yet he will find that he has barely time to get all his\r\nwork done. In little more than a month he has to reap and stack his\r\ngrain--rye, oats, and whatever else he may have sown either in spring or\r\nin the preceding autumn--and to sow the winter grain for next year.\r\nTo add to his troubles, it sometimes happens that the rye and the\r\noats ripen almost simultaneously, and his position is then still more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n     * It is thus that the peasants explain the thunder, which is\r\n     often heard at that season.\r\n\r\nWhether the seasons favour him or not, the peasant has at this time\r\na hard task, for he can rarely afford to hire the requisite number\r\nof labourers, and has generally the assistance merely of his wife\r\nand family; but he can at this season work for a short time at high\r\npressure, for he has the prospect of soon obtaining a good rest and\r\nan abundance of food. About the end of September the field labour is\r\nfinished, and on the first day of October the harvest festival begins--a\r\njoyous season, during which the parish fetes are commonly celebrated.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate a parish fete in true orthodox fashion it is necessary\r\nto prepare beforehand a large quantity of braga--a kind of home-brewed\r\nsmall beer--and to bake a plentiful supply of piroghi or meat pies. Oil,\r\ntoo, has to be procured, and vodka (rye spirit) in goodly quantity.\r\nAt the same time the big room of the izba, as the peasant\u0027s house is\r\ncalled, has to be cleared, the floor washed, and the table and benches\r\nscrubbed. The evening before the fete, while the piroghi are being\r\nbaked, a little lamp burns before the Icon in the corner of the room,\r\nand perhaps one or two guests from a distance arrive in order that they\r\nmay have on the morrow a full day\u0027s enjoyment.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fete the proceedings begin by a long service\r\nin the church, at which all the inhabitants are present in their best\r\nholiday costumes, except those matrons and young women who remain at\r\nhome to prepare the dinner. About mid-day dinner is served in each izba\r\nfor the family and their friends. In general the Russian peasant\u0027s\r\nfare is of the simplest kind, and rarely comprises animal food of any\r\nsort--not from any vegetarian proclivities, but merely because beef,\r\nmutton, and pork are too expensive; but on a holiday, such as a parish\r\nfete, there is always on the dinner table a considerable variety of\r\ndishes. In the house of a well-to-do family there will be not only\r\ngreasy cabbage-soup and kasha--a dish made from buckwheat--but also\r\npork, mutton, and perhaps even beef. Braga will be supplied in unlimited\r\nquantities, and more than once vodka will be handed round. When the\r\nrepast is finished, all rise together, and, turning towards the Icon in\r\nthe corner, bow and cross themselves repeatedly. The guests then say to\r\ntheir host, \"Spasibo za khelb za sol\"--that is to say, \"Thanks for your\r\nhospitality,\" or more literally, \"Thanks for bread and salt\"; and\r\nthe host replies, \"Do not be displeased, sit down once more for good\r\nluck\"--or perhaps he puts the last part of his request into the form of\r\na rhyming couplet to the following effect: \"Sit down, that the hens\r\nmay brood, and that the chickens and bees may multiply!\" All obey this\r\nrequest, and there is another round of vodka.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner some stroll about, chatting with their friends, or go to\r\nsleep in some shady nook, whilst those who wish to make merry go to the\r\nspot where the young people are singing, playing, and amusing themselves\r\nin various ways. As the sun sinks towards the horizon, the more grave,\r\nstaid guests wend their way homewards, but many remain for supper;\r\nand as evening advances the effects of the vodka become more and more\r\napparent. Sounds of revelry are heard more frequently from the houses,\r\nand a large proportion of the inhabitants and guests appear on the road\r\nin various degrees of intoxication. Some of these vow eternal affection\r\nto their friends, or with flaccid gestures and in incoherent tones\r\nharangue invisible audiences; others stagger about aimlessly in\r\nbesotted self-contentment, till they drop down in a state of complete\r\nunconsciousness. There they will lie tranquilly till they are picked up\r\nby their less intoxicated friends, or more probably till they awake of\r\ntheir own accord next morning.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, a village fete in Russia is a saddening spectacle. It\r\naffords a new proof--where, alas! no new proof was required--that we\r\nnorthern nations, who know so well how to work, have not yet learned the\r\nart of amusing ourselves.\r\n\r\nIf the Russian peasant\u0027s food were always as good and plentiful as at\r\nthis season of the year, he would have little reason to complain; but\r\nthis is by no means the case. Gradually, as the harvest-time recedes, it\r\ndeteriorates in quality, and sometimes diminishes in quantity. Besides\r\nthis, during a great part of the year the peasant is prevented, by the\r\nrules of the Church, from using much that he possesses.\r\n\r\nIn southern climes, where these rules were elaborated and first\r\npractised, the prescribed fasts are perhaps useful not only in a\r\nreligious, but also in a sanitary sense. Having abundance of fruit and\r\nvegetables, the inhabitants do well to abstain occasionally from animal\r\nfood. But in countries like Northern and Central Russia the influence\r\nof these rules is very different. The Russian peasant cannot get as\r\nmuch animal food as he requires, whilst sour cabbage and cucumbers are\r\nprobably the only vegetables he can procure, and fruit of any kind is\r\nfor him an unattainable luxury. Under these circumstances, abstinence\r\nfrom eggs and milk in all their forms during several months of the year\r\nseems to the secular mind a superfluous bit of asceticism. If the Church\r\nwould direct her maternal solicitude to the peasant\u0027s drinking, and\r\nleave him to eat what he pleases, she might exercise a beneficial\r\ninfluence on his material and moral welfare. Unfortunately she has a\r\ngreat deal too much inherent immobility to attempt anything of the\r\nkind, so the muzhik, while free to drink copiously whenever he gets the\r\nchance, must fast during the seven weeks of Lent, during two or three\r\nweeks in June, from the beginning of November till Christmas, and on all\r\nWednesdays and Fridays during the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nFrom the festival time till the following spring there is no possibility\r\nof doing any agricultural work, for the ground is hard as iron, and\r\ncovered with a deep layer of snow. The male peasants, therefore, who\r\nremain in the villages, have very little to do, and may spend the\r\ngreater part of their time in lying idly on the stove, unless they\r\nhappen to have learned some handicraft that can be practised at home.\r\nFormerly, many of them were employed in transporting the grain to the\r\nmarket town, which might be several hundred miles distant; but now this\r\nspecies of occupation has been greatly diminished by the extension of\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nAnother winter occupation which was formerly practised, and has now\r\nalmost fallen into disuse, was that of stealing wood in the forest. This\r\nwas, according to peasant morality, no sin, or at most a very venial\r\noffence, for God plants and waters the trees, and therefore forests\r\nbelong properly to no one. So thought the peasantry, but the landed\r\nproprietors and the Administration of the Domains held a different\r\ntheory of property, and consequently precautions had to be taken to\r\navoid detection. In order to ensure success it was necessary to choose\r\na night when there was a violent snowstorm, which would immediately\r\nobliterate all traces of the expedition; and when such a night was\r\nfound, the operation was commonly performed with success. During the\r\nhours of darkness a tree would be felled, stripped of its branches,\r\ndragged into the village, and cut up into firewood, and at sunrise the\r\nactors would be tranquilly sleeping on the stove as if they had spent\r\nthe night at home. In recent years the judicial authorities have done\r\nmuch towards putting down this practice and eradicating the loose\r\nconceptions of property with which it was connected.\r\n\r\nFor the female part of the population the winter used to be a busy\r\ntime, for it was during these four or five months that the spinning\r\nand weaving had to be done, but now the big factories, with their cheap\r\nmethods of production, are rapidly killing the home industries, and the\r\nyoung girls are not learning to work at the jenny and the loom as their\r\nmothers and grandmothers did.\r\n\r\nIn many of the northern villages, where ancient usages happen to\r\nbe preserved, the tedium of the long winter evenings is relieved by\r\nso-called Besedy, a word which signifies literally conversazioni. A\r\nBeseda, however, is not exactly a conversazione as we understand the\r\nterm, but resembles rather what is by some ladies called a Dorcas\r\nmeeting, with this essential difference, that those present work for\r\nthemselves and not for any benevolent purposes. In some villages as many\r\nas three Besedy regularly assemble about sunset; one for the children,\r\nthe second for the young people, and the third for the matrons. Each of\r\nthe three has its peculiar character. In the first, the children work\r\nand amuse themselves under the superintendence of an old woman, who\r\ntrims the torch* and endeavours to keep order. The little girls spin\r\nflax in a primitive way without the aid of a jenny, and the boys,\r\nwho are, on the whole, much less industrious, make simple bits of\r\nwicker-work. Formerly--I mean within my own recollection--many of them\r\nused to make rude shoes of plaited bark, called lapty, but these are\r\nbeing rapidly supplanted by leather boots. These occupations do not\r\nprevent an almost incessant hum of talk, frequent discordant attempts\r\nto sing in chorus, and occasional quarrels requiring the energetic\r\ninterference of the old woman who controls the proceedings. To amuse her\r\nnoisy flock she sometimes relates to them, for the hundredth time, one\r\nof those wonderful old stories that lose nothing by repetition, and all\r\nlisten to her attentively, as if they had never heard the story before.\r\n\r\n     * The torch (lutchina) has now almost entirely disappeared\r\n     and been replaced by the petroleum lamp.\r\n\r\nThe second Beseda is held in another house by the young people of a\r\nriper age. Here the workers are naturally more staid, less given to\r\nquarrelling, sing more in harmony, and require no one to look after\r\nthem. Some people, however, might think that a chaperon or inspector\r\nof some kind would be by no means out of place, for a good deal of\r\nflirtation goes on, and if village scandal is to be trusted, strict\r\npropriety in thought, word, and deed is not always observed. How far\r\nthese reports are true I cannot pretend to say, for the presence of\r\na stranger always acts on the company like the presence of a severe\r\ninspector. In the third Beseda there is always at least strict decorum.\r\nHere the married women work together and talk about their domestic\r\nconcerns, enlivening the conversation occasionally by the introduction\r\nof little bits of village scandal.\r\n\r\nSuch is the ordinary life of the peasants who live by agriculture; but\r\nmany of the villagers live occasionally or permanently in the towns.\r\nProbably the majority of the peasants in this region have at some period\r\nof their lives gained a living elsewhere. Many of the absentees spend\r\nyearly a few months at home, whilst others visit their families only\r\noccasionally, and, it may be, at long intervals. In no case, however, do\r\nthey sever their connection with their native village. Even the peasant\r\nwho becomes a rich merchant and settles permanently with his family\r\nin Moscow or St. Petersburg remains probably a member of the Village\r\nCommune, and pays his share of the taxes, though he does not enjoy any\r\nof the corresponding privileges. Once I remember asking a rich man of\r\nthis kind, the proprietor of several large houses in St. Petersburg,\r\nwhy he did not free himself from all connection with his native Commune,\r\nwith which he had no longer any interests in common. His answer was, \"It\r\nis all very well to be free, and I don\u0027t want anything from the Commune\r\nnow; but my old father lives there, my mother is buried there, and I\r\nlike to go back to the old place sometimes. Besides, I have children,\r\nand our affairs are commercial (nashe dyelo torgovoe). Who knows but my\r\nchildren may be very glad some day to have a share of the Commune land?\"\r\n\r\nIn respect to these non-agricultural occupations, each district has its\r\nspecialty. The province of Yaroslavl, for instance, supplies the large\r\ntowns with waiters for the traktirs, or lower class of restaurants,\r\nwhilst the best hotels in Petersburg are supplied by the Tartars of\r\nKasimof, celebrated for their sobriety and honesty. One part of the\r\nprovince of Kostroma has a special reputation for producing carpenters\r\nand stove-builders, whilst another part, as I once discovered to\r\nmy surprise, sends yearly to Siberia--not as convicts, but as free\r\nlaborours--a large contingent of tailors and workers in felt! On\r\nquestioning some youngsters who were accompanying as apprentices one of\r\nthese bands, I was informed by a bright-eyed youth of about sixteen that\r\nhe had already made the journey twice, and intended to go every winter.\r\n\"And you always bring home a big pile of money with you?\" I inquired.\r\n\"Nitchevo!\" replied the little fellow, gaily, with an air of pride and\r\nself-confidence; \"last year I brought home three roubles!\" This\r\nanswer was, at the moment, not altogether welcome, for I had just been\r\ndiscussing with a Russian fellow-traveller as to whether the peasantry\r\ncan fairly be called industrious, and the boy\u0027s reply enabled my\r\nantagonist to score a point against me. \"You hear that!\" he said,\r\ntriumphantly. \"A Russian peasant goes all the way to Siberia and back\r\nfor three roubles! Could you get an Englishman to work at that rate?\"\r\n\"Perhaps not,\" I replied, evasively, thinking at the same time that if a\r\nyouth were sent several times from Land\u0027s End to John o\u0027 Groat\u0027s House,\r\nand obliged to make the greater part of the journey in carts or on foot,\r\nhe would probably expect, by way of remuneration for the time and labour\r\nexpended, rather more than seven and sixpence!\r\n\r\nVery often the peasants find industrial occupations without leaving\r\nhome, for various industries which do not require complicated machinery\r\nare practised in the villages by the peasants and their families. Wooden\r\nvessels, wrought iron, pottery, leather, rush-matting, and numerous\r\nother articles are thus produced in enormous quantities. Occasionally we\r\nfind not only a whole village, but even a whole district occupied almost\r\nexclusively with some one kind of manual industry. In the province of\r\nVladimir, for example, a large group of villages live by Icon-painting;\r\nin one locality near Nizhni-Novgorod nineteen villages are occupied\r\nwith the manufacture of axes; round about Pavlovo, in the same province,\r\neighty villages produce almost nothing but cutlery; and in a locality\r\ncalled Ouloma, on the borders of Novgorod and Tver, no less than two\r\nhundred villages live by nail-making.\r\n\r\nThese domestic industries have long existed, and were formerly an\r\nabundant source of revenue--providing a certain compensation for\r\nthe poverty of the soil. But at present they are in a very critical\r\nposition. They belong to the primitive period of economic development,\r\nand that period in Russia, as I shall explain in a future chapter, is\r\nnow rapidly drawing to a close. Formerly the Head of a Household bought\r\nthe raw material, had it worked up at home, and sold with a reasonable\r\nprofit the manufactured articles at the bazaars, as the local fairs are\r\ncalled, or perhaps at the great annual yarmarkt* of Nizhni-Novgorod.\r\nThis primitive system is now rapidly becoming obsolete. Capital and\r\nwholesale enterprise have come into the field and are revolutionising\r\nthe old methods of production and trade. Already whole groups of\r\nindustrial villages have fallen under the power of middle-men, who\r\nadvance money to the working households and fix the price of the\r\nproducts. Attempts are frequently made to break their power by voluntary\r\nco-operative associations, organised by the local authorities or\r\nbenevolent landed proprietors of the neighbourhood--like the benevolent\r\npeople in England who try to preserve the traditional cottage\r\nindustries--and some of the associations work very well; but the\r\nultimate success of such \"efforts to stem the current of capitalism\"\r\nis extremely doubtful. At the same time, the periodical bazaars and\r\nyarmarki, at which producers and consumers transacted their affairs\r\nwithout mediation, are being replaced by permanent stores and by various\r\nclasses of tradesmen--wholesale and retail.\r\n\r\n     * This term is a corruption of the German word Jahrmarkt.\r\n\r\nTo the political economist of the rigidly orthodox school this important\r\nchange may afford great satisfaction. According to his theories it is\r\na gigantic step in the right direction, and must necessarily redound\r\nto the advantage of all parties concerned. The producer now receives a\r\nregular supply of raw material, and regularly disposes of the articles\r\nmanufactured; and the time and trouble which he formerly devoted to\r\nwandering about in search of customers he can now employ more profitably\r\nin productive work. The creation of a class between the producers\r\nand the consumers is an important step towards that division and\r\nspecialisation of labour which is a necessary condition of industrial\r\nand commercial prosperity. The consumer no longer requires to go on a\r\nfixed day to some distant point, on the chance of finding there what he\r\nrequires, but can always buy what he pleases in the permanent stores.\r\nAbove all, the production is greatly increased in amount, and the price\r\nof manufactured goods is proportionally lessened.\r\n\r\nAll this seems clear enough in theory, and any one who values\r\nintellectual tranquillity will feel disposed to accept this view of the\r\ncase without questioning its accuracy; but the unfortunate traveller\r\nwho is obliged to use his eyes as well as his logical faculties may\r\nfind some little difficulty in making the facts fit into the a\r\npriori formula. Far be it from me to question the wisdom of political\r\neconomists, but I cannot refrain from remarking that of the three\r\nclasses concerned--small producers, middle-men, and consumers--two fail\r\nto perceive and appreciate the benefits which have been conferred upon\r\nthem. The small producers complain that on the new system they work\r\nmore and gain less; and the consumers complain that the manufactured\r\narticles, if cheaper and more showy in appearance, are far inferior in\r\nquality. The middlemen, who are accused, rightly or wrongly, of taking\r\nfor themselves the lion\u0027s share of the profits, alone seem satisfied\r\nwith the new arrangement.\r\n\r\nInteresting as this question undoubtedly is, it is not of permanent\r\nimportance, because the present state of things is merely transitory.\r\nThough the peasants may continue for a time to work at home for the\r\nwholesale dealers, they cannot in the long run compete with the\r\nbig factories and workshops, organised on the European model with\r\nsteam-power and complicated machinery, which already exist in many\r\nprovinces. Once a country has begun to move forward on the great highway\r\nof economic progress, there is no possibility of stopping halfway.\r\n\r\nHere again the orthodox economists find reason for congratulation,\r\nbecause big factories and workshops are the cheapest and most productive\r\nform of manufacturing industry; and again, the observant traveller\r\ncannot shut his eyes to ugly facts which force themselves on his\r\nattention. He notices that this cheapest and most productive form of\r\nmanufacturing industry does not seem to advance the material and moral\r\nwelfare of the population. Nowhere is there more disease, drunkenness,\r\ndemoralisation and misery than in the manufacturing districts.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not imagine that in making these statements I wish to\r\ncalumniate the spirit of modern enterprise, or to advocate a return to\r\nprimitive barbarism. All great changes produce a mixture of good and\r\nevil, and at first the evil is pretty sure to come prominently forward.\r\nRussia is at this moment in a state of transition, and the new condition\r\nof things is not yet properly organised. With improved organisation many\r\nof the existing evils will disappear. Already in recent years I have\r\nnoticed sporadic signs of improvement. When factories were first\r\nestablished no proper arrangements were made for housing and feeding\r\nthe workmen, and the consequent hardships were specially felt when the\r\nfactories were founded, as is often the case, in rural districts. Now,\r\nthe richer and more enterprising manufacturers build large barracks for\r\nthe workmen and their families, and provide them with common kitchens,\r\nwash-houses, steam-baths, schools, and similar requisites of civilised\r\nlife. At the same time the Government appoints inspectors to superintend\r\nthe sanitary arrangements and see that the health and comfort of the\r\nworkers are properly attended to.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we must assume that the activity of these inspectors tends\r\nto improve the condition of the working-classes. Certainly in some\r\ninstances it has that effect. I remember, for example, some thirty years\r\nago, visiting a lucifer-match factory in which the hands employed worked\r\nhabitually in an atmosphere impregnated with the fumes of phosphorus,\r\nwhich produce insidious and very painful diseases. Such a thing is\r\nhardly possible nowadays. On the other hand, official inspection, like\r\nFactory Acts, everywhere gives rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction\r\nand does not always improve the relations between employers and\r\nemployed. Some of the Russian inspectors, if I may credit the testimony\r\nof employers, are young gentlemen imbued with socialist notions, who\r\nintentionally stir up discontent or who make mischief from inexperience.\r\nAn amusing illustration of the current complaints came under my notice\r\nwhen, in 1903, I was visiting a landed proprietor of the southern\r\nprovinces, who has a large sugar factory on his estate. The inspector\r\nobjected to the traditional custom of the men sleeping in large\r\ndormitories and insisted on sleeping-cots being constructed for them\r\nindividually. As soon as the change was made the workmen came to the\r\nproprietor to complain, and put their grievance in an interrogative\r\nform: \"Are we cattle that we should be thus couped up in stalls?\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the northern agricultural region, the rural population\r\nhave a peculiar type, which is to be accounted for by the fact that\r\nthey never experienced to its full extent the demoralising influence of\r\nserfage. A large proportion of them were settled on State domains and\r\nwere governed by a special branch of the Imperial administration, whilst\r\nothers lived on the estates of rich absentee landlords, who were in the\r\nhabit of leaving the management of their properties to a steward acting\r\nunder a code of instructions. In either case, though serfs in the eye\r\nof the law, they enjoyed practically a very large amount of liberty. By\r\npaying a small sum for a passport they could leave their villages for\r\nan indefinite period, and as long as they sent home regularly the\r\nmoney required for taxes and dues, they were in little danger of being\r\nmolested. Many of them, though officially inscribed as domiciled in\r\ntheir native communes, lived permanently in the towns, and not a few\r\nsucceeded in amassing large fortunes. The effect of this comparative\r\nfreedom is apparent even at the present day. These peasants of the north\r\nare more energetic, more intelligent, more independent, and consequently\r\nless docile and pliable than those of the fertile central provinces.\r\nThey have, too, more education. A large proportion of them can read and\r\nwrite, and occasionally one meets among them men who have a keen desire\r\nfor knowledge. Several times I encountered peasants in this region who\r\nhad a small collection of books, and twice I found in such collections,\r\nmuch to my astonishment, a Russian translation of Buckle\u0027s \"History of\r\nCivilisation.\"\r\n\r\nHow, it may be asked, did a work of this sort find its way to such a\r\nplace? If the reader will pardon a short digression, I shall explain the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Crimean War there was a curious intellectual\r\nmovement--of which I shall have more to say hereafter--among the Russian\r\neducated classes. The movement assumed various forms, of which two of\r\nthe most prominent were a desire for encyclopaedic knowledge, and an\r\nattempt to reduce all knowledge to a scientific form. For men in this\r\nstate of mind Buckle\u0027s great work had naturally a powerful fascination.\r\nIt seemed at first sight to reduce the multifarious conflicting facts\r\nof human history to a few simple principles, and to evolve order out of\r\nchaos. Its success, therefore, was great. In the course of a few years\r\nno less than four independent translations were published and sold.\r\nEvery one read, or at least professed to have read, the wonderful book,\r\nand many believed that its author was the greatest genius of his time.\r\nDuring the first year of my residence in Russia (1870), I rarely had\r\na serious conversation without hearing Buckle\u0027s name mentioned; and\r\nmy friends almost always assumed that he had succeeded in creating a\r\ngenuine science of history on the inductive method. In vain I pointed\r\nout that Buckle had merely thrown out some hints in his introductory\r\nchapter as to how such a science ought to be constructed, and that\r\nhe had himself made no serious attempt to use the method which he\r\ncommended. My objections had little or no effect: the belief was\r\ntoo deep-rooted to be so easily eradicated. In books, periodicals,\r\nnewspapers, and professional lectures the name of Buckle was constantly\r\ncited--often violently dragged in without the slightest reason--and the\r\ncheap translations of his work were sold in enormous quantities. It is\r\nnot, then, so very wonderful after all that the book should have found\r\nits way to two villages in the province of Yaroslavl.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising, self-reliant, independent spirit which is often to\r\nbe found among those peasants manifests itself occasionally in amusing\r\nforms among the young generation. Often in this part of the country\r\nI have encountered boys who recalled young America rather than young\r\nRussia. One of these young hopefuls I remember well. I was waiting at a\r\npost-station for the horses to be changed, when he appeared before me\r\nin a sheep-skin, fur cap, and gigantic double-soled boots--all of which\r\narticles had been made on a scale adapted to future rather than actual\r\nrequirements. He must have stood in his boots about three feet eight\r\ninches, and he could not have been more than twelve years of age; but\r\nhe had already learned to look upon life as a serious business, wore a\r\ncommanding air, and knitted his innocent little brows as if the cares of\r\nan empire weighed on his diminutive shoulders. Though he was to act\r\nas yamstchik he had to leave the putting in of the horses to larger\r\nspecimens of the human species, but he took care that all was done\r\nproperly. Putting one of his big boots a little in advance, and drawing\r\nhimself up to his full shortness, he watched the operation attentively,\r\nas if the smallness of his stature had nothing to do with his\r\ninactivity. When all was ready, he climbed up to his seat, and at a\r\nsignal from the station-keeper, who watched with paternal pride all the\r\nmovements of the little prodigy, we dashed off at a pace rarely\r\nattained by post-horses. He had the faculty of emitting a peculiar\r\nsound--something between a whirr and a whistle--that appeared to have\r\na magical effect on the team and every few minutes he employed this\r\nincentive. The road was rough, and at every jolt he was shot upwards\r\ninto the air, but he always fell back into his proper position, and\r\nnever lost for a moment his self-possession or his balance. At the end\r\nof the journey I found we had made nearly fourteen miles within the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this energetic, enterprising spirit sometimes takes\r\nan illegitimate direction. Not only whole villages, but even whole\r\ndistricts, have in this way acquired a bad reputation for robbery, the\r\nmanufacture of paper-money, and similar offences against the criminal\r\nlaw. In popular parlance, these localities are said to contain \"people\r\nwho play pranks\" (narod shalit). I must, however, remark that, if I may\r\njudge by my own experience, these so-called \"playful\" tendencies are\r\ngreatly exaggerated. Though I have travelled hundreds of miles at\r\nnight on lonely roads, I was never robbed or in any way molested. Once,\r\nindeed, when travelling at night in a tarantass, I discovered on awaking\r\nthat my driver was bending over me, and had introduced his hand into one\r\nof my pockets; but the incident ended without serious consequences.\r\nWhen I caught the delinquent hand, and demanded an explanation from the\r\nowner, he replied, in an apologetic, caressing tone, that the night was\r\ncold, and he wished to warm his fingers; and when I advised him to use\r\nfor that purpose his own pockets rather than mine, he promised to act\r\nin future according to my advice. More than once, it is true, I believed\r\nthat I was in danger of being attacked, but on every occasion my fears\r\nturned out to be unfounded, and sometimes the catastrophe was ludicrous\r\nrather than tragical. Let the following serve as an illustration.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to traverse, in company with a Russian friend, the\r\ncountry lying to the east of the river Vetluga--a land of forest and\r\nmorass, with here and there a patch of cultivation. The majority of the\r\npopulation are Tcheremiss, a Finnish tribe; but near the banks of the\r\nriver there are villages of Russian peasants, and these latter have the\r\nreputation of \"playing pranks.\" When we were on the point of starting\r\nfrom Kozmodemiansk a town on the bank of the Volga, we received a visit\r\nfrom an officer of rural police, who painted in very sombre colours the\r\nhabits and moral character--or, more properly, immoral character--of\r\nthe people whose acquaintance we were about to make. He related with\r\nmelodramatic gesticulation his encounters with malefactors belonging to\r\nthe villages through which we had to pass, and ended the interview with\r\na strong recommendation to us not to travel at night, and to keep at all\r\ntimes our eyes open and our revolver ready. The effect of his narrative\r\nwas considerably diminished by the prominence of the moral, which was to\r\nthe effect that there never had been a police-officer who had shown\r\nso much zeal, energy, and courage in the discharge of his duty as the\r\nworthy man before us. We considered it, however, advisable to remember\r\nhis hint about keeping our eyes open.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our intention of being very cautious, it was already dark\r\nwhen we arrived at the village which was to be our halting-place for the\r\nnight, and it seemed at first as if we should be obliged to spend the\r\nnight in the open air. The inhabitants had already retired to rest,\r\nand refused to open their doors to unknown travellers. At length an old\r\nwoman, more hospitable than her neighbours, or more anxious to earn an\r\nhonest penny, consented to let us pass the night in an outer apartment\r\n(seni), and this permission we gladly accepted. Mindful of the warnings\r\nof the police officer, we barricaded the two doors and the window, and\r\nthe precaution was evidently not superfluous, for almost as soon as\r\nthe light was extinguished we could hear that an attempt was being made\r\nstealthily to effect an entrance. Notwithstanding my efforts to remain\r\nawake, and on the watch, I at last fell asleep, and was suddenly aroused\r\nby some one grasping me tightly by the arm. Instantly I sprang to my\r\nfeet and endeavoured to close with my invisible assailant. In vain! He\r\ndexterously eluded my grasp, and I stumbled over my portmanteau, which\r\nwas lying on the floor; but my prompt action revealed who the intruder\r\nwas, by producing a wild flutter and a frantic cackling! Before\r\nmy companion could strike a light the mysterious attack was fully\r\nexplained. The supposed midnight robber and possible assassin was simply\r\na peaceable hen that had gone to roost on my arm, and, on finding\r\nher position unsteady, had dug her claws into what she mistook for a\r\nroosting-pole!\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the peasantry of the north I have hitherto had in\r\nview the inhabitants of the provinces of Old-Novgorod, Tver, Yaroslavl,\r\nNizhni-Novgorod, Kostroma, Kazan, and Viatka, and I have founded my\r\nremarks chiefly on information collected on the spot. Beyond this lies\r\nwhat may be called the Far North. Though I cannot profess to have the\r\nsame personal acquaintance with the peasantry of that region, I may\r\nperhaps be allowed to insert here some information regarding them which\r\nI collected from various trustworthy sources.\r\n\r\nIf we draw a wavy line eastward from a point a little to the north of\r\nSt. Petersburg, as is shown in the map facing page 1 of this volume, we\r\nshall have between that line and the Polar Ocean what may be regarded as\r\na distinct, peculiar region, differing in many respects from the rest of\r\nRussia. Throughout the whole of it the climate is very severe. For about\r\nhalf of the year the ground is covered by deep snow, and the rivers are\r\nfrozen. By far the greater part of the land is occupied by forests of\r\npine, fir, larch, and birch, or by vast, unfathomable morasses. The\r\narable land and pasturage taken together form only about one and a half\r\nper cent, of the area. The population is scarce--little more than one\r\nto the English square mile--and settled chiefly along the banks of the\r\nrivers. The peasantry support themselves by fishing, hunting, felling\r\nand floating timber, preparing tar and charcoal, cattle-breeding, and,\r\nin the extreme north, breeding reindeer.\r\n\r\nThese are their chief occupations, but the people do not entirely\r\nneglect agriculture. They make the most of their short summer by\r\nmeans of a peculiar and ingenious mode of farming, well adapted to the\r\npeculiar local conditions. The peasant knows of course nothing about\r\nagronomical chemistry, but he, as well as his forefathers, have observed\r\nthat if wood be burnt on a field, and the ashes be mixed with the soil,\r\na good harvest may be confidently expected. On this simple principle his\r\nsystem of farming is based. When spring comes round and the leaves begin\r\nto appear on the trees, a band of peasants, armed with their hatchets,\r\nproceed to some spot in the woods previously fixed upon. Here they begin\r\nto make a clearing. This is no easy matter, for tree-felling is hard\r\nand tedious work; but the process does not take so much time as might be\r\nexpected, for the workmen have been brought up to the trade, and wield\r\ntheir axes with marvellous dexterity. When they have felled all the\r\ntrees, great and small, they return to their homes, and think no more\r\nabout their clearing till the autumn, when they return, in order to\r\nstrip the fallen trees of the branches, to pick out what they require\r\nfor building purposes or firewood, and to pile up the remainder in\r\nheaps. The logs for building or firewood are dragged away by horses as\r\nsoon as the first fall of snow has made a good slippery road, but the\r\npiles are allowed to remain till the following spring, when they are\r\nstirred up with long poles and ignited. The flames rapidly spread in all\r\ndirections till they join together and form a gigantic bonfire, such as\r\nis never seen in more densely-populated countries. If the fire does its\r\nwork properly, the whole of the space is covered with a layer of ashes;\r\nand when these have been slightly mixed with soil by means of a light\r\nplough, the seed is sown.\r\n\r\nOn the field prepared in this original fashion is sown barley, rye,\r\nor flax, and the harvests, nearly always good, sometimes border on the\r\nmiraculous. Barley or rye may be expected to produce about sixfold\r\nin ordinary years, and they may produce as much as thirty-fold under\r\npeculiarly favourable circumstances. The fertility is, however,\r\nshort-lived. If the soil is poor and stony, not more than two crops can\r\nbe raised; if it is of a better quality, it may give tolerable harvests\r\nfor six or seven successive years. In most countries this would be an\r\nabsurdly expensive way of manuring, for wood is much too valuable a\r\ncommodity to be used for such a purpose; but in this northern region the\r\nforests are boundless, and in the districts where there is no river or\r\nstream by which timber may be floated, the trees not used in this way\r\nrot from old age. Under these circumstances the system is reasonable,\r\nbut it must be admitted that it does not give a very large return for\r\nthe amount of labour expended, and in bad seasons it gives almost no\r\nreturn at all.\r\n\r\nThe other sources of revenue are scarcely less precarious. With his\r\ngun and a little parcel of provisions the peasant wanders about in the\r\ntrackless forests, and too often returns after many days with a very\r\nlight bag; or he starts in autumn for some distant lake, and comes\r\nback after five or six weeks with nothing better than perch and pike.\r\nSometimes he tries his luck at deep-sea fishing. In this case he starts\r\nin February--probably on foot--for Kem, on the shore of the White Sea,\r\nor perhaps for the more distant Kola, situated on a small river which\r\nfalls into the Arctic Ocean. There, in company with three or four\r\ncomrades, he starts on a fishing cruise along the Murman coast, or,\r\nit may be, off the coast of Spitzbergen. His gains will depend on the\r\namount caught, for it is a joint-venture; but in no case can they be\r\nvery great, for three-fourths of the fish brought into port belongs to\r\nthe owner of the craft and tackle. Of the sum realised, he brings home\r\nperhaps only a small part, for he has a strong temptation to buy\r\nrum, tea, and other luxuries, which are very dear in those northern\r\nlatitudes. If the fishing is good and he resists temptation, he may save\r\nas much as 100 roubles--about 10 pounds--and thereby live comfortably\r\nall winter; but if the fishing season is bad, he may find himself at the\r\nend of it not only with empty pockets, but in debt to the owner of the\r\nboat. This debt he may pay off, if he has a horse, by transporting the\r\ndried fish to Kargopol, St. Petersburg, or some other market.\r\n\r\nIt is here in the Far North that the ancient folk-lore--popular songs,\r\nstories, and fragments of epic poetry--has been best preserved; but this\r\nis a field on which I need not enter, for the reader can easily find all\r\nthat he may desire to know on the subject in the brilliant writings of\r\nM. Rambaud and the very interesting, conscientious works of the late Mr.\r\nRalston,* which enjoy a high reputation in Russia.\r\n\r\n     * Rambaud, \"La Russie Epique,\" Paris, 1876; Ralston, \"The\r\n     Songs of the Russian People,\" London, 1872; and \"Russian\r\n     Folk-tales,\" London, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MIR, OR VILLAGE COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial and Political Importance of the Mir--The Mir and the Family\r\nCompared--Theory of the Communal System--Practical Deviations from the\r\nTheory--The Mir a Good Specimen of Constitutional Government of the\r\nExtreme Democratic Type--The Village Assembly--Female Members--The\r\nElections--Distribution of the Communal Land.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had gained a clear notion of the family-life and occupations of\r\nthe peasantry, I turned my attention to the constitution of the village.\r\nThis was a subject which specially interested me, because I was aware\r\nthat the Mir is the most peculiar of Russian institutions. Long before\r\nvisiting Russia I had looked into Haxthausen\u0027s celebrated work, by which\r\nthe peculiarities of the Russian village system were first made known\r\nto Western Europe, and during my stay in St. Petersburg I had often\r\nbeen informed by intelligent, educated Russians that the rural Commune\r\npresented a practical solution of many difficult social problems with\r\nwhich the philosophers and statesmen of the West had long been vainly\r\nstruggling. \"The nations of the West\"--such was the substance of\r\ninnumerable discourses which I had heard--\"are at present on the\r\nhigh-road to political and social anarchy, and England has the\r\nunenviable distinction of being foremost in the race. The natural\r\nincrease of population, together with the expropriation of the small\r\nlandholders by the great landed proprietors, has created a dangerous and\r\never-increasing Proletariat--a great disorganised mass of human beings,\r\nwithout homes, without permanent domicile, without property of any kind,\r\nwithout any stake in the existing institutions. Part of these gain a\r\nmiserable pittance as agricultural labourers, and live in a condition\r\ninfinitely worse than serfage. The others have been forever uprooted\r\nfrom the soil, and have collected in the large towns, where they earn a\r\nprecarious living in the factories and workshops, or swell the ranks of\r\nthe criminal classes. In England you have no longer a peasantry in the\r\nproper sense of the term, and unless some radical measures be very soon\r\nadopted, you will never be able to create such a class, for men who\r\nhave been long exposed to the unwholesome influences of town life are\r\nphysically and morally incapable of becoming agriculturists.\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto,\" the disquisition proceeded, \"England has enjoyed, in\r\nconsequence of her geographical position, her political freedom, and her\r\nvast natural deposits of coal and iron, a wholly exceptional position\r\nin the industrial world. Fearing no competition, she has proclaimed\r\nthe principles of Free Trade, and has inundated the world with her\r\nmanufactures--using unscrupulously her powerful navy and all the other\r\nforces at her command for breaking down every barrier tending to check\r\nthe flood sent forth from Manchester and Birmingham. In that way her\r\nhungry Proletariat has been fed. But the industrial supremacy of England\r\nis drawing to a close. The nations have discovered the perfidious\r\nfallacy of Free-Trade principles, and are now learning to manufacture\r\nfor their own wants, instead of paying England enormous sums to\r\nmanufacture for them. Very soon English goods will no longer find\r\nforeign markets, and how will the hungry Proletariat then be fed?\r\nAlready the grain production of England is far from sufficient for the\r\nwants of the population, so that, even when the harvest is exceptionally\r\nabundant, enormous quantities of wheat are imported from all quarters\r\nof the globe. Hitherto this grain has been paid for by the manufactured\r\ngoods annually exported, but how will it be procured when these goods\r\nare no longer wanted by foreign consumers? And what then will the hungry\r\nProletariat do?\"*\r\n\r\n     * This passage was written, precisely as it stands, long\r\n     before the fiscal question was raised by Mr. Chamberlain.\r\n     It will be found in the first edition of this work,\r\n     published in 1877.  (Vol. I., pp. 179-81.)\r\n\r\nThis sombre picture of England\u0027s future had often been presented to me,\r\nand on nearly every occasion I had been assured that Russia had been\r\nsaved from these terrible evils by the rural Commune--an institution\r\nwhich, in spite of its simplicity and incalculable utility, West\r\nEuropeans seemed utterly incapable of understanding and appreciating.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now easily conceive with what interest I took to\r\nstudying this wonderful institution, and with what energy I prosecuted\r\nmy researches. An institution which professes to solve satisfactorily\r\nthe most difficult social problems of the future is not to be met with\r\nevery day, even in Russia, which is specially rich in material for the\r\nstudent of social science.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Ivanofka my knowledge of the institution was of that\r\nvague, superficial kind which is commonly derived from men who are\r\nfonder of sweeping generalisations and rhetorical declamation than of\r\nserious, patient study of phenomena. I knew that the chief personage in\r\na Russian village is the Selski Starosta, or Village Elder, and that all\r\nimportant Communal affairs are regulated by the Selski Skhod, or Village\r\nAssembly. Further, I was aware that the land in the vicinity of the\r\nvillage belongs to the Commune, and is distributed periodically among\r\nthe members in such a way that every able-bodied peasant possesses a\r\nshare sufficient, or nearly sufficient, for his maintenance. Beyond this\r\nelementary information I knew little or nothing.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at extending my knowledge was not very successful.\r\nHoping that my friend Ivan might be able to assist me, and knowing that\r\nthe popular name for the Commune is Mir, which means also \"the world,\" I\r\nput to him the direct, simple question, \"What is the Mir?\"\r\n\r\nIvan was not easily disconcerted, but for once he looked puzzled, and\r\nstared at me vacantly. When I endeavoured to explain to him my question,\r\nhe simply knitted his brows and scratched the back of his head. This\r\nlatter movement is the Russian peasant\u0027s method of accelerating cerebral\r\naction; but in the present instance it had no practical result. In\r\nspite of his efforts, Ivan could not get much further than the \"Kak vam\r\nskazat\u0027?\" that is to say, \"How am I to tell you?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to perceive that I had adopted an utterly false\r\nmethod of investigation, and a moment\u0027s reflection sufficed to show\r\nme the absurdity of my question. I had asked from an uneducated man a\r\nphilosophical definition, instead of extracting from him material in\r\nthe form of concrete facts, and constructing therefrom a definition for\r\nmyself. These concrete facts Ivan was both able and willing to supply;\r\nand as soon as I adopted a rational mode of questioning, I obtained from\r\nhim all I wanted. The information he gave me, together with the results\r\nof much subsequent conversation and reading, I now propose to present to\r\nthe reader in my own words.\r\n\r\nThe peasant family of the old type is, as we have just seen, a kind of\r\nprimitive association in which the members have nearly all things in\r\ncommon. The village may be roughly described as a primitive association\r\non a larger scale.\r\n\r\nBetween these two social units there are many points of analogy. In both\r\nthere are common interests and common responsibilities. In both there\r\nis a principal personage, who is in a certain sense ruler within and\r\nrepresentative as regards the outside world: in the one case called\r\nKhozain, or Head of the Household, and in the other Starosta, or Village\r\nElder. In both the authority of the ruler is limited: in the one case\r\nby the adult members of the family, and in the other by the Heads of\r\nHouseholds. In both there is a certain amount of common property: in the\r\none case the house and nearly all that it contains, and in the other the\r\narable land and possibly a little pasturage. In both cases there is a\r\ncertain amount of common responsibility: in the one case for all the\r\ndebts, and in the other for all the taxes and Communal obligations.\r\nAnd both are protected to a certain extent against the ordinary legal\r\nconsequences of insolvency, for the family cannot be deprived of its\r\nhouse or necessary agricultural implements, and the Commune cannot be\r\ndeprived of its land, by importunate creditors.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many important points of contrast. The\r\nCommune is, of course, much larger than the family, and the mutual\r\nrelations of its members are by no means so closely interwoven. The\r\nmembers of a family all farm together, and those of them who earn money\r\nfrom other sources are expected to put their savings into the common\r\npurse; whilst the households composing a Commune farm independently, and\r\npay into the common treasury only a certain fixed sum.\r\n\r\nFrom these brief remarks the reader will at once perceive that a Russian\r\nvillage is something very different from a village in our sense of the\r\nterm, and that the villagers are bound together by ties quite unknown to\r\nthe English rural population. A family living in an English village has\r\nlittle reason to take an interest in the affairs of its neighbours. The\r\nisolation of the individual families is never quite perfect, for man,\r\nbeing a social animal, takes necessarily a certain interest in the\r\naffairs of those around him, and this social duty is sometimes fulfilled\r\nby the weaker sex with more zeal than is absolutely indispensable for\r\nthe public welfare; but families may live for many years in the same\r\nvillage without ever becoming conscious of common interests. So long as\r\nthe Jones family do not commit any culpable breach of public order, such\r\nas putting obstructions on the highway or habitually setting their\r\nhouse on fire, their neighbour Brown takes probably no interest in their\r\naffairs, and has no ground for interfering with their perfect liberty of\r\naction. Amongst the families composing a Russian village, such a state\r\nof isolation is impossible. The Heads of Households must often meet\r\ntogether and consult in the Village Assembly, and their daily occupation\r\nmust be influenced by the Communal decrees. They cannot begin to mow the\r\nhay or plough the fallow field until the Village Assembly has passed\r\na resolution on the subject. If a peasant becomes a drunkard, or takes\r\nsome equally efficient means to become insolvent, every family in the\r\nvillage has a right to complain, not merely in the interests of public\r\nmorality, but from selfish motives, because all the families are\r\ncollectively responsible for his taxes.* For the same reason no peasant\r\ncan permanently leave the village without the consent of the Commune,\r\nand this consent will not be granted until the applicant gives\r\nsatisfactory security for the fulfilment of his actual and future\r\nliabilities. If a peasant wishes to go away for a short time, in order\r\nto work elsewhere, he must obtain a written permission, which serves him\r\nas a passport during his absence; and he may be recalled at any moment\r\nby a Communal decree. In reality he is rarely recalled so long as he\r\nsends home regularly the full amount of his taxes--including the dues\r\nwhich he has to pay for the temporary passport--but sometimes the\r\nCommune uses the power of recall for purposes of extortion. If it\r\nbecomes known, for instance, that an absent member is receiving a good\r\nsalary or otherwise making money, he may one day receive a formal order\r\nto return at once to his native village, but he is probably informed at\r\nthe same time, unofficially, that his presence will be dispensed with if\r\nhe will send to the Commune a certain specified sum. The money thus sent\r\nis generally used by the Commune for convivial purposes. **\r\n\r\n     * This common responsibility for the taxes was abolished in\r\n     1903 by the Emperor, on the advice of M. Witte, and the\r\n     other Communal fetters are being gradually relaxed.  A\r\n     peasant may now, if he wishes, cease to be a member of the\r\n     Commune altogether, as soon as he has defrayed all his\r\n     outstanding obligations.\r\n\r\n     ** With the recent relaxing of the Communal fetters,\r\n     referred to in the foregoing note, this abuse should\r\n     disappear.\r\n\r\nIn all countries the theory of government and administration differs\r\nconsiderably from the actual practice. Nowhere is this difference\r\ngreater than in Russia, and in no Russian institution is it greater than\r\nin the Village Commune. It is necessary, therefore, to know both theory\r\nand practice; and it is well to begin with the former, because it is the\r\nsimpler of the two. When we have once thoroughly mastered the theory,\r\nit is easy to understand the deviations that are made to suit peculiar\r\nlocal conditions.\r\n\r\nAccording, then, to theory, all male peasants in every part of the\r\nEmpire are inscribed in census-lists, which form the basis of the direct\r\ntaxation. These lists are revised at irregular intervals, and all\r\nmales alive at the time of the \"revision,\" from the newborn babe to the\r\ncentenarian, are duly inscribed. Each Commune has a list of this kind,\r\nand pays to the Government an annual sum proportionate to the number of\r\nnames which the list contains, or, in popular language, according to the\r\nnumber of \"revision souls.\" During the intervals between the revisions\r\nthe financial authorities take no notice of the births and deaths. A\r\nCommune which has a hundred male members at the time of the revision\r\nmay have in a few years considerably more or considerably less than that\r\nnumber, but it has to pay taxes for a hundred members all the same until\r\na new revision is made for the whole Empire.\r\n\r\nNow in Russia, so far at least as the rural population is concerned, the\r\npayment of taxes is inseparably connected with the possession of land.\r\nEvery peasant who pays taxes is supposed to have a share of the land\r\nbelonging to the Commune. If the Communal revision lists contain a\r\nhundred names, the Communal land ought to be divided into a hundred\r\nshares, and each \"revision soul\" should enjoy his share in return for\r\nthe taxes which he pays.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed my explanations up to this point may\r\nnaturally conclude that the taxes paid by the peasants are in reality a\r\nspecies of rent for the land which they enjoy. Such a conclusion would\r\nnot be altogether justified. When a man rents a bit of land he acts\r\naccording to his own judgment, and makes a voluntary contract with the\r\nproprietor; but the Russian peasant is obliged to pay his taxes whether\r\nhe desires to enjoy land or not. The theory, therefore, that the\r\ntaxes are simply the rent of the land will not bear even superficial\r\nexamination. Equally untenable is the theory that they are a species of\r\nland-tax. In any reasonable system of land-dues the yearly sum imposed\r\nbears some kind of proportion to the quantity and quality of the land\r\nenjoyed; but in Russia it may be that the members of one Commune possess\r\nsix acres of bad land, and the members of the neighbouring Commune seven\r\nacres of good land, and yet the taxes in both cases are the same. The\r\ntruth is that the taxes are personal, and are calculated according to\r\nthe number of male \"souls,\" and the Government does not take the trouble\r\nto inquire how the Communal land is distributed. The Commune has to pay\r\ninto the Imperial Treasury a fixed yearly sum, according to the number\r\nof its \"revision souls,\" and distributes the land among its members as\r\nit thinks fit.\r\n\r\nHow, then, does the Commune distribute the land? To this question it is\r\nimpossible to reply in brief, general terms, because each Commune acts\r\nas it pleases!* Some act strictly according to the theory. These divide\r\ntheir land at the time of the revision into a number of portions or\r\nshares corresponding to the number of revision souls, and give to each\r\nfamily a number of shares corresponding to the number of revision souls\r\nwhich it contains. This is from the administrative point of view by\r\nfar the simplest system. The census-list determines how much land each\r\nfamily will enjoy, and the existing tenures are disturbed only by the\r\nrevisions which take place at irregular intervals.** But, on the other\r\nhand, this system has serious defects. The revision-list represents\r\nmerely the numerical strength of the families, and the numerical\r\nstrength is often not at all in proportion to the working power. Let us\r\nsuppose, for example, two families, each containing at the time of\r\nthe revision five male members. According to the census-list these two\r\nfamilies are equal, and ought to receive equal shares of the land; but\r\nin reality it may happen that the one contains a father in the prime of\r\nlife and four able-bodies sons, whilst the other contains a widow and\r\nfive little boys. The wants and working power of these two families are\r\nof course very different; and if the above system of distribution be\r\napplied, the man with four sons and a goodly supply of grandchildren\r\nwill probably find that he has too little land, whilst the widow with\r\nher five little boys will find it difficult to cultivate the five shares\r\nalloted to her, and utterly impossible to pay the corresponding amount\r\nof taxation--for in all cases, it must be remembered, the Communal\r\nburdens are distributed in the same proportion as the land.\r\n\r\n     * A long list of the various systems of allotment to be\r\n     found in individual Communes in different parts of the\r\n     country is given in the opening chapter of a valuable work\r\n     by Karelin, entitled \"Obshtchinnoye Vladyenie v Rossii\" (St.\r\n     Petersburg, 1893).  As my object is to convey to the reader\r\n     merely a general idea of the institution, I refrain from\r\n     confusing him by an enumeration of the endless divergencies\r\n     from the original type.\r\n\r\n     ** Since 1719 eleven revisions have been made, the last in\r\n     1897. The intervals varied from six to forty-one years.\r\n\r\nBut why, it may be said, should the widow not accept provisionally the\r\nfive shares, and let to others the part which she does not require? The\r\nbalance of rent after payment of the taxes might help her to bring up\r\nher young family.\r\n\r\nSo it seems to one acquainted only with the rural economy of England,\r\nwhere land is scarce, and always gives a revenue more than sufficient\r\nto defray the taxes. But in Russia the possession of a share of Communal\r\nland is often not a privilege, but a burden. In some Communes the land\r\nis so poor and abundant that it cannot be let at any price. In others\r\nthe soil will repay cultivation, but a fair rent will not suffice to pay\r\nthe taxes and dues.\r\n\r\nTo obviate these inconvenient results of the simpler system, many\r\nCommunes have adopted the expedient of allotting the land, not according\r\nto the number of revision souls, but according to the working power\r\nof the families. Thus, in the instance above supposed, the widow would\r\nreceive perhaps two shares, and the large household, containing five\r\nworkers, would receive perhaps seven or eight. Since the breaking-up of\r\nthe large families, such inequality as I have supposed is, of course,\r\nrare; but inequality of a less extreme kind does still occur, and\r\njustifies a departure from the system of allotment according to the\r\nrevision-lists.\r\n\r\nEven if the allotment be fair and equitable at the time of the revision,\r\nit may soon become unfair and burdensome by the natural fluctuations of\r\nthe population. Births and deaths may in the course of a very few years\r\nentirely alter the relative working power of the various families.\r\nThe sons of the widow may grow up to manhood, whilst two or three\r\nable-bodied members of the other family may be cut off by an epidemic.\r\nThus, long before a new revision takes place, the distribution of the\r\nland may be no longer in accordance with the wants and capacities of\r\nthe various families composing the Commune. To correct this, various\r\nexpedients are employed. Some Communes transfer particular lots from one\r\nfamily to another, as circumstances demand; whilst others make from\r\ntime to time, during the intervals between the revisions, a complete\r\nredistribution and reallotment of the land. Of these two systems the\r\nformer is now more frequently employed.\r\n\r\nThe system of allotment adopted depends entirely on the will of the\r\nparticular Commune. In this respect the Communes enjoy the most complete\r\nautonomy, and no peasant ever dreams of appealing against a Communal\r\ndecree.* The higher authorities not only abstain from all interference\r\nin the allotment of the Communal lands, but remain in profound ignorance\r\nas to which system the Communes habitually adopt. Though the Imperial\r\nAdministration has a most voracious appetite for symmetrically\r\nconstructed statistical tables--many of them formed chiefly out\r\nof materials supplied by the mysterious inner consciousness of the\r\nsubordinate officials--no attempt has yet been made, so far as I know,\r\nto collect statistical data which might throw light on this important\r\nsubject. In spite of the systematic and persistent efforts of the\r\ncentralised bureaucracy to regulate minutely all departments of the\r\nnational life, the rural Communes, which contain about five-sixths of\r\nthe population, remain in many respects entirely beyond its influence,\r\nand even beyond its sphere of vision! But let not the reader be\r\nastonished overmuch. He will learn in time that Russia is the land of\r\nparadoxes; and meanwhile he is about to receive a still more startling\r\nbit of information. In \"the great stronghold of Caesarian despotism\r\nand centralised bureaucracy,\" these Village Communes, containing about\r\nfive-sixths of the population, are capital specimens of representative\r\nConstitutional government of the extreme democratic type!\r\n\r\n     * This has been somewhat modified by recent legislation.\r\n     According to the Emancipation Law of 1861, redistribution of\r\n     the land could take place at any time provided it was voted\r\n     by a majority of two-thirds at the Village Assembly.  By a\r\n     law of 1893 redistribution cannot take place oftener than\r\n     once in twelve years, and must receive the sanction of\r\n     certain local authorities.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the rural Commune is a good specimen of Constitutional\r\ngovernment, I use the phrase in the English, and not in the Continental\r\nsense. In the Continental languages a Constitutional regime implies\r\nthe existence of a long, formal document, in which the functions of the\r\nvarious institutions, the powers of the various authorities, and the\r\nmethods of procedure are carefully defined. Such a document was never\r\nheard of in Russian Village Communes, except those belonging to the\r\nImperial Domains, and the special legislation which formerly regulated\r\ntheir affairs was repealed at the time of the Emancipation. At the\r\npresent day the Constitution of all the Village Communes is of the\r\nEnglish type--a body of unwritten, traditional conceptions, which have\r\ngrown up and modified themselves under the influence of ever-changing\r\npractical necessity. No doubt certain definitions of the functions and\r\nmutual relations of the Communal authorities might be extracted from\r\nthe Emancipation Law and subsequent official documents, but as a rule\r\nneither the Village Elder nor the members of the Village Assembly\r\never heard of such definitions; and yet every peasant knows, as if\r\nby instinct, what each of these authorities can do and cannot do. The\r\nCommune is, in fact, a living institution, whose spontaneous vitality\r\nenables it to dispense with the assistance and guidance of the written\r\nlaw, and its constitution is thoroughly democratic. The Elder represents\r\nmerely the executive power. The real authority resides in the Assembly,\r\nof which all Heads of Households are members.*\r\n\r\n     * An attempt was made by Alexander III. in 1884 to bring the\r\n     rural Communes under supervision and control by the\r\n     appointment of rural officials called Zemskiye Natchalniki.\r\n     Of this so-called reform I shall have occasion to speak\r\n     later.\r\n\r\nThe simple procedure, or rather the absence of all formal procedure,\r\nat the Assemblies, illustrates admirably the essentially practical\r\ncharacter of the institution. The meetings are held in the open air,\r\nbecause in the village there is no building--except the church, which\r\ncan be used only for religious purposes--large enough to contain all the\r\nmembers; and they almost always take place on Sundays or holidays,\r\nwhen the peasants have plenty of leisure. Any open space may serve as\r\na Forum. The discussions are occasionally very animated, but there is\r\nrarely any attempt at speech-making. If any young member should show\r\nan inclination to indulge in oratory, he is sure to be unceremoniously\r\ninterrupted by some of the older members, who have never any sympathy\r\nwith fine talking. The assemblage has the appearance of a crowd of\r\npeople who have accidentally come together and are discussing in little\r\ngroups subjects of local interest. Gradually some one group, containing\r\ntwo or three peasants who have more moral influence than their fellows,\r\nattracts the others, and the discussion becomes general. Two or more\r\npeasants may speak at a time, and interrupt each other freely--using\r\nplain, unvarnished language, not at all parliamentary--and the\r\ndiscussion may become a confused, unintelligible din; but at the\r\nmoment when the spectator imagines that the consultation is about to\r\nbe transformed into a free fight, the tumult spontaneously subsides,\r\nor perhaps a general roar of laughter announces that some one has been\r\nsuccessfully hit by a strong argumentum ad hominem, or biting personal\r\nremark. In any case there is no danger of the disputants coming to\r\nblows. No class of men in the world are more good-natured and pacific\r\nthan the Russian peasantry. When sober they never fight, and even when\r\nunder the influence of alcohol they are more likely to be violently\r\naffectionate than disagreeably quarrelsome. If two of them take to\r\ndrinking together, the probability is that in a few minutes, though they\r\nmay never have seen each other before, they will be expressing in very\r\nstrong terms their mutual regard and affection, confirming their words\r\nwith an occasional friendly embrace.\r\n\r\nTheoretically speaking, the Village Parliament has a Speaker, in the\r\nperson of the Village Elder. The word Speaker is etymologically less\r\nobjectionable than the term President, for the personage in question\r\nnever sits down, but mingles in the crowd like the ordinary members.\r\nObjection may be taken to the word on the ground that the Elder speaks\r\nmuch less than many other members, but this may likewise be said of the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons. Whatever we may call him, the Elder is\r\nofficially the principal personage in the crowd, and wears the insignia\r\nof office in the form of a small medal suspended from his neck by a thin\r\nbrass chain. His duties, however, are extremely light. To call to order\r\nthose who interrupt the discussion is no part of his functions. If he\r\ncalls an honourable member \"Durak\" (blockhead), or interrupts an orator\r\nwith a laconic \"Moltchi!\" (hold your tongue!), he does so in virtue of\r\nno special prerogative, but simply in accordance with a time-honoured\r\nprivilege, which is equally enjoyed by all present, and may be employed\r\nwith impunity against himself. Indeed, it may be said in general that\r\nthe phraseology and the procedure are not subjected to any strict rules.\r\nThe Elder comes prominently forward only when it is necessary to take\r\nthe sense of the meeting. On such occasions he may stand back a little\r\nfrom the crowd and say, \"Well, orthodox, have you decided so?\" and the\r\ncrowd will probably shout, \"Ladno! ladno!\" that is to say, \"Agreed!\r\nagreed!\"\r\n\r\nCommunal measures are generally carried in this way by acclamation; but\r\nit sometimes happens that there is such a diversity of opinion that it\r\nis difficult to tell which of the two parties has a majority. In this\r\ncase the Elder requests the one party to stand to the right and the\r\nother to the left. The two groups are then counted, and the minority\r\nsubmits, for no one ever dreams of opposing openly the will of the Mir.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Nicholas I. an attempt was made to regulate by the\r\nwritten law the procedure of Village Assemblies amongst the peasantry\r\nof the State Domains, and among other reforms voting by ballot was\r\nintroduced; but the new custom never struck root. The peasants did\r\nnot regard with favour the new method, and persisted in calling it,\r\ncontemptuously, \"playing at marbles.\" Here, again, we have one of those\r\nwonderful and apparently anomalous facts which frequently meet the\r\nstudent of Russian affairs: the Emperor Nicholas I., the incarnation of\r\nautocracy and the champion of the Reactionary Party throughout Europe,\r\nforces the ballot-box, the ingenious invention of extreme radicals, on\r\nseveral millions of his subjects!\r\n\r\nIn the northern provinces, where a considerable portion of the male\r\npopulation is always absent, the Village Assembly generally includes a\r\ngood many female members. These are women who, on account of the\r\nabsence or death of their husbands, happen to be for the moment Heads of\r\nHouseholds. As such they are entitled to be present, and their right to\r\ntake part in the deliberations is never called in question. In matters\r\naffecting the general welfare of the Commune they rarely speak, and if\r\nthey do venture to enounce an opinion on such occasions they have little\r\nchance of commanding attention, for the Russian peasantry are as yet\r\nlittle imbued with the modern doctrines of female equality, and express\r\ntheir opinion of female intelligence by the homely adage: \"The hair is\r\nlong, but the mind is short.\" According to one proverb, seven women\r\nhave collectively but one soul, and, according to a still more ungallant\r\npopular saying, women have no souls at all, but only a vapour. Woman,\r\ntherefore, as woman, is not deserving of much consideration, but a\r\nparticular woman, as Head of a Household, is entitled to speak on all\r\nquestions directly affecting the household under her care. If, for\r\ninstance, it be proposed to increase or diminish her household\u0027s share\r\nof the land and the burdens, she will be allowed to speak freely on\r\nthe subject, and even to indulge in personal invective against her male\r\nopponents. She thereby exposes herself, it is true, to uncomplimentary\r\nremarks; but any which she happens to receive she is pretty sure to\r\nrepay with interest--referring, perhaps, with pertinent virulence to\r\nthe domestic affairs of those who attack her. And when argument and\r\ninvective fail, she can try the effect of pathetic appeal, supported by\r\ncopious tears.\r\n\r\nAs the Village Assembly is really a representative institution in the\r\nfull sense of the term, it reflects faithfully the good and the bad\r\nqualities of the rural population. Its decisions are therefore usually\r\ncharacterised by plain, practical common sense, but it is subject\r\nto occasional unfortunate aberrations in consequence of pernicious\r\ninfluences, chiefly of an alcoholic kind. An instance of this fact\r\noccurred during my sojourn at Ivanofka. The question under discussion\r\nwas whether a kabak, or gin-shop, should be established in the village.\r\nA trader from the district town desired to establish one, and offered to\r\npay to the Commune a yearly sum for the necessary permission. The more\r\nindustrious, respectable members of the Commune, backed by the whole\r\nfemale population, were strongly opposed to the project, knowing full\r\nwell that a kabak would certainly lead to the ruin of more than one\r\nhousehold; but the enterprising trader had strong arguments wherewith\r\nto seduce a large number of the members, and succeeded in obtaining a\r\ndecision in his favour.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly discusses all matters affecting the Communal welfare,\r\nand, as these matters have never been legally defined, its recognised\r\ncompetence is very wide. It fixes the time for making the hay, and the\r\nday for commencing the ploughing of the fallow field; it decrees what\r\nmeasures shall be employed against those who do not punctually pay\r\ntheir taxes; it decides whether a new member shall be admitted into\r\nthe Commune, and whether an old member shall be allowed to change his\r\ndomicile; it gives or withholds permission to erect new buildings on\r\nthe Communal land; it prepares and signs all contracts which the Commune\r\nmakes with one of its own members or with a stranger; it interferes\r\nwhenever it thinks necessary in the domestic affairs of its members; it\r\nelects the Elder--as well as the Communal tax-collector and watchman,\r\nwhere such offices exist--and the Communal herd-boy; above all, it\r\ndivides and allots the Communal land among the members as it thinks fit.\r\n\r\nOf all these various proceedings the English reader may naturally assume\r\nthat the elections are the most noisy and exciting. In reality this is a\r\nmistake. The elections produce little excitement, for the simple reason\r\nthat, as a rule, no one desires to be elected. Once, it is said, a\r\npeasant who had been guilty of some misdemeanor was informed by an\r\nArbiter of the Peace--a species of official of which I shall have\r\noccasion to speak in the sequel--that he would be no longer capable of\r\nfilling any Communal office; and instead of regretting this diminution\r\nof his civil rights, he bowed very low, and respectfully expressed his\r\nthanks for the new privilege which he had acquired. This anecdote may\r\nnot be true, but it illustrates the undoubted fact that the Russian\r\npeasant regards office as a burden rather than as an honour. There is no\r\ncivic ambition in those little rural commonwealths, whilst the privilege\r\nof wearing a bronze medal, which commands no respect, and the reception\r\nof a few roubles as salary afford no adequate compensation for the\r\ntrouble, annoyance, and responsibility which a Village Elder has to\r\nbear. The elections are therefore generally very tame and uninteresting.\r\nThe following description may serve as an illustration:\r\n\r\nIt is a Sunday afternoon. The peasants, male and female, have turned out\r\nin Sunday attire, and the bright costumes of the women help the sunshine\r\nto put a little rich colour into the scene, which is at ordinary times\r\nmonotonously grey. Slowly the crowd collects on the open space at the\r\nside of the church. All classes of the population are represented. On\r\nthe extreme outskirts are a band of fair-haired, merry children--some\r\nof them standing or lying on the grass and gazing attentively at the\r\nproceedings, and others running about and amusing themselves. Close\r\nto these stand a group of young girls, convulsed with half-suppressed\r\nlaughter. The cause of their merriment is a youth of some seventeen\r\nsummers, evidently the wag of the village, who stands beside them with\r\nan accordion in his hand, and relates to them in a half-whisper how he\r\nis about to be elected Elder, and what mad pranks he will play in that\r\ncapacity. When one of the girls happens to laugh outright, the matrons\r\nwho are standing near turn round and scowl; and one of them, stepping\r\nforward, orders the offender, in a tone of authority, to go home at once\r\nif she cannot behave herself. Crestfallen, the culprit retires, and the\r\nyouth who is the cause of the merriment makes the incident the subject\r\nof a new joke. Meanwhile the deliberations have begun. The majority of\r\nthe members are chatting together, or looking at a little group composed\r\nof three peasants and a woman, who are standing a little apart from the\r\nothers. Here alone the matter in hand is being really discussed. The\r\nwoman is explaining, with tears in her eyes, and with a vast amount of\r\nuseless repetition, that her \"old man,\" who is Elder for the time being,\r\nis very ill, and cannot fulfil his duties.\r\n\r\n\"But he has not yet served a year, and he\u0027ll get better,\" remarks one\r\npeasant, evidently the youngest of the little group.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" replies the woman, sobbing. \"It is the will of God, but\r\nI don\u0027t believe that he\u0027ll ever put his foot to the ground again. The\r\nFeldsher has been four times to see him, and the doctor himself came\r\nonce, and said that he must be brought to the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why has he not been taken there?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he be taken? Who is to carry him? Do you think he\u0027s a baby?\r\nThe hospital is forty versts off. If you put him in a cart he would die\r\nbefore he had gone a verst. And then, who knows what they do with people\r\nin the hospital?\" This last question contained probably the true reason\r\nwhy the doctor\u0027s orders had been disobeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, that\u0027s enough; hold your tongue,\" says the grey-beard of\r\nthe little group to the woman; and then, turning to the other peasants,\r\nremarks, \"There is nothing to be done. The Stanovoi [officer of rural\r\npolice] will be here one of these days, and will make a row again if we\r\ndon\u0027t elect a new Elder. Whom shall we choose?\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as this question is asked several peasants look down to the\r\nground, or try in some other way to avoid attracting attention, lest\r\ntheir names should be suggested. When the silence has continued a minute\r\nor two, the greybeard says, \"There is Alexei Ivanof; he has not served\r\nyet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, Alexei Ivanof!\" shout half-a-dozen voices, belonging probably\r\nto peasants who fear they may be elected.\r\n\r\nAlexei protests in the strongest terms. He cannot say that he is ill,\r\nbecause his big ruddy face would give him the lie direct, but he finds\r\nhalf-a-dozen other reasons why he should not be chosen, and accordingly\r\nrequests to be excused. But his protestations are not listened to, and\r\nthe proceedings terminate. A new Village Elder has been duly elected.\r\n\r\nFar more important than the elections is the redistribution of the\r\nCommunal land. It can matter but little to the Head of a Household how\r\nthe elections go, provided he himself is not chosen. He can accept\r\nwith perfect equanimity Alexei, or Ivan, or Nikolai, because the\r\noffice-bearers have very little influence in Communal affairs. But he\r\ncannot remain a passive, indifferent spectator when the division and\r\nallotment of the land come to be discussed, for the material welfare of\r\nevery household depends to a great extent on the amount of land and of\r\nburdens which it receives.\r\n\r\nIn the southern provinces, where the soil is fertile, and the taxes do\r\nnot exceed the normal rent, the process of division and allotment is\r\ncomparatively simple. Here each peasant desires to get as much land as\r\npossible, and consequently each household demands all the land to which\r\nit is entitled--that is to say, a number of shares equal to the number\r\nof its members inscribed in the last revision list. The Assembly has\r\ntherefore no difficult questions to decide. The Communal revision list\r\ndetermines the number of shares into which the land must be divided, and\r\nthe number of shares to be allotted to each family. The only difficulty\r\nlikely to arise is as to which particular shares a particular family\r\nshall receive, and this difficulty is commonly obviated by the custom of\r\ndrawing lots. There may be, it is true, some difference of opinion as\r\nto when a redistribution should be made, but this question is easily\r\ndecided by a vote of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nVery different is the process of division and allotment in many Communes\r\nof the northern provinces. Here the soil is often very unfertile and the\r\ntaxes exceed the normal rent, and consequently it may happen that the\r\npeasants strive to have as little land as possible. In these cases such\r\nscenes as the following may occur:\r\n\r\nIvan is being asked how many shares of the Communal land he will take,\r\nand replies in a slow, contemplative way, \"I have two sons, and there\r\nis myself, so I\u0027ll take three shares, or somewhat less, if it is your\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Less!\" exclaims a middle-aged peasant, who is not the Village Elder,\r\nbut merely an influential member, and takes the leading part in the\r\nproceedings. \"You talk nonsense. Your two sons are already old enough to\r\nhelp you, and soon they may get married, and so bring you two new female\r\nlabourers.\"\r\n\r\n\"My eldest son,\" explains Ivan, \"always works in Moscow, and the other\r\noften leaves me in summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they both send or bring home money, and when they get married, the\r\nwives will remain with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows what will be,\" replies Ivan, passing over in silence the\r\nfirst part of his opponent\u0027s remark. \"Who knows if they will marry?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can easily arrange that!\"\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot do. The times are changed now. The young people do as\r\nthey wish, and when they do get married they all wish to have houses of\r\ntheir own. Three shares will be heavy enough for me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. If they wish to separate from you, they will take some land\r\nfrom you. You must take at least four. The old wives there who have\r\nlittle children cannot take shares according to the number of souls.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a rich muzhik!\" says a voice in the crowd. \"Lay on him five\r\nsouls!\" (that is to say, give him five shares of the land and of the\r\nburdens).\r\n\r\n\"Five souls I cannot! By God, I cannot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, you shall have four,\" says the leading spirit to Ivan; and\r\nthen, turning to the crowd, inquires, \"Shall it be so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four! four!\" murmurs the crowd; and the question is settled.\r\n\r\nNext comes one of the old wives just referred to. Her husband is a\r\npermanent invalid, and she has three little boys, only one of whom is\r\nold enough for field labour. If the number of souls were taken as the\r\nbasis of distribution, she would receive four shares; but she would\r\nnever be able to pay four shares of the Communal burdens. She must\r\ntherefore receive less than that amount. When asked how many she will\r\ntake, she replies with downcast eyes, \"As the Mir decides, so be it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must take three.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, little father?\" cries the woman, throwing off suddenly\r\nher air of submissive obedience. \"Do you hear that, ye orthodox? They\r\nwant to lay upon me three souls! Was such a thing ever heard of? Since\r\nSt. Peter\u0027s Day my husband has been bedridden--bewitched, it seems, for\r\nnothing does him good. He cannot put a foot to the ground--all the same\r\nas if he were dead; only he eats bread!\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk nonsense,\" says a neighbour; \"he was in the kabak [gin-shop]\r\nlast week.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you!\" retorts the woman, wandering from the subject in hand; \"what\r\ndid YOU do last parish fete? Was it not you who got drunk and beat\r\nyour wife till she roused the whole village with her shrieking? And no\r\nfurther gone than last Sunday--pfu!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" says the old man, sternly cutting short the torrent of\r\ninvective. \"You must take at least two shares and a half. If you cannot\r\nmanage it yourself, you can get some one to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can that be? Where am I to get the money to pay a labourer?\"\r\nasks the woman, with much wailing and a flood of tears. \"Have pity, ye\r\northodox, on the poor orphans! God will reward you!\" and so on, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nI need not worry the reader with a further description of these scenes,\r\nwhich are always very long and sometimes violent. All present are deeply\r\ninterested, for the allotment of the land is by far the most important\r\nevent in Russian peasant life, and the arrangement cannot be made\r\nwithout endless talking and discussion. After the number of shares for\r\neach family has been decided, the distribution of the lots gives rise to\r\nnew difficulties. The families who have plentifully manured their land\r\nstrive to get back their old lots, and the Commune respects their claims\r\nso far as these are consistent with the new arrangement; but often it\r\nhappens that it is impossible to conciliate private rights and Communal\r\ninterests, and in such cases the former are sacrificed in a way that\r\nwould not be tolerated by men of Anglo-Saxon race. This leads, however,\r\nto no serious consequences. The peasants are accustomed to work together\r\nin this way, to make concessions for the Communal welfare, and to bow\r\nunreservedly to the will of the Mir. I know of many instances where\r\nthe peasants have set at defiance the authority of the police, of the\r\nprovincial governor, and of the central Government itself, but I have\r\nnever heard of any instance where the will of the Mir was openly opposed\r\nby one of its members.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages I have repeatedly spoken about \"shares of the\r\nCommunal land.\" To prevent misconception I must explain carefully what\r\nthis expression means. A share does not mean simply a plot or parcel of\r\nland; on the contrary, it always contains at least four, and may contain\r\na large number of distinct plots. We have here a new point of difference\r\nbetween the Russian village and the villages of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nCommunal land in Russia is of three kinds: the land on which the village\r\nis built, the arable land, and the meadow or hay-field, if the village\r\nis fortunate enough to possess one. On the first of these each family\r\npossesses a house and garden, which are the hereditary property of the\r\nfamily, and are never affected by the periodical redistributions. The\r\nother two kinds are both subject to redistribution, but on somewhat\r\ndifferent principles.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Communal arable land is first of all divided into three\r\nfields, to suit the triennial rotation of crops already described, and\r\neach field is divided into a number of long narrow strips--corresponding\r\nto the number of male members in the Commune--as nearly as possible\r\nequal to each other in area and quality. Sometimes it is necessary to\r\ndivide the field into several portions, according to the quality of the\r\nsoil, and then to subdivide each of these portions into the requisite\r\nnumber of strips. Thus in all cases every household possesses at\r\nleast one strip in each field; and in those cases where subdivision is\r\nnecessary, every household possesses a strip in each of the portions\r\ninto which the field is subdivided. It often happens, therefore, that\r\nthe strips are very narrow, and the portions belonging to each family\r\nvery numerous. Strips six feet wide are by no means rare. In 124\r\nvillages of the province of Moscow, regarding which I have special\r\ninformation, they varied in width from 3 to 45 yards, with an average\r\nof 11 yards. Of these narrow strips a household may possess as many\r\nas thirty in a single field! The complicated process of division and\r\nsubdivision is accomplished by the peasants themselves, with the aid\r\nof simple measuring-rods, and the accuracy of the result is truly\r\nmarvellous.\r\n\r\nThe meadow, which is reserved for the production of hay, is divided\r\ninto the same number of shares as the arable land. There, however, the\r\ndivision and distribution take place, not at irregular intervals, but\r\nannually. Every year, on a day fixed by the Assembly, the villagers\r\nproceed in a body to this part of their property, and divide it into\r\nthe requisite number of portions. Lots are then cast, and each family\r\nat once mows the portion allotted to it. In some Communes the meadow is\r\nmown by all the peasants in common, and the hay afterwards distributed\r\nby lot among the families; but this system is by no means so frequently\r\nused.\r\n\r\nAs the whole of the Communal land thus resembles to some extent a big\r\nfarm, it is necessary to make certain rules concerning cultivation.\r\nA family may sow what it likes in the land allotted to it, but all\r\nfamilies must at least conform to the accepted system of rotation.\r\nIn like manner, a family cannot begin the autumn ploughing before the\r\nappointed time, because it would thereby interfere with the rights of\r\nthe other families, who use the fallow field as pasturage.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little strange that this primitive system of land tenure\r\nshould have succeeded in living into the twentieth century, and still\r\nmore remarkable that the institution of which it forms an essential\r\npart should be regarded by many intelligent people as one of the great\r\ninstitutions of the future, and almost as a panacea for social and\r\npolitical evils. The explanation of these facts will form the subject of\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHOW THE COMMUNE HAS BEEN PRESERVED, AND WHAT IT IS TO EFFECT IN THE\r\nFUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nSweeping Reforms after the Crimean War--Protest Against the Laissez\r\nFaire Principle--Fear of the Proletariat--English and Russian Methods of\r\nLegislation Contrasted--Sanguine Expectations--Evil Consequences of\r\nthe Communal System--The Commune of the Future--Proletariat of the\r\nTowns--The Present State of Things Merely Temporary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably aware that immediately after the Crimean War\r\nRussia was subjected to a series of sweeping reforms, including the\r\nemancipation of the serfs and the creation of a new system of local\r\nself-government, and he may naturally wonder how it came to pass that\r\na curious, primitive institution like the rural Commune succeeded in\r\nweathering the bureaucratic hurricane. This strange phenomena I now\r\nproceed to explain, partly because the subject is in itself interesting,\r\nand partly because I hope thereby to throw some light on the peculiar\r\nintellectual condition of the Russian educated classes.\r\n\r\nWhen it became evident, in 1857, that the serfs were about to be\r\nemancipated, it was at first pretty generally supposed that the rural\r\nCommune would be entirely abolished, or at least radically modified. At\r\nthat time many Russians were enthusiastic, indiscriminate admirers of\r\nEnglish institutions, and believed, in common with the orthodox school\r\nof political economists, that England had acquired her commercial and\r\nindustrial superiority by adopting the principle of individual liberty\r\nand unrestricted competition, or, as French writers term it, the\r\n\"laissez faire\" principle. This principle is plainly inconsistent with\r\nthe rural Commune, which compels the peasantry to possess land, prevents\r\nan enterprising peasant from acquiring the land of his less enterprising\r\nneighbours, and places very considerable restrictions on the freedom of\r\naction of the individual members. Accordingly it was assumed that the\r\nrural Commune, being inconsistent with the modern spirit of progress,\r\nwould find no place in the new regime of liberty which was about to be\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had these ideas been announced in the Press than they\r\ncalled forth strenuous protests. In the crowd of protesters were\r\ntwo well-defined groups. On the one hand there were the so-called\r\nSlavophils, a small band of patriotic, highly educated Moscovites, who\r\nwere strongly disposed to admire everything specifically Russian, and\r\nwho habitually refused to bow the knee to the wisdom of Western Europe.\r\nThese gentlemen, in a special organ which they had recently founded,\r\npointed out to their countrymen that the Commune was a venerable and\r\npeculiarly Russian institution, which had mitigated in the past the\r\nbaneful influence of serfage, and would certainly in the future confer\r\ninestimable benefits on the emancipated peasantry. The other group was\r\nanimated by a very different spirit. They had no sympathy with national\r\npeculiarities, and no reverence for hoary antiquity. That the Commune\r\nwas specifically Russian or Slavonic, and a remnant of primitive\r\ntimes, was in their eyes anything but a recommendation in its favour.\r\nCosmopolitan in their tendencies, and absolutely free from all\r\narchaeological sentimentality, they regarded the institution from\r\nthe purely utilitarian point of view. They agreed, however, with the\r\nSlavophils in thinking that its preservation would have a beneficial\r\ninfluence on the material and moral welfare of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience it is necessary to designate this latter\r\ngroup by some definite name, but I confess I have some difficulty in\r\nmaking a choice. I do not wish to call these gentlemen Socialists,\r\nbecause many people habitually and involuntarily attach a stigma to\r\nthe word, and believe that all to whom the term is applied must be\r\nfirst-cousins to the petroleuses. To avoid misconceptions of this kind,\r\nit will be well to designate them simply by the organ which most\r\nably represented their views, and to call them the adherents of The\r\nContemporary.\r\n\r\nThe Slavophils and the adherents of The Contemporary, though differing\r\nwidely from each other in many respects, had the same immediate object\r\nin view, and accordingly worked together. With great ingenuity they\r\ncontended that the Communal system of land tenure had much greater\r\nadvantages, and was attended with much fewer inconveniences, than\r\npeople generally supposed. But they did not confine themselves to these\r\nimmediate practical advantages, which had very little interest for\r\nthe general reader. The writers in The Contemporary explained that the\r\nimportance of the rural Commune lies, not in its actual condition, but\r\nin its capabilities of development, and they drew, with prophetic eye,\r\nmost attractive pictures of the happy rural Commune of the future. Let\r\nme give here, as an illustration, one of these prophetic descriptions:\r\n\r\n\"Thanks to the spread of primary and technical education the peasants\r\nhave become well acquainted with the science of agriculture, and are\r\nalways ready to undertake in common the necessary improvements. They no\r\nlonger exhaust the soil by exporting the grain, but sell merely certain\r\ntechnical products containing no mineral ingredients. For this purpose\r\nthe Communes possess distilleries, starch-works, and the like, and the\r\nsoil thereby retains its original fertility. The scarcity induced by the\r\nnatural increase of the population is counteracted by improved methods\r\nof cultivation. If the Chinese, who know nothing of natural science,\r\nhave succeeded by purely empirical methods in perfecting agriculture to\r\nsuch an extent that a whole family can support itself on a few square\r\nyards of land, what may not the European do with the help of chemistry,\r\nbotanical physiology, and the other natural sciences?\"\r\n\r\nComing back from the possibilities of the future to the actualities of\r\nthe present, these ingenious and eloquent writers pointed out that\r\nin the rural Commune, Russia possessed a sure preventive against the\r\ngreatest evil of West-European social organisation, the Proletariat.\r\nHere the Slavophils could strike in with their favourite refrain about\r\nthe rotten social condition of Western Europe; and their temporary\r\nallies, though they habitually scoffed at the Slavophil jeremiads, had\r\nno reason for the moment to contradict them. Very soon the Proletariat\r\nbecame, for the educated classes, a species of bugbear, and the reading\r\npublic were converted to the doctrine that the Communal institutions\r\nshould be preserved as a means of excluding the monster from Russia.\r\n\r\nThis fear of what is vaguely termed the Proletariat is still frequently\r\nto be met with in Russia, and I have often taken pains to discover\r\nprecisely what is meant by the term. I cannot, however, say that my\r\nefforts have been completely successful. The monster seems to be as\r\nvague and shadowy as the awful forms which Milton placed at the gate of\r\nthe infernal regions. At one moment he seems to be simply our old enemy\r\nPauperism, but when we approach a little nearer we find that he\r\nexpands to colossal dimensions, so as to include all who do not\r\npossess inalienable landed property. In short, he turns out to be, on\r\nexamination, as vague and undefinable as a good bugbear ought to be; and\r\nthis vagueness contributed probably not a little to his success.\r\n\r\nThe influence which the idea of the Proletariat exercised on the public\r\nmind and on the legislation at the time of the Emancipation is a\r\nvery notable fact, and well worthy of attention, because it helps to\r\nillustrate a point of difference between Russians and Englishmen.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen are, as a rule, too much occupied with the multifarious\r\nconcerns of the present to look much ahead into the distant future. We\r\nprofess, indeed, to regard with horror the maxim, Apres nous le deluge!\r\nand we should probably annihilate with our virtuous indignation any one\r\nwho should boldly profess the principle. And yet we often act almost as\r\nif we were really partisans of that heartless creed. When called upon\r\nto consider the interests of the future generations, we declared\r\nthat \"sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" and stigmatise as\r\nvisionaries and dreamers all who seek to withdraw our attention from the\r\npresent. A modern Cassandra who confidently predicts the near exhaustion\r\nof our coal-fields, or graphically describes a crushing national\r\ndisaster that must some day overtake us, may attract some public\r\nattention; but when we learn that the misfortune is not to take place in\r\nour time, we placidly remark that future generations must take care\r\nof themselves, and that we cannot reasonably be expected to bear their\r\nburdens. When we are obliged to legislate, we proceed in a cautious,\r\ntentative way, and are quite satisfied with any homely, simple remedies\r\nthat common sense and experience may suggest, without taking the trouble\r\nto inquire whether the remedy adopted is in accordance with scientific\r\ntheories. In short, there is a certain truth in those \"famous prophetick\r\npictures\" spoken of by Stillingfleet, which \"represent the fate of\r\nEngland by a mole, a creature blind and busy, continually working under\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nIn Russia we find the opposite extreme. There reformers have been\r\ntrained, not in the arena of practical politics, but in the school of\r\npolitical speculation. As soon, therefore, as they begin to examine\r\nany simple matter with a view to legislation, it at once becomes\r\na \"question,\" and flies up into the region of political and social\r\nscience. Whilst we have been groping along an unexplored path, the\r\nRussians have--at least in recent times--been constantly mapping out,\r\nwith the help of foreign experience, the country that lay before them,\r\nand advancing with gigantic strides according to the newest political\r\ntheories. Men trained in this way cannot rest satisfied with homely\r\nremedies which merely alleviate the evils of the moment. They wish to\r\n\"tear up evil by the roots,\" and to legislate for future generations as\r\nwell as for themselves.\r\n\r\nThis tendency was peculiarly strong at the time of the Emancipation. The\r\neducated classes were profoundly convinced that the system of Nicholas\r\nI. had been a mistake, and that a new and brighter era was about to dawn\r\nupon the country. Everything had to be reformed. The whole social and\r\npolitical edifice had to be reconstructed on entirely new principles.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine the position of a man who, having no practical\r\nacquaintance with building, suddenly finds himself called upon to\r\nconstruct a large house, containing all the newest appliances for\r\nconvenience and comfort. What will his first step be? Probably he will\r\nproceed at once to study the latest authorities on architecture and\r\nconstruction, and when he has mastered the general principles he will\r\ncome down gradually to the details. This is precisely what the Russians\r\ndid when they found themselves called upon to reconstruct the political\r\nand social edifice. They eagerly consulted the most recent English,\r\nFrench, and German writers on social and political science, and here it\r\nwas that they made the acquaintance of the Proletariat.\r\n\r\nPeople who read books of travel without ever leaving their own country\r\nare very apt to acquire exaggerated notions regarding the hardships\r\nand dangers of uncivilised life. They read about savage tribes, daring\r\nrobbers, ferocious wild beasts, poisonous snakes, deadly fevers, and the\r\nlike; and they cannot but wonder how a human being can exist for a week\r\namong such dangers. But if they happen thereafter to visit the countries\r\ndescribed, they discover to their surprise that, though the descriptions\r\nmay not have been exaggerated, life under such conditions is much easier\r\nthan they supposed. Now the Russians who read about the Proletariat were\r\nvery much like the people who remain at home and devour books of travel.\r\nThey gained exaggerated notions, and learned to fear the Proletariat\r\nmuch more than we do, who habitually live in the midst of it. Of course\r\nit is quite possible that their view of the subject is truer than ours,\r\nand that we may some day, like the people who live tranquilly on the\r\nslopes of a volcano, be rudely awakened from our fancied security. But\r\nthis is an entirely different question. I am at present not endeavouring\r\nto justify our habitual callousness with regard to social dangers,\r\nbut simply seeking to explain why the Russians, who have little or no\r\npractical acquaintance with pauperism, should have taken such elaborate\r\nprecautions against it.\r\n\r\nBut how can the preservation of the Communal institutions lead to this\r\n\"consummation devoutly to be wished,\" and how far are the precautions\r\nlikely to be successful?\r\n\r\nThose who have studied the mysteries of social science have generally\r\ncome to the conclusion that the Proletariat has been formed chiefly by\r\nthe expropriation of the peasantry or small land-holders, and that its\r\nformation might be prevented, or at least retarded, by any system of\r\nlegislation which would secure the possession of land for the peasants\r\nand prevent them from being uprooted from the soil. Now it must be\r\nadmitted that the Russian Communal system is admirably adapted for this\r\npurpose. About one-half of the arable land has been reserved for the\r\npeasantry, and cannot be encroached on by the great landowners or the\r\ncapitalists, and every adult peasant, roughly speaking, has a right to\r\na share of this land. When I have said that the peasantry compose about\r\nfive-sixths of the population, and that it is extremely difficult for\r\na peasant to sever his connection with the rural Commune, it will be at\r\nonce evident that, if the theories of social philosophers are correct,\r\nand if the sanguine expectations entertained in many quarters regarding\r\nthe permanence of the present Communal institutions are destined to be\r\nrealised, there is little or no danger of a numerous Proletariat being\r\nformed, and the Russians are justified in maintaining, as they often do,\r\nthat they have successfully solved one of the most important and most\r\ndifficult of social problems.\r\n\r\nBut is there any reasonable chance of these sanguine expectations being\r\nrealised?\r\n\r\nThis is, doubtless, a most complicated and difficult question, but it\r\ncannot be shirked. However sceptical we may be with regard to social\r\npanaceas of all sorts, we cannot dismiss with a few hackneyed phrases a\r\ngigantic experiment in social science involving the material and moral\r\nwelfare of many millions of human beings. On the other hand, I do not\r\nwish to exhaust the reader\u0027s patience by a long series of multifarious\r\ndetails and conflicting arguments. What I propose to do, therefore, is\r\nto state in a few words the conclusions at which I have arrived, after a\r\ncareful study of the question in all its bearings, and to indicate in a\r\ngeneral way how I have arrived at these conclusions.\r\n\r\nIf Russia were content to remain a purely agricultural country of\r\nthe Sleepy Hollow type, and if her Government were to devote all its\r\nenergies to maintaining economic and social stagnation, the rural\r\nCommune might perhaps prevent the formation of a large Proletariat in\r\nthe future, as it has tended to prevent it for centuries in the past.\r\nThe periodical redistributions of the Communal land would secure to\r\nevery family a portion of the soil, and when the population became too\r\ndense, the evils arising from inordinate subdivision of the land\r\nmight be obviated by a carefully regulated system of emigration to\r\nthe outlying, thinly populated provinces. All this sounds very well\r\nin theory, but experience is proving that it cannot be carried out in\r\npractice. In Russia, as in Western Europe, the struggle for life, even\r\namong the conservative agricultural classes, is becoming yearly more\r\nand more intense, and is producing both the desire and the necessity for\r\ngreater freedom of individual character and effort, so that each man may\r\nmake his way in the world according to the amount of his intelligence,\r\nenergy, spirit of enterprise, and tenacity of purpose. Whatever\r\ninstitutions tend to fetter the individual and maintain a dead level\r\nof mediocrity have little chance of subsisting for any great length of\r\ntime, and it must be admitted that among such institutions the rural\r\nCommune in its present form occupies a prominent place. All its members\r\nmust possess, in principle if not always in practice, an equal share of\r\nthe soil and must practice the same methods of agriculture, and when a\r\ncertain inequality has been created by individual effort it is in great\r\nmeasure wiped out by a redistribution of the Communal land.\r\n\r\nNow, I am well aware that in practice the injustice and inconveniences\r\nof the system, being always tempered and corrected by ingenious\r\ncompromises suggested by long experience, are not nearly so great as the\r\nmere theorist might naturally suppose; but they are, I believe, quite\r\ngreat enough to prevent the permanent maintenance of the institution,\r\nand already there are ominous indications of the coming change, as I\r\nshall explain more fully when I come to deal with the consequences of\r\nserf-emancipation. On the other hand there is no danger of a sudden,\r\ngeneral abolition of the old system. Though the law now permits the\r\ntransition from Communal to personal hereditary tenure, even the\r\nprogressive enterprising peasants are slow to avail themselves of the\r\npermission; and the reason I once heard given for this conservative\r\ntendency is worth recording. A well-to-do peasant who had been in the\r\nhabit of manuring his land better than his neighbours, and who was,\r\nconsequently, a loser by the existing system, said to me: \"Of course I\r\nwant to keep the allotment I have got. But if the land is never again\r\nto be divided my grandchildren may be beggars. We must not sin against\r\nthose who are to come after us.\" This unexpected reply gave me food\r\nfor reflection. Surely those muzhiks who are so often accused of being\r\nbrutally indifferent to moral obligations must have peculiar deep-rooted\r\nmoral conceptions of their own which exercise a great influence on their\r\ndaily life. A man who hesitates to sin against his grandchildren still\r\nunborn, though his conceptions of the meum and the tuum in the present\r\nmay be occasionally a little confused, must possess somewhere deep down\r\nin his nature a secret fund of moral feeling of a very respectable kind.\r\nEven among the educated classes in Russia the way of looking at these\r\nmatters is very different from ours. We should naturally feel inclined\r\nto applaud, encourage, and assist the peasants who show energy and\r\ninitiative, and who try to rise above their fellows. To the Russian\r\nthis seems at once inexpedient and immoral. The success of the few, he\r\nexplains, is always obtained at the expense of the many, and generally\r\nby means which the severe moralist cannot approve of. The rich peasants,\r\nfor example, have gained their fortune and influence by demoralising\r\nand exploiting their weaker brethren, by committing all manner of\r\nillegalities, and by bribing the local authorities. Hence they are\r\nstyled Miroyedy (Commune-devourers) or Kulaki (fists), or something\r\nequally uncomplimentary. Once this view is adopted, it follows logically\r\nthat the Communal institutions, in so far as they form a barrier to the\r\nactivity of such persons, ought to be carefully preserved. This idea\r\nunderlies nearly all the arguments in favour of the Commune, and\r\nexplains why they are so popular. Russians of all classes have, in fact,\r\na leaning towards socialistic notions, and very little sympathy with our\r\nbelief in individual initiative and unrestricted competition.\r\n\r\nEven if it be admitted that the Commune may effectually prevent the\r\nformation of an agricultural Proletariat, the question is thereby\r\nonly half answered. Russia aspires to become a great industrial and\r\ncommercial country, and accordingly her town population is rapidly\r\naugmenting. We have still to consider, then, how the Commune affects\r\nthe Proletariat of the towns. In Western Europe the great centres of\r\nindustry have uprooted from the soil and collected in the towns a great\r\npart of the rural population. Those who yielded to this attractive\r\ninfluence severed all connection with their native villages, became\r\nunfit for field labour, and were transformed into artisans or\r\nfactory-workers. In Russia this transformation could not easily take\r\nplace. The peasant might work during the greater part of his life in\r\nthe towns, but he did not thereby sever his connection with his native\r\nvillage. He remained, whether he desired it or not, a member of the\r\nCommune, possessing a share of the Communal land, and liable for a share\r\nof the Communal burdens. During his residence in the town his wife\r\nand family remained at home, and thither he himself sooner or\r\nlater returned. In this way a class of hybrids--half-peasants,\r\nhalf-artisans--has been created, and the formation of a town Proletariat\r\nhas been greatly retarded.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this hybrid class is commonly cited as a beneficent\r\nresult of the Communal institutions. The artisans and factory labourers,\r\nit is said, have thus always a home to which they can retire when thrown\r\nout of work or overtaken by old age, and their children are brought\r\nup in the country, instead of being reared among the debilitating\r\ninfluences of overcrowded cities. Every common labourer has, in\r\nshort, by this ingenious contrivance, some small capital and a country\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\nIn the present transitional state of Russian society this peculiar\r\narrangement is at once natural and convenient, but amidst its advantages\r\nit has many serious defects. The unnatural separation of the artisan\r\nfrom his wife and family leads to very undesirable results, well known\r\nto all who are familiar with the details of peasant life in the northern\r\nprovinces. And whatever its advantages and defects may be, it cannot be\r\npermanently retained. At the present time native industry is still in\r\nits infancy. Protected by the tariff from foreign competition, and too\r\nfew in number to produce a strong competition among themselves, the\r\nexisting factories can give to their owners a large revenue without any\r\nstrenuous exertion. Manufacturers can therefore allow themselves many\r\nlittle liberties, which would be quite inadmissible if the price of\r\nmanufactured goods were lowered by brisk competition. Ask a Lancashire\r\nmanufacturer if he could allow a large portion of his workers to go\r\nyearly to Cornwall or Caithness to mow a field of hay or reap a few\r\nacres of wheat or oats! And if Russia is to make great industrial\r\nprogress, the manufacturers of Moscow, Lodz, Ivanovo, and Shui will\r\nsome day be as hard pressed as are those of Bradford and Manchester. The\r\ninvariable tendency of modern industry, and the secret of its progress,\r\nis the ever-increasing division of labour; and how can this principle be\r\napplied if the artisans insist on remaining agriculturists?\r\n\r\nThe interests of agriculture, too, are opposed to the old system.\r\nAgriculture cannot be expected to make progress, or even to be tolerably\r\nproductive, if it is left in great measure to women and children. At\r\npresent it is not desirable that the link which binds the factory-worker\r\nor artisan with the village should be at once severed, for in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the large factories there is often no proper\r\naccommodation for the families of the workers, and agriculture, as at\r\npresent practised, can be carried on successfully though the Head of\r\nthe Household happens to be absent. But the system must be regarded as\r\nsimply temporary, and the disruption of large families--a phenomenon\r\nof which I have already spoken--renders its application more and more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFINNISH AND TARTAR VILLAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nA Finnish Tribe--Finnish Villages--Various Stages of\r\nRussification--Finnish Women--Finnish Religions--Method of \"Laying\"\r\nGhosts--Curious Mixture of Christianity and Paganism--Conversion of\r\nthe Finns--A Tartar Village--A Russian Peasant\u0027s Conception of\r\nMahometanism--A Mahometan\u0027s View of Christianity--Propaganda--The\r\nRussian Colonist--Migrations of Peoples During the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen talking one day with a landed proprietor who lived near Ivanofka,\r\nI accidentally discovered that in a district at some distance to the\r\nnortheast there were certain villages the inhabitants of which did not\r\nunderstand Russian, and habitually used a peculiar language of their\r\nown. With an illogical hastiness worthy of a genuine ethnologist, I at\r\nonce assumed that these must be the remnants of some aboriginal race.\r\n\r\n\"Des aborigenes!\" I exclaimed, unable to recall the Russian equivalent\r\nfor the term, and knowing that my friend understood French. \"Doubtless\r\nthe remains of some ancient race who formerly held the country, and are\r\nnow rapidly disappearing. Have you any Aborigines Protection Society in\r\nthis part of the world?\"\r\n\r\nMy friend had evidently great difficulty in imagining what an Aborigines\r\nProtection Society could be, and promptly assured me that there was\r\nnothing of the kind in Russia. On being told that such a society might\r\nrender valuable services by protecting the weaker against the stronger\r\nrace, and collecting important materials for the new science of Social\r\nEmbryology, he looked thoroughly mystified. As to the new science,\r\nhe had never heard of it, and as to protection, he thought that the\r\ninhabitants of the villages in question were quite capable of protecting\r\nthemselves. \"I could invent,\" he added, with a malicious smile, \"a\r\nsociety for the protection of ALL peasants, but I am quite sure that the\r\nauthorities would not allow me to carry out my idea.\"\r\n\r\nMy ethnological curiosity was thoroughly aroused, and I endeavoured to\r\nawaken a similar feeling in my friend by hinting that we had at hand a\r\npromising field for discoveries which might immortalise the fortunate\r\nexplorers; but my efforts were in vain. The old gentleman was a portly,\r\nindolent man, of phlegmatic temperament, who thought more of comfort\r\nthan of immortality in the terrestrial sense of the term. To my proposal\r\nthat we should start at once on an exploring expedition, he replied\r\ncalmly that the distance was considerable, that the roads were muddy,\r\nand that there was nothing to be learned. The villages in question were\r\nvery like other villages, and their inhabitants lived, to all intents\r\nand purposes, in the same way as their Russian neighbours. If they had\r\nany secret peculiarities they would certainly not divulge them to\r\na stranger, for they were notoriously silent, gloomy, morose, and\r\nuncommunicative. Everything that was known about them, my friend assured\r\nme, might be communicated in a few words. They belonged to a Finnish\r\ntribe called Korelli, and had been transported to their present\r\nsettlements in comparatively recent times. In answer to my questions as\r\nto how, when, and by whom they had been transported thither my informant\r\nreplied that it had been the work of Ivan the Terrible.\r\n\r\nThough I knew at that time little of Russian history, I suspected that\r\nthe last assertion was invented on the spur of the moment, in order to\r\nsatisfy my troublesome curiosity, and accordingly I determined not\r\nto accept it without verification. The result showed how careful\r\nthe traveller should be in accepting the testimony of \"intelligent,\r\nwell-informed natives.\" On further investigation I discovered, not only\r\nthat the story about Ivan the Terrible was a pure invention--whether of\r\nmy friend or of the popular imagination, which always uses heroic names\r\nas pegs on which to hang traditions, I know not--but also that my first\r\ntheory was correct. These Finnish peasants turned out to be a remnant\r\nof the aborigines, or at least of the oldest known inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict. Men of the same race, but bearing different tribal names,\r\nsuch as Finns, Korelli, Tcheremiss, Tchuvash, Mordva, Votyaks, Permyaks,\r\nZyryanye, Voguls, are to be found in considerable numbers all over the\r\nnorthern provinces, from the Gulf of Bothnia to Western Siberia, as well\r\nas in the provinces bordering the Middle Volga as far south as Penza,\r\nSimbirsk, and Tamboff.* The Russian peasants, who now compose the great\r\nmass of the population, are the intruders.\r\n\r\n     * The semi-official \"Statesman\u0027s Handbook for Russia,\"\r\n     published in 1896, enumerates fourteen different tribes,\r\n     with an aggregate of about 4,650,000 souls, but these\r\n     numbers must not be regarded as having any pretensions to\r\n     accuracy.  The best authorities differ widely in their\r\n     estimates.\r\n\r\nI had long taken a deep interest in what learned Germans call the\r\nVolkerwanderung--that is to say, the migrations of peoples during the\r\ngradual dissolution of the Roman Empire, and it had often occurred to me\r\nthat the most approved authorities, who had expended an infinite\r\namount of learning on the subject, had not always taken the trouble to\r\ninvestigate the nature of the process. It is not enough to know that\r\na race or tribe extended its dominions or changed its geographical\r\nposition. We ought at the same time to inquire whether it expelled,\r\nexterminated, or absorbed the former inhabitants, and how the expulsion,\r\nextermination, or absorption was effected. Now of these three processes,\r\nabsorption may have been more frequent than is commonly supposed, and it\r\nseemed to me that in Northern Russia this process might be conveniently\r\nstudied. A thousand years ago the whole of Northern Russia was peopled\r\nby Finnish pagan tribes, and at the present day the greater part of it\r\nis occupied by peasants who speak the language of Moscow, profess the\r\nOrthodox faith, present in their physiognomy no striking peculiarities,\r\nand appear to the superficial observer pure Russians. And we have\r\nno reason to suppose that the former inhabitants were expelled or\r\nexterminated, or that they gradually died out from contact with the\r\ncivilisation and vices of a higher race. History records no\r\nwholesale Finnish migrations like that of the Kalmyks, and no war of\r\nextermination; and statistics prove that among the remnants of those\r\nprimitive races the population increases as rapidly as among the Russian\r\npeasantry.* From these facts I concluded that the Finnish aborigines had\r\nbeen simply absorbed, or rather, were being absorbed, by the Slavonic\r\nintruders.\r\n\r\n     * This latter statement is made on the authority of Popoff\r\n     (\"Zyryanye i zyryanski krai,\" Moscow, 1874) and\r\n     Tcheremshanski (\"Opisanie Orenburgskoi Gubernii,\" Ufa,\r\n     1859).\r\n\r\nThis conclusion has since been confirmed by observation. During my\r\nwanderings in these northern provinces I have found villages in every\r\nstage of Russification. In one, everything seemed thoroughly Finnish:\r\nthe inhabitants had a reddish-olive skin, very high cheek-bones,\r\nobliquely set eyes, and a peculiar costume; none of the women, and very\r\nfew of the men, could understand Russian, and any Russian who visited\r\nthe place was regarded as a foreigner. In a second, there were already\r\nsome Russian inhabitants; the others had lost something of their pure\r\nFinnish type, many of the men had discarded the old costume and spoke\r\nRussian fluently, and a Russian visitor was no longer shunned. In a\r\nthird, the Finnish type was still further weakened: all the men spoke\r\nRussian, and nearly all the women understood it; the old male costume\r\nhad entirely disappeared, and the old female costume was rapidly\r\nfollowing it; while intermarriage with the Russian population was no\r\nlonger rare. In a fourth, intermarriage had almost completely done its\r\nwork, and the old Finnish element could be detected merely in certain\r\npeculiarities of physiognomy and pronunciation.*\r\n\r\n     * One of the most common peculiarities of pronunciation is\r\n     the substitution of the sound of ts for that of tch, which I\r\n     found almost universal over a large area.\r\n\r\nThe process of Russification may be likewise observed in the manner of\r\nbuilding the houses and in the methods of farming, which show plainly\r\nthat the Finnish races did not obtain rudimentary civilisation from the\r\nSlavs. Whence, then, was it derived? Was it obtained from some other\r\nrace, or is it indigenous? These are questions which I have no means of\r\nanswering.\r\n\r\nA Positivist poet--or if that be a contradiction in terms, let us say\r\na Positivist who wrote verses--once composed an appeal to the fair sex,\r\nbeginning with the words:\r\n\r\n\"Pourquoi, O femmes, restez-vous en arriere?\"\r\n\r\nThe question might have been addressed to the women in these Finnish\r\nvillages. Like their sisters in France, they are much more conservative\r\nthan the men, and oppose much more stubbornly the Russian influence.\r\nOn the other hand, like women in general, when they do begin to change,\r\nthey change more rapidly. This is seen especially in the matter of\r\ncostume. The men adopt the Russian costume very gradually; the women\r\nadopt it at once. As soon as a single woman gets a gaudy Russian dress,\r\nevery other woman in the village feels envious and impatient till she\r\nhas done likewise. I remember once visiting a Mordva village when this\r\ncritical point had been reached, and a very characteristic incident\r\noccurred. In the preceding villages through which I had passed I had\r\ntried in vain to buy a female costume, and I again made the attempt.\r\nThis time the result was very different. A few minutes after I had\r\nexpressed my wish to purchase a costume, the house in which I was\r\nsitting was besieged by a great crowd of women, holding in their hands\r\narticles of wearing apparel. In order to make a selection I went out\r\ninto the crowd, but the desire to find a purchaser was so general and\r\nso ardent that I was regularly mobbed. The women, shouting \"Kupi! kupi!\"\r\n(\"Buy! buy!\"), and struggling with each other to get near me, were so\r\nimportunate that I had at last to take refuge in the house, to prevent\r\nmy own costume from being torn to shreds. But even there I was not\r\nsafe, for the women followed at my heels, and a considerable amount of\r\ngood-natured violence had to be employed to expel the intruders.\r\n\r\nIt is especially interesting to observe the transformation of\r\nnationality in the sphere of religious conceptions. The Finns remained\r\npagans long after the Russians had become Christians, but at the present\r\ntime the whole population, from the eastern boundary of Finland proper\r\nto the Ural Mountains, are officially described as members of the\r\nGreek Orthodox Church. The manner in which this change of religion was\r\neffected is well worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nThe old religion of the Finnish tribes, if we may judge from the\r\nfragments which still remain, had, like the people themselves, a\r\nthoroughly practical, prosaic character. Their theology consisted not of\r\nabstract dogmas, but merely of simple prescriptions for the ensuring\r\nof material welfare. Even at the present day, in the districts not\r\ncompletely Russified, their prayers are plain, unadorned requests for\r\na good harvest, plenty of cattle, and the like, and are expressed in a\r\ntone of childlike familiarity that sounds strange in our ears. They\r\nmake no attempt to veil their desires with mystic solemnity, but ask, in\r\nsimple, straightforward fashion, that God should make the barley ripen\r\nand the cow calve successfully, that He should prevent their horses from\r\nbeing stolen, and that he should help them to gain money to pay their\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nTheir religious ceremonies have, so far as I have been able to discover,\r\nno hidden mystical signification, and are for the most part rather\r\nmagical rites for averting the influence of malicious spirits,\r\nor freeing themselves from the unwelcome visits of their departed\r\nrelatives. For this latter purpose many even of those who are officially\r\nChristians proceed at stated seasons to the graveyards and place an\r\nabundant supply of cooked food on the graves of their relations who have\r\nrecently died, requesting the departed to accept this meal, and not to\r\nreturn to their old homes, where their presence is no longer desired.\r\nThough more of the food is eaten at night by the village dogs than\r\nby the famished spirits, the custom is believed to have a powerful\r\ninfluence in preventing the dead from wandering about at night and\r\nfrightening the living. If it be true, as I am inclined to believe, that\r\ntombstones were originally used for keeping the dead in their graves,\r\nthen it must be admitted that in the matter of \"laying\" ghosts the\r\nFinns have shown themselves much more humane than other races. It\r\nmay, however, be suggested that in the original home of the Finns--\"le\r\nberceau de la race,\" as French ethnologists say--stones could not easily\r\nbe procured, and that the custom of feeding the dead was adopted as a\r\npis aller. The decision of the question must be left to those who know\r\nwhere the original home of the Finns was.\r\n\r\nAs the Russian peasantry, knowing little or nothing of theology, and\r\nplacing implicit confidence in rites and ceremonies, did not differ very\r\nwidely from the pagan Finns in the matter of religious conceptions, the\r\nfriendly contact of the two races naturally led to a curious blending of\r\nthe two religions. The Russians adopted many customs from the Finns,\r\nand the Finns adopted still more from the Russians. When Yumala and the\r\nother Finnish deities did not do as they were desired, their worshippers\r\nnaturally applied for protection or assistance to the Madonna and the\r\n\"Russian God.\" If their own traditional magic rites did not suffice to\r\nward off evil influences, they naturally tried the effect of crossing\r\nthemselves, as the Russians do in moments of danger. All this may seem\r\nstrange to us who have been taught from our earliest years that religion\r\nis something quite different from spells, charms, and incantations, and\r\nthat of all the various religions in the world one alone is true, all\r\nthe others being false. But we must remember that the Finns have had a\r\nvery different education. They do not distinguish religion from magic\r\nrites, and they have never been taught that other religions are less\r\ntrue than their own. For them the best religion is the one which\r\ncontains the most potent spells, and they see no reason why less\r\npowerful religions should not be blended therewith. Their deities are\r\nnot jealous gods, and do not insist on having a monopoly of devotion;\r\nand in any case they cannot do much injury to those who have placed\r\nthemselves under the protection of a more powerful divinity.\r\n\r\nThis simple-minded eclecticism often produces a singular mixture of\r\nChristianity and paganism. Thus, for instance, at the harvest festivals,\r\nTchuvash peasants have been known to pray first to their own deities,\r\nand then to St. Nicholas, the miracle-worker, who is the favourite\r\nsaint of the Russian peasantry. Such dual worship is sometimes\r\neven recommended by the Yomzi--a class of men who correspond to the\r\nmedicine-men among the Red Indians--and the prayers are on these\r\noccasions couched in the most familiar terms. Here is a specimen given\r\nby a Russian who has specially studied the language and customs of this\r\ninteresting people:* \"Look here, O Nicholas-god! Perhaps my neighbour,\r\nlittle Michael, has been slandering me to you, or perhaps he will do\r\nso. If he does, don\u0027t believe him. I have done him no ill, and wish him\r\nnone. He is a worthless boaster and a babbler. He does not really honour\r\nyou, and merely plays the hypocrite. But I honour you from my heart;\r\nand, behold, I place a taper before you!\" Sometimes incidents occur\r\nwhich display a still more curious blending of the two religions. Thus\r\na Tcheremiss, on one occasion, in consequence of a serious illness,\r\nsacrificed a young foal to our Lady of Kazan!\r\n\r\n     * Mr. Zolotnitski, \"Tchuvasko-russki slovar,\" p. 167.\r\n\r\nThough the Finnish beliefs affected to some extent the Russian\r\npeasantry, the Russian faith ultimately prevailed. This can be\r\nexplained without taking into consideration the inherent superiority\r\nof Christianity over all forms of paganism. The Finns had no organised\r\npriesthood, and consequently never offered a systematic opposition to\r\nthe new faith; the Russians, on the contrary, had a regular hierarchy in\r\nclose alliance with the civil administration. In the principal villages\r\nChristian churches were built, and some of the police-officers vied with\r\nthe ecclesiastical officials in the work of making converts. At the same\r\ntime there were other influences tending in the same direction. If\r\na Russian practised Finnish superstitions he exposed himself to\r\ndisagreeable consequences of a temporal kind; if, on the contrary, a\r\nFinn adopted the Christian religion, the temporal consequences that\r\ncould result were all advantageous to him.\r\n\r\nMany of the Finns gradually became Christians almost unconsciously. The\r\necclesiastical authorities were extremely moderate in their demands.\r\nThey insisted on no religious knowledge, and merely demanded that the\r\nconverts should be baptised. The converts, failing to understand the\r\nspiritual significance of the ceremony, commonly offered no resistance,\r\nso long as the immersion was performed in summer. So little repugnance,\r\nindeed, did they feel, that on some occasions, when a small reward\r\nwas given to those who consented, some of the new converts wished the\r\nceremony to be repeated several times. The chief objection to receiving\r\nthe Christian faith lay in the long and severe fasts imposed by the\r\nGreek Orthodox Church; but this difficulty was overcome by assuming that\r\nthey need not be strictly observed. At first, in some districts, it was\r\npopularly believed that the Icons informed the Russian priests against\r\nthose who did not fast as the Church prescribed; but experience\r\ngradually exploded this theory. Some of the more prudent converts,\r\nhowever, to prevent all possible tale-telling, took the precaution of\r\nturning the face of the Icon to the wall when prohibited meats were\r\nabout to be eaten!\r\n\r\nThis gradual conversion of the Finnish tribes, effected without any\r\nintellectual revolution in the minds of the converts, had very important\r\ntemporal consequences. Community of faith led to intermarriage, and\r\nintermarriage led rapidly to the blending of the two races.\r\n\r\nIf we compare a Finnish village in any stage of Russification with a\r\nTartar village, of which the inhabitants are Mahometans, we cannot fail\r\nto be struck by the contrast. In the latter, though there may be many\r\nRussians, there is no blending of the two races. Between them religion\r\nhas raised an impassable barrier. There are many villages in the eastern\r\nand north-eastern provinces of European Russia which have been for\r\ngenerations half Tartar and half Russian, and the amalgamation of\r\nthe two nationalities has not yet begun. Near the one end stands the\r\nChristian church, and near the other stands the little metchet, or\r\nMahometan house of prayer. The whole village forms one Commune, with one\r\nVillage Assembly and one Village Elder; but, socially, it is composed\r\nof two distinct communities, each possessing its peculiar customs and\r\npeculiar mode of life. The Tartar may learn Russian, but he does not on\r\nthat account become Russianised.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the two races are imbued with\r\nfanatical hatred towards each other. On the contrary, they live in\r\nperfect good-fellowship, elect as Village Elder sometimes a Russian\r\nand sometimes a Tartar, and discuss the Communal affairs in the Village\r\nAssembly without reference to religious matters. I know one village\r\nwhere the good-fellowship went even a step farther: the Christians\r\ndetermined to repair their church, and the Mahometans helped them to\r\ntransport wood for the purpose! All this tends to show that under a\r\ntolerably good Government, which does not favour one race at the expense\r\nof the other, Mahometan Tartars and Christian Slavs can live peaceably\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe absence of fanaticism and of that proselytising zeal which is one of\r\nthe most prolific sources of religious hatred, is to be explained by\r\nthe peculiar religious conceptions of these peasants. In their\r\nminds religion and nationality are so closely allied as to be almost\r\nidentical. The Russian is, as it were, by nature a Christian, and the\r\nTartar a Mahometan; and it never occurs to any one in these villages\r\nto disturb the appointed order of nature. On this subject I had once an\r\ninteresting conversation with a Russian peasant who had been for some\r\ntime living among Tartars. In reply to my question as to what kind of\r\npeople the Tartars were, he replied laconically, \"Nitchevo\"--that is to\r\nsay, \"nothing in particular\"; and on being pressed for a more definite\r\nexpression of opinion, he admitted that they were very good people\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n\"And what kind of faith have they?\" I continued.\r\n\r\n\"A good enough faith,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\"Is it better than the faith of the Molokanye?\" The Molokanye are\r\nRussian sectarians--closely resembling Scotch Presbyterians--of whom I\r\nshall have more to say in the sequel.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is better than the Molokan faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" I exclaimed, endeavouring to conceal my astonishment at this\r\nstrange judgment. \"Are the Molokanye, then, very bad people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. The Molokanye are good and honest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, do you think their faith is so much worse than that of the\r\nMahometans?\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall I tell you?\" The peasant here paused as if to collect his\r\nthoughts, and then proceeded slowly, \"The Tartars, you see, received\r\ntheir faith from God as they received the colour of their skins, but\r\nthe Molokanye are Russians who have invented a faith out of their own\r\nheads!\"\r\n\r\nThis singular answer scarcely requires a commentary. As it would be\r\nabsurd to try to make Tartars change the colour of their skins, so it\r\nwould be absurd to try to make them change their religion. Besides this,\r\nsuch an attempt would be an unjustifiable interference with the designs\r\nof Providence, for, in the peasant\u0027s opinion, God gave Mahometanism to\r\nthe Tartars just as he gave the Orthodox faith to the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical authorities do not formally adopt this strange\r\ntheory, but they generally act in accordance with it. There is little\r\nofficial propaganda among the Mahometan subjects of the Tsar, and it is\r\nwell that it is so, for an energetic propaganda would lead merely to\r\nthe stirring up of any latent hostility which may exist deep down in the\r\nnature of the two races, and it would not make any real converts. The\r\nTartars cannot unconsciously imbibe Christianity as the Finns have done.\r\nTheir religion is not a rude, simple paganism without theology in\r\nthe scholastic sense of the term, but a monotheism as exclusive as\r\nChristianity itself. Enter into conversation with an intelligent man\r\nwho has no higher religious belief than a rude sort of paganism, and you\r\nmay, if you know him well and make a judicious use of your knowledge,\r\neasily interest him in the touching story of Christ\u0027s life and teaching.\r\nAnd in these unsophisticated natures there is but one step from interest\r\nand sympathy to conversion.\r\n\r\nTry the same method with a Mussulman, and you will soon find that all\r\nyour efforts are fruitless. He has already a theology and a prophet of\r\nhis own, and sees no reason why he should exchange them for those which\r\nyou have to offer. Perhaps he will show you more or less openly that he\r\npities your ignorance and wonders that you have not been able to ADVANCE\r\nfrom Christianity to Mahometanism. In his opinion--I am supposing that\r\nhe is a man of education--Moses and Christ were great prophets in their\r\nday, and consequently he is accustomed to respect their memory; but he\r\nis profoundly convinced that however appropriate they were for their own\r\ntimes, they have been entirely superseded by Mahomet, precisely as\r\nwe believe that Judaism was superseded by Christianity. Proud of his\r\nsuperior knowledge, he regards you as a benighted polytheist, and may\r\nperhaps tell you that the Orthodox Christians with whom he comes in\r\ncontact have three Gods and a host of lesser deities called saints, that\r\nthey pray to idols called Icons, and that they keep their holy days by\r\ngetting drunk. In vain you endeavour to explain to him that saints\r\nand Icons are not essential parts of Christianity, and that habits of\r\nintoxication have no religious significance. On these points he may make\r\nconcessions to you, but the doctrine of the Trinity remains for him a\r\nfatal stumbling-block. \"You Christians,\" he will say, \"once had a great\r\nprophet called Jisous, who is mentioned with respect in the Koran, but\r\nyou falsified your sacred writings and took to worshipping him, and\r\nnow you declare that he is the equal of Allah. Far from us be such\r\nblasphemy! There is but one God, and Mahomet is His prophet.\"\r\n\r\nA worthy Christian missionary, who had laboured long and zealously among\r\na Mussulman population, once called me sharply to account for having\r\nexpressed the opinion that Mahometans are very rarely converted to\r\nChristianity. When I brought him down from the region of vague general\r\nstatements and insisted on knowing how many cases he had met with in his\r\nown personal experience during sixteen years of missionary work, he was\r\nconstrained to admit that he had know only one: and when I pressed him\r\nfarther as to the disinterested sincerity of the convert in question his\r\nreply was not altogether satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe policy of religious non-intervention has not always been practised\r\nby the Government. Soon after the conquest of the Khanate of Kazan in\r\nthe sixteenth century, the Tsars of Muscovy attempted to convert their\r\nnew subjects from Mahometanism to Christianity. The means employed were\r\npartly spiritual and partly administrative, but the police-officers\r\nseem to have played a more important part than the clergy. In this way\r\na certain number of Tartars were baptised; but the authorities were\r\nobliged to admit that the new converts \"shamelessly retain many horrid\r\nTartar customs, and neither hold nor know the Christian faith.\" When\r\nspiritual exhortations failed, the Government ordered its officials to\r\n\"pacify, imprison, put in irons, and thereby UNTEACH and frighten from\r\nthe Tartar faith those who, though baptised, do not obey the admonitions\r\nof the Metropolitan.\" These energetic measures proved as ineffectual\r\nas the spiritual exhortations; and Catherine II. adopted a new\r\nmethod, highly characteristic of her system of administration. The new\r\nconverts--who, be it remembered, were unable to read and write--were\r\nordered by Imperial ukaz to sign a written promise to the effect that\r\n\"they would completely forsake their infidel errors, and, avoiding all\r\nintercourse with unbelievers, would hold firmly and unwaveringly the\r\nChristian faith and its dogmas\"*--of which latter, we may add, they had\r\nnot the slightest knowledge. The childlike faith in the magical efficacy\r\nof stamped paper here displayed was not justified. The so-called\r\n\"baptised Tartars\" are at the present time as far from being Christians\r\nas they were in the sixteenth century. They cannot openly profess\r\nMahometanism, because men who have been once formally admitted into\r\nthe National Church cannot leave it without exposing themselves to\r\nthe severe pains and penalties of the criminal code, but they strongly\r\nobject to be Christianised.\r\n\r\n     * \"Ukaz Kazanskoi dukhovnoi Konsistorii.\"  Anno 1778.\r\n\r\nOn this subject I have found a remarkable admission in a semiofficial\r\narticle, published as recently as 1872.* \"It is a fact worthy of\r\nattention,\" says the writer, \"that a long series of evident apostasies\r\ncoincides with the beginning of measures to confirm the converts in\r\nthe Christian faith. There must be, therefore, some collateral cause\r\nproducing those cases of apostasy precisely at the moment when the\r\ncontrary might be expected.\" There is a delightful naivete in this\r\nway of stating the fact. The mysterious cause vaguely indicated is not\r\ndifficult to find. So long as the Government demanded merely that the\r\nsupposed converts should be inscribed as Christians in the official\r\nregisters, there was no official apostasy; but as soon as active\r\nmeasures began to be taken \"to confirm the converts,\" a spirit of\r\nhostility and fanaticism appeared among the Mussulman population, and\r\nmade those who were inscribed as Christians resist the propaganda.\r\n\r\n     * \"Zhurnal Ministerstva Narodnago Prosveshtcheniya.\"  June,\r\n     1872.\r\n\r\nIt may safely be said that Christians are impervious to Islam, and\r\ngenuine Mussulmans impervious to Christianity; but between the two there\r\nare certain tribes, or fractions of tribes, which present a promising\r\nfield for missionary enterprise. In this field the Tartars show much\r\nmore zeal than the Russians, and possess certain advantages over their\r\nrivals. The tribes of Northeastern Russia learn Tartar much more easily\r\nthan Russian, and their geographical position and modes of life\r\nbring them in contact with Russians much less than with Tartars. The\r\nconsequence is that whole villages of Tcheremiss and Votiaks, officially\r\ninscribed as belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church, have openly\r\ndeclared themselves Mahometans; and some of the more remarkable\r\nconversions have been commemorated by popular songs, which are sung\r\nby young and old. Against this propaganda the Orthodox ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities do little or nothing. Though the criminal code contains\r\nsevere enactments against those who fall away from the Orthodox Church,\r\nand still more against those who produce apostasy,* the enactments are\r\nrarely put in force. Both clergy and laity in the Russian Church are,\r\nas a rule, very tolerant where no political questions are involved. The\r\nparish priest pays attention to apostasy only when it diminishes his\r\nannual revenues, and this can be easily avoided by the apostate\u0027s paying\r\na small yearly sum. If this precaution be taken, whole villages may be\r\nconverted to Islam without the higher ecclesiastical authorities knowing\r\nanything of the matter.\r\n\r\n     * A person convicted of converting a Christian to Islamism\r\n     is sentenced, according to the criminal code (§184), to the\r\n     loss of all civil rights, and to imprisonment with hard\r\n     labour for a term varying from eight to ten years.\r\n\r\nWhether the barrier that separates Christians and Mussulmans in Russia,\r\nas elsewhere, will ever be broken down by education, I do not know; but\r\nI may remark that hitherto the spread of education among the Tartars\r\nhas tended rather to imbue them with fanaticism. If we remember that\r\ntheological education always produces intolerance, and that Tartar\r\neducation is almost exclusively theological, we shall not be surprised\r\nto find that a Tartar\u0027s religious fanaticism is generally in direct\r\nproportion to the amount of his intellectual culture. The unlettered\r\nTartar, unspoiled by learning falsely so called, and knowing merely\r\nenough of his religion to perform the customary ordinances prescribed by\r\nthe Prophet, is peaceable, kindly, and hospitable towards all men; but\r\nthe learned Tartar, who has been taught that the Christian is a kiafir\r\n(infidel) and a mushrik (polytheist), odious in the sight of Allah, and\r\nalready condemned to eternal punishment, is as intolerant and fanatical\r\nas the most bigoted Roman Catholic or Calvinist. Such fanatics are\r\noccasionally to be met with in the eastern provinces, but they are\r\nfew in number, and have little influence on the masses. From my own\r\nexperience I can testify that during the whole course of my wanderings\r\nI have nowhere received more kindness and hospitality than among the\r\nuneducated Mussulman Bashkirs. Even here, however, Islam opposes a\r\nstrong barrier to Russification.\r\n\r\nThough no such barrier existed among the pagan Finnish tribes, the work\r\nof Russification among them is still, as I have already indicated, far\r\nfrom complete. Not only whole villages, but even many entire districts,\r\nare still very little affected by Russian influence. This is to be\r\nexplained partly by geographical conditions. In regions which have a\r\npoor soil, and are intersected by no navigable river, there are few or\r\nno Russian settlers, and consequently the Finns have there preserved\r\nintact their language and customs; whilst in those districts which\r\npresent more inducements to colonisation, the Russian population is more\r\nnumerous, and the Finns less conservative. It must, however, be admitted\r\nthat geographical conditions do not completely explain the facts. The\r\nvarious tribes, even when placed in the same conditions, are not\r\nequally susceptible to foreign influence. The Mordva, for instance,\r\nare infinitely less conservative than the Tchuvash. This I have often\r\nnoticed, and my impression has been confirmed by men who have had more\r\nopportunities of observation. For the present we must attribute this to\r\nsome occult ethnological peculiarity, but future investigations may some\r\nday supply a more satisfactory explanation. Already I have obtained\r\nsome facts which appear to throw light on the subject. The Tchuvash have\r\ncertain customs which seem to indicate that they were formerly, if not\r\navowed Mahometans, at least under the influence of Islam, whilst we have\r\nno reason to suppose that the Mordva ever passed through that school.\r\n\r\nThe absence of religious fanaticism greatly facilitated Russian\r\ncolonisation in these northern regions, and the essentially peaceful\r\ndisposition of the Russian peasantry tended in the same direction.\r\nThe Russian peasant is admirably fitted for the work of peaceful\r\nagricultural colonisation. Among uncivilised tribes he is good-natured,\r\nlong-suffering, conciliatory, capable of bearing extreme hardships, and\r\nendowed with a marvellous power of adapting himself to circumstances.\r\nThe haughty consciousness of personal and national superiority\r\nhabitually displayed by Englishmen of all ranks when they are brought\r\nin contact with races which they look upon as lower in the scale of\r\nhumanity than themselves, is entirely foreign to his character. He has\r\nno desire to rule, and no wish to make the natives hewers of wood and\r\ndrawers of water. All he desires is a few acres of land which he and his\r\nfamily can cultivate; and so long as he is allowed to enjoy these he is\r\nnot likely to molest his neighbours. Had the colonists of the Finnish\r\ncountry been men of Anglo-Saxon race, they would in all probability have\r\ntaken possession of the land and reduced the natives to the condition of\r\nagricultural labourers. The Russian colonists have contented themselves\r\nwith a humbler and less aggressive mode of action; they have settled\r\npeaceably among the native population, and are rapidly becoming blended\r\nwith it. In many districts the so-called Russians have perhaps more\r\nFinnish than Slavonic blood in their veins.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do, it may be asked, with the aforementioned\r\nVolkerwanderung, or migration of peoples, during the Dark Ages? More\r\nthan may at first sight appear. Some of the so-called migrations were,\r\nI suspect, not at all migrations in the ordinary sense of the term, but\r\nrather gradual changes, such as those which have taken place, and are\r\nstill taking place, in Northern Russia. A thousand years ago what is now\r\nknown as the province of Yaroslavl was inhabited by Finns, and now it is\r\noccupied by men who are commonly regarded as pure Slavs. But it would be\r\nan utter mistake to suppose that the Finns of this district migrated to\r\nthose more distant regions where they are now to be found. In reality\r\nthey formerly occupied, as I have said, the whole of Northern Russia,\r\nand in the province of Yaroslavl they have been transformed by Slav\r\ninfiltration. In Central Europe the Slavs may be said in a certain\r\nsense to have retreated, for in former times they occupied the whole of\r\nNorthern Germany as far as the Elbe. But what does the word \"retreat\"\r\nmean in this case? It means probably that the Slays were gradually\r\nTeutonised, and then absorbed by the Teutonic race. Some tribes, it\r\nis true, swept over a part of Europe in genuine nomadic fashion, and\r\nendeavoured perhaps to expel or exterminate the actual possessors of the\r\nsoil. This kind of migration may likewise be studied in Russia. But I\r\nmust leave the subject till I come to speak of the southern provinces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLORD NOVGOROD THE GREAT\r\n\r\n\r\nDeparture from Ivanofka and Arrival at Novgorod--The Eastern Half of\r\nthe Town--The Kremlin--An Old Legend--The Armed Men of Rus--The\r\nNorthmen--Popular Liberty in Novgorod--The Prince and the Popular\r\nAssembly--Civil Dissensions and Faction-fights--The Commercial Republic\r\nConquered by the Muscovite Tsars--Ivan the Terrible--Present Condition\r\nof the Town--Provincial Society--Card-playing--Periodicals--\"Eternal\r\nStillness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry life in Russia is pleasant enough in summer or in winter, but\r\nbetween summer and winter there is an intermediate period of several\r\nweeks when the rain and mud transform a country-house into something\r\nvery like a prison. To escape this durance vile I determined in the\r\nmonth of October to leave Ivanofka, and chose as my headquarters for the\r\nnext few months the town of Novgorod--the old town of that name, not\r\nto be confounded with Nizhni Novgorod--i.e., Lower Novgorod, on the\r\nVolga--where the great annual fair is held.\r\n\r\nFor this choice there were several reasons. I did not wish to go to St.\r\nPetersburg or Moscow, because I foresaw that in either of those cities\r\nmy studies would certainly be interrupted. In a quiet, sleepy provincial\r\ntown I should have much more chance of coming in contact with people who\r\ncould not speak fluently any West-European languages, and much better\r\nopportunities for studying native life and local administration. Of the\r\nprovincial capitals, Novgorod was the nearest, and more interesting than\r\nmost of its rivals; for it has had a curious history, much older than\r\nthat of St. Petersburg or even of Moscow, and some traces of its\r\nformer greatness are still visible. Though now a town of third-rate\r\nimportance--a mere shadow of its former self--it still contains about\r\n21,000 inhabitants, and is the administrative centre of the large\r\nprovince in which it is situated.\r\n\r\nAbout eighty miles before reaching St. Petersburg the Moscow railway\r\ncrosses the Volkhof, a rapid, muddy river which connects Lake Ilmen with\r\nLake Ladoga. At the point of intersection I got on board a small steamer\r\nand sailed up stream towards Lake Ilmen for about fifty miles.* The\r\njourney was tedious, for the country was flat and monotonous, and the\r\nsteamer, though it puffed and snorted inordinately, did not make more\r\nthan nine knots. Towards sunset Novgorod appeared on the horizon.\r\nSeen thus at a distance in the soft twilight, it seemed decidedly\r\npicturesque. On the east bank lay the greater part of the town, the sky\r\nline of which was agreeably broken by the green roofs and pear-shaped\r\ncupolas of many churches. On the opposite bank rose the Kremlin.\r\nSpanning the river was a long, venerable stone bridge, half hidden by a\r\ntemporary wooden one, which was doing duty for the older structure while\r\nthe latter was being repaired. A cynical fellow-passenger assured me\r\nthat the temporary structure was destined to become permanent, because\r\nit yielded a comfortable revenue to certain officials, but this sinister\r\nprediction has not been verified.\r\n\r\n     * The journey would now be made by rail, but the branch line\r\n     which runs near the bank of the river had not been\r\n     constructed at that time.\r\n\r\nThat part of Novgorod which lies on the eastern bank of the river, and\r\nin which I took up my abode for several months, contains nothing that\r\nis worthy of special mention. As is the case in most Russian towns, the\r\nstreets are straight, wide, and ill-paved, and all run parallel or\r\nat right angles to each other. At the end of the bridge is a spacious\r\nmarket-place, flanked on one side by the Town-house. Near the other side\r\nstand the houses of the Governor and of the chief military authority\r\nof the district. The only other buildings of note are the numerous\r\nchurches, which are mostly small, and offer nothing that is likely to\r\ninterest the student of architecture. Altogether this part of the town\r\nis unquestionably commonplace. The learned archaeologist may detect in\r\nit some traces of the distant past, but the ordinary traveller will find\r\nlittle to arrest his attention.\r\n\r\nIf now we cross over to the other side of the river, we are at once\r\nconfronted by something which very few Russian towns possess--a kremlin,\r\nor citadel. This is a large and slightly-elevated enclosure, surrounded\r\nby high brick walls, and in part by the remains of a moat. Before the\r\ndays of heavy artillery these walls must have presented a formidable\r\nbarrier to any besieging force, but they have long ceased to have any\r\nmilitary significance, and are now nothing more than an historical\r\nmonument. Passing through the gateway which faces the bridge, we find\r\nourselves in a large open space. To the right stands the cathedral--a\r\nsmall, much-venerated church, which can make no pretensions to\r\narchitectural beauty--and an irregular group of buildings containing the\r\nconsistory and the residence of the Archbishop. To the left is a long\r\nsymmetrical range of buildings containing the Government offices and the\r\nlaw courts. Midway between this and the cathedral, in the centre of\r\nthe great open space, stands a colossal monument, composed of a massive\r\ncircular stone pedestal and an enormous globe, on and around which\r\ncluster a number of emblematic and historical figures. This curious\r\nmonument, which has at least the merit of being original in design, was\r\nerected in 1862, in commemoration of Russia\u0027s thousandth birthday,\r\nand is supposed to represent the history of Russia in general and of\r\nNovgorod in particular during the last thousand years. It was placed\r\nhere because Novgorod is the oldest of Russian towns, and because\r\nsomewhere in the surrounding country occurred the incident which\r\nis commonly recognised as the foundation of the Russian Empire. The\r\nincident in question is thus described in the oldest chronicle:\r\n\r\n\"At that time, as the southern Slavonians paid tribute to the Kozars, so\r\nthe Novgorodian Slavonians suffered from the attacks of the Variags. For\r\nsome time the Variags exacted tribute from the Novgorodian Slavonians\r\nand the neighbouring Finns; then the conquered tribes, by uniting their\r\nforces, drove out the foreigners. But among the Slavonians arose strong\r\ninternal dissensions; the clans rose against each other. Then, for the\r\ncreation of order and safety, they resolved to call in princes from a\r\nforeign land. In the year 862 Slavonic legates went away beyond the\r\nsea to the Variag tribe called Rus, and said, \u0027Our land is great and\r\nfruitful, but there is no order in it; come and reign and rule over us.\u0027\r\nThree brothers accepted the invitation, and appeared with their armed\r\nfollowers. The eldest of these, Rurik, settled in Novgorod; the second,\r\nSineus, at Byelo-ozero; and the third, Truvor, in Isborsk. From them our\r\nland is called Rus. After two years the brothers of Rurik died. He alone\r\nbegan to rule over the Novgorod district, and confided to his men the\r\nadministration of the principal towns.\"\r\n\r\nThis simple legend has given rise to a vast amount of learned\r\ncontroversy, and historical investigators have fought valiantly with\r\neach other over the important question, Who were those armed men of Rus?\r\nFor a long time the commonly received opinion was that they were Normans\r\nfrom Scandinavia. The Slavophils accepted the legend literally in this\r\nsense, and constructed upon it an ingenious theory of Russian history.\r\nThe nations of the West, they said, were conquered by invaders, who\r\nseized the country and created the feudal system for their own benefit;\r\nhence the history of Western Europe is a long tale of bloody struggles\r\nbetween conquerors and conquered, and at the present day the old enmity\r\nstill lives in the political rivalry of the different social classes.\r\nThe Russo-Slavonians, on the contrary, were not conquered, but\r\nvoluntarily invited a foreign prince to come and rule over them!\r\nHence the whole social and political development of Russia has been\r\nessentially peaceful, and the Russian people know nothing of social\r\ncastes or feudalism. Though this theory afforded some nourishment for\r\npatriotic self-satisfaction, it displeased extreme patriots, who did not\r\nlike the idea that order was first established in their country by men\r\nof Teutonic race. These preferred to adopt the theory that Rurik and his\r\ncompanions were Slavonians from the shores of the Baltic.\r\n\r\nThough I devoted to the study of this question more time and labour than\r\nperhaps the subject deserved, I have no intention of inviting the reader\r\nto follow me through the tedious controversy. Suffice it to say that,\r\nafter careful consideration, and with all due deference to recent\r\nhistorians, I am inclined to adopt the old theory, and to regard the\r\nNormans of Scandinavia as in a certain sense the founders of the Russian\r\nEmpire. We know from other sources that during the ninth century there\r\nwas a great exodus from Scandinavia. Greedy of booty, and fired with\r\nthe spirit of adventure, the Northmen, in their light, open boats, swept\r\nalong the coasts of Germany, France, Spain, Greece, and Asia Minor,\r\npillaging the towns and villages near the sea, and entering into the\r\nheart of the country by means of the rivers. At first they were mere\r\nmarauders, and showed everywhere such ferocity and cruelty that they\r\ncame to be regarded as something akin to plagues and famines, and the\r\nfaithful added a new petition to the Litany, \"From the wrath and malice\r\nof the Normans, O Lord, deliver us!\" But towards the middle of the\r\ncentury the movement changed its character. The raids became military\r\ninvasions, and the invaders sought to conquer the lands which they had\r\nformerly plundered, \"ut acquirant sibi spoliando regna quibus possent\r\nvivere pace perpetua.\" The chiefs embraced Christianity, married the\r\ndaughters or sisters of the reigning princes, and obtained the conquered\r\nterritories as feudal grants. Thus arose Norman principalities in the\r\nLow Countries, in France, in Italy, and in Sicily; and the Northmen,\r\nrapidly blending with the native population, soon showed as much\r\npolitical talent as they had formerly shown reckless and destructive\r\nvalour.\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange indeed if these adventurers, who succeeded\r\nin reaching Asia Minor and the coasts of North America, should have\r\noverlooked Russia, which lay, as it were, at their very doors. The\r\nVolkhof, flowing through Novgorod, formed part of a great waterway which\r\nafforded almost uninterrupted water-communication between the Baltic and\r\nthe Black Sea; and we know that some time afterwards the Scandinavians\r\nused this route in their journeys to Constantinople. The change which\r\nthe Scandinavian movement underwent elsewhere is clearly indicated\r\nby the Russian chronicles: first, the Variags came as collectors of\r\ntribute, and raised so much popular opposition that they were expelled,\r\nand then they came as rulers, and settled in the country. Whether they\r\nreally came on invitation may be doubted, but that they adopted the\r\nlanguage, religion, and customs of the native population does not\r\nmilitate against the assertion that they were Normans. On the contrary,\r\nwe have here rather an additional confirmation, for elsewhere the\r\nNormans did likewise. In the North of France they adopted almost at\r\nonce the French language and religion, and the son and successor of\r\nthe famous Rollo was sometimes reproached with being more French than\r\nNorman.*\r\n\r\n     *Strinnholm, \"Die Vikingerzuge\" (Hamburg, 1839), I., p. 135.\r\n\r\nThough it is difficult to decide how far the legend is literally true,\r\nthere can be no possible doubt that the event which it more or less\r\naccurately describes had an important influence on Russian history. From\r\nthat time dates the rapid expansion of the Russo-Slavonians--a movement\r\nthat is still going on at the present day. To the north, the east, and\r\nthe south new principalities were formed and governed by men who all\r\nclaimed to be descendants of Rurik, and down to the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury no Russian outside of this great family ever attempted to\r\nestablish independent sovereignty.\r\n\r\nFor six centuries after the so-called invitation of Rurik the city on\r\nthe Volkhof had a strange, checkered history. Rapidly it conquered the\r\nneighbouring Finnish tribes, and grew into a powerful independent state,\r\nwith a territory extending to the Gulf of Finland, and northwards to the\r\nWhite Sea. At the same time its commercial importance increased, and it\r\nbecame an outpost of the Hanseatic League. In this work the descendants\r\nof Rurik played an important part, but they were always kept in strict\r\nsubordination to the popular will. Political freedom kept pace with\r\ncommercial prosperity. What means Rurik employed for establishing\r\nand preserving order we know not, but the chronicles show that his\r\nsuccessors in Novgorod possessed merely such authority as was freely\r\ngranted them by the people. The supreme power resided, not in the\r\nprince, but in the assembly of the citizens called together in the\r\nmarket-place by the sound of the great bell. This assembly made laws\r\nfor the prince as well as for the people, entered into alliances with\r\nforeign powers, declared war, and concluded peace, imposed taxes,\r\nraised troops, and not only elected the magistrates, but also judged and\r\ndeposed them when it thought fit. The prince was little more than\r\nthe hired commander of the troops and the president of the judicial\r\nadministration. When entering on his functions he had to take a solemn\r\noath that he would faithfully observe the ancient laws and usages, and\r\nif he failed to fulfil his promise he was sure to be summarily deposed\r\nand expelled. The people had an old rhymed proverb, \"Koli khud knyaz,\r\ntak v gryaz!\" \"If the prince is bad, into the mud with him!\", and they\r\nhabitually acted according to it. So unpleasant, indeed, was the task of\r\nruling those sturdy, stiff-necked burghers, that some princes refused to\r\nundertake it, and others, having tried it for a time, voluntarily laid\r\ndown their authority and departed. But these frequent depositions and\r\nabdications--as many as thirty took place in the course of a single\r\ncentury--did not permanently disturb the existing order of things. The\r\ndescendants of Rurik were numerous, and there were always plenty of\r\ncandidates for the vacant post. The municipal republic continued to\r\ngrow in strength and in riches, and during the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies it proudly styled itself \"Lord Novgorod the Great\" (Gospodin\r\nVelilki Novgorod).\r\n\r\n\"Then came a change, as all things human change.\" To the east arose\r\nthe principality of Moscow--not an old, rich municipal republic, but a\r\nyoung, vigorous State, ruled by a line of crafty, energetic, ambitious,\r\nand unscrupulous princes of the Rurik stock, who were freeing the\r\ncountry from the Tartar yoke and gradually annexing by fair means and\r\nfoul the neighbouring principalities to their own dominions. At the same\r\ntime, and in a similar manner, the Lithuanian Princes to the westward\r\nunited various small principalities and formed a large independent\r\nState. Thus Novgorod found itself in a critical position. Under a\r\nstrong Government it might have held its own against these rivals and\r\nsuccessfully maintained its independence, but its strength was already\r\nundermined by internal dissensions. Political liberty had led to\r\nanarchy. Again and again on that great open space where the national\r\nmonument now stands, and in the market-place on the other side of the\r\nriver, scenes of disorder and bloodshed took place, and more than once\r\non the bridge battles were fought by contending factions. Sometimes it\r\nwas a contest between rival families, and sometimes a struggle between\r\nthe municipal aristocracy, who sought to monopolise the political\r\npower, and the common people, who wished to have a large share in the\r\nadministration. A State thus divided against itself could not long\r\nresist the aggressive tendencies of powerful neighbours. Artful\r\ndiplomacy could but postpone the evil day, and it required no great\r\npolitical foresight to predict that sooner or later Novgorod must become\r\nLithuanian or Muscovite. The great families inclined to Lithuania, but\r\nthe popular party and the clergy, disliking Roman Catholicism, looked to\r\nMoscow for assistance, and the Grand Princes of Muscovy ultimately won\r\nthe prize.\r\n\r\nThe barbarous way in which the Grand Princes effected the annexation\r\nshows how thoroughly they had imbibed the spirit of Tartar\r\nstatesmanship. Thousands of families were transported to Moscow, and\r\nMuscovite families put in their places; and when, in spite of this, the\r\nold spirit revived, Ivan the Terrible determined to apply the method of\r\nphysical extermination which he had found so effectual in breaking the\r\npower of his own nobles. Advancing with a large army, which met with no\r\nresistance, he devastated the country with fire and sword, and during a\r\nresidence of five weeks in the town he put the inhabitants to death\r\nwith a ruthless ferocity which has perhaps never been surpassed even by\r\nOriental despots. If those old walls could speak they would have many\r\na horrible tale to tell. Enough has been preserved in the chronicles to\r\ngive us some idea of this awful time. Monks and priests were subjected\r\nto the Tartar punishment called pravezh, which consisted in tying the\r\nvictim to a stake, and flogging him daily until a certain sum of money\r\nwas paid for his release. The merchants and officials were tortured with\r\nfire, and then thrown from the bridge with their wives and children\r\ninto the river. Lest any of them should escape by swimming, boatfuls\r\nof soldiers despatched those who were not killed by the fall. At the\r\npresent day there is a curious bubbling immediately below the bridge,\r\nwhich prevents the water from freezing in winter, and according to\r\npopular belief this is caused by the spirits of the terrible Tsar\u0027s\r\nvictims. Of those who were murdered in the villages there is no record,\r\nbut in the town alone no less than 60,000 human beings are said to have\r\nbeen butchered--an awful hecatomb on the altar of national unity and\r\nautocratic power!\r\n\r\nThis tragic scene, which occurred in 1570, closes the history of\r\nNovgorod as an independent State. Its real independence had long\r\nsince ceased to exist, and now the last spark of the old spirit was\r\nextinguished. The Tsars could not suffer even a shadow of political\r\nindependence to exist within their dominions.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, when many Hanseatic merchants annually visited the\r\ncity, and when the market-place, the bridge, and the Kremlin were often\r\nthe scene of violent political struggles, Novgorod must have been an\r\ninteresting place to live in; but now its glory has departed, and in\r\nrespect of social resources it is not even a first-rate provincial town.\r\nKief, Kharkof, and other towns which are situated at a greater distance\r\nfrom the capital, in districts fertile enough to induce the nobles to\r\nfarm their own land, are in their way little semi-independent centres of\r\ncivilisation. They contain a theatre, a library, two or three clubs, and\r\nlarge houses belonging to rich landed proprietors, who spend the\r\nsummer on their estates and come into town for the winter months. These\r\nproprietors, together with the resident officials, form a numerous\r\nsociety, and during the winter, dinner-parties, balls, and other social\r\ngatherings are by no means infrequent. In Novgorod the society is much\r\nmore limited. It does not, like Kief, Kharkof, and Kazan, possess a\r\nuniversity, and it contains no houses belonging to wealthy nobles. The\r\nfew proprietors of the province who live on their estates, and are rich\r\nenough to spend part of the year in town, prefer St. Petersburg for\r\ntheir winter residence. The society, therefore, is composed exclusively\r\nof the officials and of the officers who happen to be quartered in the\r\ntown or the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nOf all the people whose acquaintance I made at Novgorod, I can recall\r\nonly two men who did not occupy some official position, civil or\r\nmilitary. One of these was a retired doctor, who was attempting to farm\r\non scientific principles, and who, I believe, soon afterwards gave up\r\nthe attempt and migrated elsewhere. The other was a Polish bishop who\r\nhad been compromised in the insurrection of 1863, and was condemned to\r\nlive here under police supervision. This latter could scarcely be said\r\nto belong to the society of the place; though he sometimes appeared\r\nat the unceremonious weekly receptions given by the Governor, and was\r\ninvariably treated by all present with marked respect, he could not but\r\nfeel that he was in a false position, and he was rarely or never seen in\r\nother houses.\r\n\r\nThe official circle of a town like Novgorod is sure to contain a good\r\nmany people of average education and agreeable manners, but it is\r\nsure to be neither brilliant nor interesting. Though it is constantly\r\nundergoing a gradual renovation by the received system of frequently\r\ntransferring officials from one town to another, it preserves\r\nfaithfully, in spite of the new blood which it thus receives, its\r\nessentially languid character. When a new official arrives he exchanges\r\nvisits with all the notables, and for a few days he produces quite a\r\nsensation in the little community. If he appears at social gatherings\r\nhe is much talked to, and if he does not appear he is much talked about.\r\nHis former history is repeatedly narrated, and his various merits and\r\ndefects assiduously discussed.\r\n\r\nIf he is married, and has brought his wife with him, the field of\r\ncomment and discussion is very much enlarged. The first time that Madame\r\nappears in society she is the \"cynosure of neighbouring eyes.\" Her\r\nfeatures, her complexion, her hair, her dress, and her jewellery are\r\ncarefully noted and criticised. Perhaps she has brought with her, from\r\nthe capital or from abroad, some dresses of the newest fashion. As soon\r\nas this is discovered she at once becomes an object of special curiosity\r\nto the ladies, and of envious jealousy to those who regard as a personal\r\ngrievance the presence of a toilette finer or more fashionable than\r\ntheir own. Her demeanour, too, is very carefully observed. If she is\r\nfriendly and affable in manner, she is patronised; if she is distant and\r\nreserved, she is condemned as proud and pretentious. In either case\r\nshe is pretty sure to form a close intimacy with some one of the older\r\nfemale residents, and for a few weeks the two ladies are inseparable,\r\ntill some incautious word or act disturbs the new-born friendship, and\r\nthe devoted friends become bitter enemies. Voluntarily or involuntarily\r\nthe husbands get mixed up in the quarrel. Highly undesirable qualities\r\nare discovered in the characters of all parties concerned, and are made\r\nthe subject of unfriendly comment. Then the feud subsides, and some new\r\nfeud of a similar kind comes to occupy the public attention. Mrs. A.\r\nwonders how her friends Mr. and Mrs. B. can afford to lose considerable\r\nsums every evening at cards, and suspects that they are getting into\r\ndebt or starving themselves and their children; in her humble opinion\r\nthey would do well to give fewer supper-parties, and to refrain from\r\npoisoning their guests. The bosom friend to whom this is related retails\r\nit directly or indirectly to Mrs. B., and Mrs. B. naturally retaliates.\r\nHere is a new quarrel, which for some time affords material for\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no quarrel, there is sure to be a bit of scandal afloat.\r\nThough Russian provincial society is not at all prudish, and leans\r\nrather to the side of extreme leniency, it cannot entirely overlook les\r\nconvenances. Madame C. has always a large number of male admirers, and\r\nto this there can be no reasonable objection so long as her husband does\r\nnot complain, but she really parades her preference for Mr. X. at balls\r\nand parties a little too conspicuously. Then there is Madame D., with\r\nthe big dreamy eyes. How can she remain in the place after her husband\r\nwas killed in a duel by a brother officer? Ostensibly the cause of the\r\nquarrel was a trifling incident at the card-table, but every one knows\r\nthat in reality she was the cause of the deadly encounter. And so on,\r\nand so on. In the absence of graver interests society naturally\r\nbestows inordinate attention on the private affairs of its members; and\r\nquarrelling, backbiting, and scandal-mongery help indolent people to\r\nkill the time that hangs heavily on their hands.\r\n\r\nPotent as these instruments are, they are not sufficient to kill all the\r\nleisure hours. In the forenoons the gentlemen are occupied with their\r\nofficial duties, whilst the ladies go out shopping or pay visits,\r\nand devote any time that remains to their household duties and their\r\nchildren; but the day\u0027s work is over about four o\u0027clock, and the long\r\nevening remains to be filled up. The siesta may dispose of an hour or an\r\nhour and a half, but about seven o\u0027clock some definite occupation has to\r\nbe found. As it is impossible to devote the whole evening to discussing\r\nthe ordinary news of the day, recourse is almost invariably had\r\nto card-playing, which is indulged in to an extent that we had no\r\nconception of in England until Bridge was imported. Hour after hour\r\nthe Russians of both sexes will sit in a hot room, filled with a\r\nconstantly-renewed cloud of tobacco-smoke--in the production of\r\nwhich most of the ladies take part--and silently play \"Preference,\"\r\n\"Yarolash,\" or Bridge. Those who for some reason are obliged to be alone\r\ncan amuse themselves with \"Patience,\" in which no partner is required.\r\nIn the other games the stakes are commonly very small, but the sittings\r\nare often continued so long that a player may win or lose two or three\r\npounds sterling. It is no unusual thing for gentlemen to play for eight\r\nor nine hours at a time. At the weekly club dinners, before coffee had\r\nbeen served, nearly all present used to rush off impatiently to the\r\ncard-room, and sit there placidly from five o\u0027clock in the afternoon\r\ntill one or two o\u0027clock in the morning! When I asked my friends why they\r\ndevoted so much time to this unprofitable occupation, they always gave\r\nme pretty much the same answer: \"What are we to do? We have been reading\r\nor writing official papers all day, and in the evening we like to have\r\na little relaxation. When we come together we have very little to talk\r\nabout, for we have all read the daily papers and nothing more. The best\r\nthing we can do is to sit down at the card-table, where we can spend our\r\ntime pleasantly, without the necessity of talking.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the daily papers, some people read the monthly\r\nperiodicals--big, thick volumes, containing several serious articles on\r\nhistorical and social subjects, sections of one or two novels, satirical\r\nsketches, and a long review of home and foreign politics on the model\r\nof those in the Revue des Deux Mondes. Several of these periodicals\r\nare very ably conducted, and offer to their readers a large amount of\r\nvaluable information; but I have noticed that the leaves of the more\r\nserious part often remain uncut. The translation of a sensation novel by\r\nthe latest French or English favourite finds many more readers than an\r\narticle by an historian or a political economist. As to books, they seem\r\nto be very little read, for during all the time I lived in Novgorod I\r\nnever discovered a bookseller\u0027s shop, and when I required books I had to\r\nget them sent from St. Petersburg. The local administration, it is true,\r\nconceived the idea of forming a museum and circulating library, but in\r\nmy time the project was never realised. Of all the magnificent projects\r\nthat are formed in Russia, only a very small percentage come into\r\nexistence, and these are too often very short-lived. The Russians\r\nhave learned theoretically what are the wants of the most advanced\r\ncivilisation, and are ever ready to rush into the grand schemes which\r\ntheir theoretical knowledge suggests; but very few of them really\r\nand permanently feel these wants, and consequently the institutions\r\nartificially formed to satisfy them very soon languish and die. In the\r\nprovincial towns the shops for the sale of gastronomic delicacies spring\r\nup and flourish, whilst shops for the sale of intellectual food are\r\nrarely to be met with.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of December the ordinary monotony of Novgorod life\r\nis a little relieved by the annual Provincial Assembly, which sits\r\ndaily for two or three weeks and discusses the economic wants of\r\nthe province.* During this time a good many landed proprietors, who\r\nhabitually live on their estates or in St. Petersburg, collect in\r\nthe town, and enliven a little the ordinary society. But as Christmas\r\napproaches the deputies disperse, and again the town becomes enshrouded\r\nin that \"eternal stillness\" (vetchnaya tishina) which a native poet has\r\ndeclared to be the essential characteristic of Russian provincial life.\r\n\r\n     * Of these Assemblies I shall have more to say when I come\r\n     to describe the local self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNS AND THE MERCANTILE CLASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Character of Russian Towns--Scarcity of Towns in Russia--Why\r\nthe Urban Element in the Population is so Small--History of\r\nRussian Municipal Institutions--Unsuccessful Efforts to Create a\r\nTiers-etat--Merchants, Burghers, and Artisans--Town Council--A Rich\r\nMerchant--His House--His Love of Ostentation--His Conception of\r\nAristocracy--Official Decorations--Ignorance and Dishonesty of the\r\nCommercial Classes--Symptoms of Change.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who wish to enjoy the illusions produced by scene painting and\r\nstage decorations should never go behind the scenes. In like manner he\r\nwho wishes to preserve the delusion that Russian provincial towns are\r\npicturesque should never enter them, but content himself with viewing\r\nthem from a distance.\r\n\r\nHowever imposing they may look when seen from the outside, they will be\r\nfound on closer inspection, with very few exceptions, to be little more\r\nthan villages in disguise. If they have not a positively rustic, they\r\nhave at least a suburban, appearance. The streets are straight and wide,\r\nand are either miserably paved or not paved at all. Trottoirs are\r\nnot considered indispensable. The houses are built of wood or brick,\r\ngenerally one-storied, and separated from each other by spacious yards.\r\nMany of them do not condescend to turn their facades to the street. The\r\ngeneral impression produced is that the majority of the burghers have\r\ncome from the country, and have brought their country-houses with them.\r\nThere are few or no shops with merchandise tastefully arranged in the\r\nwindow to tempt the passer-by. If you wish to make purchases you must\r\ngo to the Gostinny Dvor,* or Bazaar, which consists of long, symmetrical\r\nrows of low-roofed, dimly-lighted stores, with a colonnade in front.\r\nThis is the place where merchants most do congregate, but it presents\r\nnothing of that bustle and activity which we are accustomed to associate\r\nwith commercial life. The shopkeepers stand at their doors or loiter\r\nabout in the immediate vicinity waiting for customers. From the scarcity\r\nof these latter I should say that when sales are effected the profits\r\nmust be enormous.\r\n\r\n     * These words mean literally the Guests\u0027 Court or Yard.  The\r\n     Ghosti--a word which is etymologically the same as our\r\n     \"host\" and \"guest\"--were originally the merchants who traded\r\n     with other towns or other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the other parts of the town the air of solitude and languor is\r\nstill more conspicuous. In the great square, or by the side of the\r\npromenade--if the town is fortunate enough to have one--cows or horses\r\nmay be seen grazing tranquilly, without being at all conscious of the\r\nincongruity of their position. And, indeed, it would be strange if they\r\nhad any such consciousness, for it does not exist in the minds either\r\nof the police or of the inhabitants. At night the streets may be lighted\r\nmerely with a few oil-lamps, which do little more than render the\r\ndarkness visible, so that cautious citizens returning home late often\r\nprovide themselves with lanterns. As late as the sixties the learned\r\nhistorian, Pogodin, then a town-councillor of Moscow, opposed the\r\nlighting of the city with gas on the ground that those who chose to\r\ngo out at night should carry their lamps with them. The objection was\r\noverruled, and Moscow is now fairly well lit, but the provincial towns\r\nare still far from being on the same level. Some retain their old\r\nprimitive arrangements, while others enjoy the luxury of electric\r\nlighting.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of large towns in Russia is not less remarkable than their\r\nrustic appearance. According to the last census (1897) the number of\r\ntowns, officially so-called, is 1,321, but about three-fifths of them\r\nhave under 5,000 inhabitants; only 104 have over 25,000, and only 19\r\nover 100,000. These figures indicate plainly that the urban element of\r\nthe population is relatively small, and it is declared by the official\r\nstatisticians to be only 14 per cent., as against 72 per cent. in Great\r\nBritain, but it is now increasing rapidly. When the first edition of\r\nthis work was published, in 1877, European Russia in the narrower sense\r\nof the term--excluding Finland, the Baltic Provinces, Lithuania, Poland,\r\nand the Caucasus--had only 11 towns with a population of over 50,000,\r\nand now there are 34; that is to say, the number of such towns has more\r\nthan trebled. In the other portions of the country a similar increase\r\nhas taken place. The towns which have become important industrial and\r\ncommercial centres have naturally grown most rapidly. For example, in\r\na period of twelve years (1885-97) the populations of Lodz, of\r\nEkaterinoslaf, of Baku, of Yaroslavl, and of Libau, have more than\r\ndoubled. In the five largest towns of the Empire--St. Petersburg,\r\nMoscow, Warsaw, Odessa and Lodz--the aggregate population rose during\r\nthe same twelve years from 2,423,000 to 3,590,000, or nearly 50 per\r\ncent. In ten other towns, with populations varying from 50,000 to\r\n282,000, the aggregate rose from 780,000 to 1,382,000, or about 77 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThat Russia should have taken so long to assimilate herself in this\r\nrespect to Western Europe is to be explained by the geographical and\r\npolitical conditions. Her population was not hemmed in by natural\r\nor artificial frontiers strong enough to restrain their expansive\r\ntendencies. To the north, the east, and the southeast there was a\r\nboundless expanse of fertile, uncultivated land, offering a tempting\r\nfield for emigration; and the peasantry have ever shown themselves ready\r\nto take advantage of their opportunities. Instead of improving their\r\nprimitive system of agriculture, which requires an enormous area and\r\nrapidly exhausts the soil, they have always found it easier and more\r\nprofitable to emigrate and take possession of the virgin land beyond.\r\nThus the territory--sometimes with the aid of, and sometimes in spite\r\nof, the Government--has constantly expanded, and has already reached the\r\nPolar Ocean, the Pacific, and the northern offshoots of the Himalayas.\r\nThe little district around the sources of the Dnieper has grown into a\r\nmighty empire, comprising one-seventh of the land surface of the globe.\r\nProlific as the Russian race is, its power of reproduction could not\r\nkeep pace with its territorial expansion, and consequently the country\r\nis still very thinly peopled. According to the latest census (1897) in\r\nthe whole empire there are under 130 millions of inhabitants, and the\r\naverage density of population is only about fifteen to the English\r\nsquare mile. Even the most densely populated provinces, including Moscow\r\nwith its 988,610 inhabitants, cannot show more than 189 to the English\r\nsquare mile, whereas England has about 400. A people that has such\r\nan abundance of land, and can support itself by agriculture, is not\r\nnaturally disposed to devote itself to industry, or to congregate in\r\nlarge cities.\r\n\r\nFor many generations there were other powerful influences working in the\r\nsame direction. Of these the most important was serfage, which was not\r\nabolished till 1861. That institution, and the administrative system of\r\nwhich it formed an essential part, tended to prevent the growth of the\r\ntowns by hemming the natural movements of the population. Peasants, for\r\nexample, who learned trades, and who ought to have drifted naturally\r\ninto the burgher class, were mostly retained by the master on his\r\nestate, where artisans of all sorts were daily wanted, and the few who\r\nwere sent to seek work in the towns were not allowed to settle there\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\nThus the insignificance of the Russian towns is to be attributed mainly\r\nto two causes. The abundance of land tended to prevent the development\r\nof industry, and the little industry which did exist was prevented by\r\nserfage from collecting in the towns. But this explanation is evidently\r\nincomplete. The same causes existed during the Middle Ages in Central\r\nEurope, and yet, in spite of them, flourishing cities grew up and played\r\nan important part in the social and political history of Germany. In\r\nthese cities collected traders and artisans, forming a distinct\r\nsocial class, distinguished from the nobles on the one hand, and the\r\nsurrounding peasantry on the other, by peculiar occupations, peculiar\r\naims, peculiar intellectual physiognomy, and peculiar moral conceptions.\r\nWhy did these important towns and this burgher class not likewise come\r\ninto existence in Russia, in spite of the two preventive causes above\r\nmentioned?\r\n\r\nTo discuss this question fully it would be necessary to enter into\r\ncertain debated points of mediaeval history. All I can do here is to\r\nindicate what seems to me the true explanation.\r\n\r\nIn Central Europe, all through the Middle Ages, a perpetual struggle\r\nwent on between the various political factors of which society was\r\ncomposed, and the important towns were in a certain sense the products\r\nof this struggle. They were preserved and fostered by the mutual rivalry\r\nof the Sovereign, the Feudal Nobility, and the Church; and those who\r\ndesired to live by trade or industry settled in them in order to enjoy\r\nthe protection and immunities which they afforded. In Russia there was\r\nnever any political struggle of this kind. As soon as the Grand Princes\r\nof Moscow, in the sixteenth century, threw off the yoke of the Tartars,\r\nand made themselves Tsars of all Russia, their power was irresistible\r\nand uncontested. Complete masters of the situation, they organised the\r\ncountry as they thought fit. At first their policy was favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of the towns. Perceiving that the mercantile and industrial\r\nclasses might be made a rich source of revenue, they separated them from\r\nthe peasantry, gave them the exclusive right of trading, prevented\r\nthe other classes from competing with them, and freed them from the\r\nauthority of the landed proprietors. Had they carried out this policy in\r\na cautious, rational way, they might have created a rich burgher class;\r\nbut they acted with true Oriental short-sightedness, and defeated their\r\nown purpose by imposing inordinately heavy taxes, and treating the urban\r\npopulation as their serfs. The richer merchants were forced to serve\r\nas custom-house officers--often at a great distance from their\r\ndomiciles*--and artisans were yearly summoned to Moscow to do work for\r\nthe Tsars without remuneration.\r\n\r\n     * Merchants from Yaroslavl, for instance, were sent to\r\n     Astrakhan to collect the custom-dues.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the system of taxation was radically defective, and\r\nthe members of the local administration, who received no pay and were\r\npractically free from control, were merciless in their exactions. In a\r\nword, the Tsars used their power so stupidly and so recklessly that the\r\nindustrial and trading population, instead of fleeing to the towns to\r\nsecure protection, fled from them to escape oppression. At length this\r\nemigration from the towns assumed such dimensions that it was found\r\nnecessary to prevent it by administrative and legislative measures;\r\nand the urban population was legally fixed in the towns as the rural\r\npopulation was fixed to the soil. Those who fled were brought back as\r\nrunaways, and those who attempted flight a second time were ordered to\r\nbe flogged and transported to Siberia.*\r\n\r\n     * See the \"Ulozhenie\" (i.e. the laws of Alexis, father of\r\n     Peter the Great), chap. xix. 13.\r\n\r\nWith the eighteenth century began a new era in the history of the\r\ntowns and of the urban population. Peter the Great observed, during his\r\ntravels in Western Europe, that national wealth and prosperity reposed\r\nchiefly on the enterprising, educated middle classes, and he attributed\r\nthe poverty of his own country to the absence of this burgher element.\r\nMight not such a class be created in Russia? Peter unhesitatingly\r\nassumed that it might, and set himself at once to create it in a simple,\r\nstraightforward way. Foreign artisans were imported into his dominions\r\nand foreign merchants were invited to trade with his subjects; young\r\nRussians were sent abroad to learn the useful arts; efforts were made to\r\ndisseminate practical knowledge by the translation of foreign books\r\nand the foundation of schools; all kinds of trade were encouraged, and\r\nvarious industrial enterprises were organised. At the same time the\r\nadministration of the towns was thoroughly reorganised after the model\r\nof the ancient free-towns of Germany. In place of the old organisation,\r\nwhich was a slightly modified form of the rural Commune, they received\r\nGerman municipal institutions, with burgomasters, town councils, courts\r\nof justice, guilds for the merchants, trade corporations (tsekhi)\r\nfor the artisans, and an endless list of instructions regarding the\r\ndevelopment of trade and industry, the building of hospitals, sanitary\r\nprecautions, the founding of schools, the dispensation of justice, the\r\norganisation of the police, and similar matters.\r\n\r\nCatherine II. followed in the same track. If she did less for trade\r\nand industry, she did more in the way of legislating and writing\r\ngrandiloquent manifestoes. In the course of her historical studies she\r\nhad learned, as she proclaims in one of her manifestoes, that \"from\r\nremotest antiquity we everywhere find the memory of town-builders\r\nelevated to the same level as the memory of legislators, and we see\r\nthat heroes, famous for their victories, hoped by town-building to give\r\nimmortality to their names.\" As the securing of immortality for her own\r\nname was her chief aim in life, she acted in accordance with historical\r\nprecedent, and created 216 towns in the short space of twenty-three\r\nyears. This seems a great work, but it did not satisfy her ambition.\r\nShe was not only a student of history, but was at the same time a\r\nwarm admirer of the fashionable political philosophy of her time.\r\nThat philosophy paid much attention to the tiers-etat, which was then\r\nacquiring in France great political importance, and Catherine thought\r\nthat as she had created a Noblesse on the French model, she might\r\nalso create a bourgeoisie. For this purpose she modified the municipal\r\norganisation created by her great predecessor, and granted to all the\r\ntowns an Imperial Charter. This charter remained without essential\r\nmodification until the publication of the new Municipality Law in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the Government to create a rich, intelligent tiers-etat\r\nwere not attended with much success. Their influence was always more\r\napparent in official documents than in real life. The great mass of the\r\npopulation remained serfs, fixed to the soil, whilst the nobles--that\r\nis to say, all who possessed a little education--were required for the\r\nmilitary and civil services. Those who were sent abroad to learn the\r\nuseful arts learned little, and made little use of the knowledge which\r\nthey acquired. On their return to their native country they very soon\r\nfell victims to the soporific influence of the surrounding social\r\natmosphere. The \"town-building\" had as little practical result. It was\r\nan easy matter to create any number of towns in the official sense of\r\nthe term. To transform a village into a town, it was necessary merely to\r\nprepare an izba, or log-house, for the district court, another for the\r\npolice-office, a third for the prison, and so on. On an appointed day\r\nthe Governor of the province arrived in the village, collected the\r\nofficials appointed to serve in the newly-constructed or newly-arranged\r\nlog-houses, ordered a simple religious ceremony to be performed by the\r\npriest, caused a formal act to be drawn up, and then declared the town\r\nto be \"opened.\" All this required very little creative effort; to create\r\na spirit of commercial and industrial enterprise among the population\r\nwas a more difficult matter and could not be effected by Imperial ukaz.\r\n\r\nTo animate the newly-imported municipal institutions, which had no\r\nroot in the traditions and habits of the people, was a task of equal\r\ndifficulty. In the West these institutions had been slowly devised in\r\nthe course of centuries to meet real, keenly-felt, practical wants. In\r\nRussia they were adopted for the purpose of creating those wants which\r\nwere not yet felt. Let the reader imagine our Board of Trade supplying\r\nthe masters of fishing-smacks with accurate charts, learned treatises\r\non navigation, and detailed instructions for the proper ventilation of\r\nships\u0027 cabins, and he will have some idea of the effect which Peter\u0027s\r\nlegislation had upon the towns. The office-bearers, elected against\r\ntheir will, were hopelessly bewildered by the complicated procedure, and\r\nwere incapable of understanding the numerous ukazes which prescribed\r\nto them their multifarious duties and threatened the most merciless\r\npunishments for sins of omission and commission. Soon, however, it was\r\ndiscovered that the threats were not nearly so dreadful as they seemed;\r\nand accordingly those municipal authorities who were to protect and\r\nenlighten the burghers, \"forgot the fear of God and the Tsar,\" and\r\nextorted so unblushingly that it was found necessary to place them under\r\nthe control of Government officials.\r\n\r\nThe chief practical result of the efforts made by Peter and Catherine\r\nto create a bourgeoisie was that the inhabitants of the towns were more\r\nsystematically arranged in categories for the purpose of taxation, and\r\nthat the taxes were increased. All those parts of the new administration\r\nwhich had no direct relation to the fiscal interests of the Government\r\nhad very little vitality in them. The whole system had been arbitrarily\r\nimposed on the people, and had as motive only the Imperial will. Had\r\nthat motive power been withdrawn and the burghers left to regulate their\r\nown municipal affairs, the system would immediately have collapsed.\r\nRathhaus, burgomasters, guilds, aldermen, and all the other lifeless\r\nshadows which had been called into existence by Imperial ukaz would\r\ninstantly have vanished into space. In this fact we have one of the\r\ncharacteristic traits of Russian historical development compared with\r\nthat of Western Europe. In the West monarchy had to struggle with\r\nmunicipal institutions to prevent them from becoming too powerful; in\r\nRussia, it had to struggle with them to prevent them from committing\r\nsuicide or dying of inanition.\r\n\r\nAccording to Catherine\u0027s legislation, which remained in force until\r\n1870, and still exists in some of its main features, the towns were\r\ndivided into three categories: (1) Government towns (gubernskiye\r\ngoroda)--that is to say, the chief towns of provinces, or governments\r\n(gubernii)--in which are concentrated the various organs of provincial\r\nadministration; (2) district towns (uyezdniye goroda), in which resides\r\nthe administration of the districts (uyezdi) into which the provinces\r\nare divided; and (3) supernumerary towns (zashtatniye goroda), which\r\nhave no particular significance in the territorial administration.\r\n\r\nIn all these the municipal organisation is the same. Leaving out of\r\nconsideration those persons who happen to reside in the towns, but\r\nin reality belong to the Noblesse, the clergy, or the lower ranks of\r\nofficials, we may say that the town population is composed of three\r\ngroups: the merchants (kuptsi), the burghers in the narrower sense of\r\nthe term (meshtchanye), and the artisans (tsekhoviye). These categories\r\nare not hereditary castes, like the nobles, the clergy, and the\r\npeasantry. A noble may become a merchant, or a man may be one year a\r\nburgher, the next year an artisan, and the third year a merchant, if he\r\nchanges his occupation and pays the necessary dues. But the categories\r\nform, for the time being, distinct corporations, each possessing a\r\npeculiar organisation and peculiar privileges and obligations.\r\n\r\nOf these three groups the first in the scale of dignity is that of the\r\nmerchants. It is chiefly recruited from the burghers and the peasantry.\r\nAny one who wishes to engage in commerce inscribes himself in one of the\r\nthree guilds, according to the amount of his capital and the nature of\r\nthe operations in which he wishes to embark, and as soon as he has paid\r\nthe required dues he becomes officially a merchant. As soon as he ceases\r\nto pay these dues he ceases to be a merchant in the legal sense of the\r\nterm, and returns to the class to which he formerly belonged. There\r\nare some families whose members have belonged to the merchant class for\r\nseveral generations, and the law speaks about a certain \"velvet-book\"\r\n(barkhatnaya kniga) in which their names should be inscribed, but in\r\nreality they do not form a distinct category, and they descend at once\r\nfrom their privileged position as soon as they cease to pay the annual\r\nguild dues.\r\n\r\nThe artisans form the connecting link between the town population\r\nand the peasantry, for peasants often enrol themselves in the\r\ntrades-corporations, or tsekhi, without severing their connection\r\nwith the rural Communes to which they belong. Each trade or handicraft\r\nconstitutes a tsekh, at the head of which stands an elder and two\r\nassistants, elected by the members; and all the tsekhi together form\r\na corporation under an elected head (remeslenny golova) assisted by a\r\ncouncil composed of the elders of the various tsekhi. It is the duty of\r\nthis council and its president to regulate all matters connected with\r\nthe tsekhi, and to see that the multifarious regulations regarding\r\nmasters, journeymen, and apprentices are duly observed.\r\n\r\nThe nondescript class, composed of those who are inscribed as permanent\r\ninhabitants of the towns, but who do not belong to any guild or tsekh,\r\nconstitutes what is called the burghers in the narrower sense of the\r\nterm. Like the other two categories, they form a separate corporation,\r\nwith an elder and an administrative bureau.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the relative numerical strength of these three categories\r\nmay be obtained from the following figures. Thirty years ago in European\r\nRussia the merchant class (including wives and children) numbered about\r\n466,000, the burghers about 4,033,000, and the artisans about 260,000.\r\nThe numbers according to the last census are not yet available.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the entire municipal administration was reorganised on modern\r\nWest-European principles, and the Town Council (gorodskaya duma),\r\nwhich formed under the previous system the connecting link between the\r\nold-fashioned corporations, and was composed exclusively of members\r\nof these bodies, became a genuine representative body composed of\r\nhouseholders, irrespective of the social class to which they might\r\nbelong. A noble, provided he was a house-proprietor, could become Town\r\nCouncillor or Mayor, and in this way a certain amount of vitality and a\r\nprogressive spirit were infused into the municipal administration. As a\r\nconsequence of this change the schools, hospitals, and other benevolent\r\ninstitutions were much improved, the streets were kept cleaner and\r\nsomewhat better paved, and for a time it seemed as if the towns in\r\nRussia might gradually rise to the level of those of Western Europe. But\r\nthe charm of novelty, which so often works wonders in Russia, soon wore\r\noff. After a few years of strenuous effort the best citizens no longer\r\ncame forward as candidates, and the office-bearers selected no longer\r\ndisplayed zeal and intelligence in the discharge of their duties. In\r\nthese circumstances the Government felt called upon again to intervene.\r\nBy a decree dated June 11, 1892, it introduced a new series of reforms,\r\nby which the municipal self-government was placed more under the\r\ndirection and control of the centralised bureaucracy, and the attendance\r\nof the Town Councillors at the periodical meetings was declared to be\r\nobligatory, recalcitrant members being threatened with reprimands and\r\nfines.\r\n\r\nThis last fact speaks volumes for the low vitality of the institutions\r\nand the prevalent popular apathy with regard to municipal affairs. Nor\r\nwas the unsatisfactory state of things much improved by the new reforms;\r\non the contrary, the increased interference of the regular officials\r\ntended rather to weaken the vitality of the urban self government, and\r\nthe so-called reform was pretty generally condemned as a needlessly\r\nreactionary measure. We have here, in fact, a case of what has often\r\noccurred in the administrative history of the Russian Empire since the\r\ntime of Peter the Great, and to which I shall again have occasion to\r\nrefer. The central authority, finding itself incompetent to do all that\r\nis required of it, and wishing to make a display of liberalism, accords\r\nlarge concessions in the direction of local autonomy; and when it\r\ndiscovers that the new institutions do not accomplish all that was\r\nexpected of them, and are not quite so subservient and obsequious as\r\nis considered desirable, it returns in a certain measure to the old\r\nprinciples of centralised bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThe great development of trade and industry in recent years has of\r\ncourse enriched the mercantile classes, and has introduced into them\r\na more highly educated element, drawn chiefly from the Noblesse, which\r\nformerly eschewed such occupations; but it has not yet affected very\r\ndeeply the mode of life of those who have sprung from the old merchant\r\nfamilies and the peasantry. When a merchant, contractor, or manufacturer\r\nof the old type becomes wealthy, he builds for himself a fine house, or\r\nbuys and thoroughly repairs the house of some ruined noble, and spends\r\nmoney freely on parquetry floors, large mirrors, malachite tables, grand\r\npianos by the best makers, and other articles of furniture made of the\r\nmost costly materials. Occasionally--especially on the occasion of a\r\nmarriage or a death in the family--he will give magnificent banquets,\r\nand expend enormous sums on gigantic sterlets, choice sturgeons, foreign\r\nfruits, champagne, and all manner of costly delicacies. But this lavish,\r\nostentatious expenditure does not affect the ordinary current of his\r\ndaily life. As you enter those gaudily furnished rooms you can perceive\r\nat a glance that they are not for ordinary use. You notice a rigid\r\nsymmetry and an indescribable bareness which inevitably suggest that\r\nthe original arrangements of the upholsterer have never been modified or\r\nsupplemented. The truth is that by far the greater part of the house is\r\nused only on state occasions. The host and his family live down-stairs\r\nin small, dirty rooms, furnished in a very different, and for them more\r\ncomfortable, style. At ordinary times the fine rooms are closed, and the\r\nfine furniture carefully covered.\r\n\r\nIf you make a visite de politesse after an entertainment, you will\r\nprobably have some difficulty in gaining admission by the front door.\r\nWhen you have knocked or rung several times, some one will come round\r\nfrom the back regions and ask you what you want. Then follows another\r\nlong pause, and at last footsteps are heard approaching from within. The\r\nbolts are drawn, the door is opened, and you are led up to a spacious\r\ndrawing-room. At the wall opposite the windows there is sure to be a\r\nsofa, and before it an oval table. At each end of the table, and at\r\nright angles to the sofa, there will be a row of three arm-chairs. The\r\nother chairs will be symmetrically arranged round the room. In a few\r\nminutes the host will appear, in his long double-breasted black coat\r\nand well-polished long boots. His hair is parted in the middle, and his\r\nbeard shows no trace of scissors or razor.\r\n\r\nAfter the customary greetings have been exchanged, glasses of tea, with\r\nslices of lemon and preserves, or perhaps a bottle of champagne, are\r\nbrought in by way of refreshments. The female members of the family\r\nyou must not expect to see, unless you are an intimate friend; for the\r\nmerchants still retain something of that female seclusion which was in\r\nvogue among the upper classes before the time of Peter the Great. The\r\nhost himself will probably be an intelligent, but totally uneducated and\r\ndecidedly taciturn, man.\r\n\r\nAbout the weather and the crops he may talk fluently enough, but he will\r\nnot show much inclination to go beyond these topics. You may, perhaps,\r\ndesire to converse with him on the subject with which he is best\r\nacquainted--the trade in which he is himself engaged; but if you make\r\nthe attempt, you will certainly not gain much information, and you may\r\npossibly meet with such an incident as once happened to my travelling\r\ncompanion, a Russian gentleman who had been commissioned by two learned\r\nsocieties to collect information regarding the grain trade. When\r\nhe called on a merchant who had promised to assist him in his\r\ninvestigation, he was hospitably received; but when he began to speak\r\nabout the grain trade of the district the merchant suddenly interrupted\r\nhim, and proposed to tell him a story. The story was as follows:\r\n\r\nOnce on a time a rich landed proprietor had a son, who was a thoroughly\r\nspoilt child; and one day the boy said to his father that he wished all\r\nthe young serfs to come and sing before the door of the house. After\r\nsome attempts at dissuasion the request was granted, and the young\r\npeople assembled; but as soon as they began to sing, the boy rushed out\r\nand drove them away.\r\n\r\nWhen the merchant had told this apparently pointless story at great\r\nlength, and with much circumstantial detail, he paused a little, poured\r\nsome tea into his saucer, drank it off, and then inquired, \"Now what do\r\nyou think was the reason of this strange conduct?\"\r\n\r\nMy friend replied that the riddle surpassed his powers of divination.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the merchant, looking hard at him, with a knowing grin,\r\n\"there was no reason; and all the boy could say was, \u0027Go away, go away!\r\nI\u0027ve changed my mind; I\u0027ve changed my mind\u0027\" (poshli von; otkhotyel).\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of mistaking the point of the story. My friend\r\ntook the hint and departed.\r\n\r\nThe Russian merchant\u0027s love of ostentation is of a peculiar\r\nkind--something entirely different from English snobbery. He may delight\r\nin gaudy reception-rooms, magnificent dinners, fast trotters, costly\r\nfurs; or he may display his riches by princely donations to churches,\r\nmonasteries, or benevolent institutions: but in all this he never\r\naffects to be other than he really is. He habitually wears a costume\r\nwhich designates plainly his social position; he makes no attempt\r\nto adopt fine manners or elegant tastes; and he never seeks to gain\r\nadmission to what is called in Russia la societe. Having no desire to\r\nseem what he is not, he has a plain, unaffected manner, and sometimes\r\na quiet dignity which contrasts favourably with the affected manner of\r\nthose nobles of the lower ranks who make pretensions to being highly\r\neducated and strive to adopt the outward forms of French culture. At his\r\ngreat dinners, it is true, the merchant likes to see among his guests as\r\nmany \"generals\"--that is to say, official personages--as possible, and\r\nespecially those who happen to have a grand cordon; but he never dreams\r\nof thereby establishing an intimacy with these personages, or of being\r\ninvited by them in return. It is perfectly understood by both parties\r\nthat nothing of the kind is meant. The invitation is given and accepted\r\nfrom quite different motives. The merchant has the satisfaction of\r\nseeing at his table men of high official rank, and feels that the\r\nconsideration which he enjoys among people of his own class is thereby\r\naugmented. If he succeeds in obtaining the presence of three generals,\r\nhe obtains a victory over a rival who cannot obtain more than two. The\r\ngeneral, on his side, gets a first-rate dinner, a la russe, and acquires\r\nan undefined right to request subscriptions for public objects or\r\nbenevolent institutions.\r\n\r\nOf course this undefined right is commonly nothing more than a mere\r\ntacit understanding, but in certain cases the subject is expressly\r\nmentioned. I know of one case in which a regular bargain was made. A\r\nMoscow magnate was invited by a merchant to a dinner, and consented\r\nto go in full uniform, with all his decorations, on condition that the\r\nmerchant should subscribe a certain sum to a benevolent institution in\r\nwhich he was particularly interested. It is whispered that such bargains\r\nare sometimes made, not on behalf of benevolent institutions, but simply\r\nin the interest of the gentleman who accepts the invitation. I cannot\r\nbelieve that there are many official personages who would consent to let\r\nthemselves out as table decorations, but that it may happen is proved by\r\nthe following incident, which accidentally came to my knowledge. A\r\nrich merchant of the town of T---- once requested the Governor of the\r\nProvince to honour a family festivity with his presence, and added that\r\nhe would consider it a special favour if the \"Governoress\" would\r\nenter an appearance. To this latter request his Excellency made\r\nmany objections, and at last let the petitioner understand that her\r\nExcellency could not possibly be present, because she had no velvet\r\ndress that could bear comparison with those of several merchants\u0027 wives\r\nin the town. Two days after the interview a piece of the finest velvet\r\nthat could be procured in Moscow was received by the Governor from\r\nan unknown donor, and his wife was thus enabled to be present at the\r\nfestivity, to the complete satisfaction of all parties concerned.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the merchants recognise no aristocracy but\r\nthat of official rank. Many merchants would willingly give twenty pounds\r\nfor the presence of an \"actual State Councillor\" who perhaps never heard\r\nof his grandfather, but who can show a grand cordon; whilst they would\r\nnot give twenty pence for the presence of an undecorated Prince without\r\nofficial rank, though he might be able to trace his pedigree up to the\r\nhalf-mythical Rurik. Of the latter they would probably say, \"Kto ikh\r\nznact?\" (Who knows what sort of a fellow he is?) The former, on the\r\ncontrary, whoever his father and grandfather may have been, possesses\r\nunmistakable marks of the Tsar\u0027s favour, which, in the merchant\u0027s\r\nopinion, is infinitely more important than any rights or pretensions\r\nfounded on hereditary titles or long pedigrees.\r\n\r\nSome marks of Imperial favour the old-fashioned merchants strive to\r\nobtain for themselves. They do not dream of grand cordons--that is far\r\nbeyond their most sanguine expectations--but they do all in their power\r\nto obtain those lesser decorations which are granted to the mercantile\r\nclass. For this purpose the most common expedient is a liberal\r\nsubscription to some benevolent institution, and occasionally a regular\r\nbargain is made. I know of at least one instance where the kind of\r\ndecoration was expressly stipulated. The affair illustrates so well the\r\ncommercial character of these transactions that I venture to state the\r\nfacts as related to me by the official chiefly concerned. A merchant\r\nsubscribed to a society which enjoyed the patronage of a Grand Duchess\r\na considerable sum of money, under the express condition that he\r\nshould receive in return a St. Vladimir Cross. Instead of the desired\r\ndecoration, which was considered too much for the sum subscribed, a\r\ncross of St. Stanislas was granted; but the donor was dissatisfied with\r\nthe latter and demanded that his money should be returned to him. The\r\ndemand had to be complied with, and, as an Imperial gift cannot be\r\nretracted, the merchant had his Stanislas Cross for nothing.\r\n\r\nThis traffic in decorations has had its natural result. Like paper money\r\nissued in too large quantities, the decorations have fallen in value.\r\nThe gold medals which were formerly much coveted and worn with pride by\r\nthe rich merchants--suspended by a ribbon round the neck--are now\r\nlittle sought after. In like manner the inordinate respect for official\r\npersonages has considerably diminished. Fifty years ago the provincial\r\nmerchants vied with each other in their desire to entertain any great\r\ndignitary who honoured their town with a visit, but now they seek rather\r\nto avoid this expensive and barren honour. When they do accept the\r\nhonour, they fulfil the duties of hospitality in a most liberal spirit.\r\nI have sometimes, when living as an honoured guest in a rich merchant\u0027s\r\nhouse, found it difficult to obtain anything simpler than sterlet,\r\nsturgeon, and champagne.\r\n\r\nThe two great blemishes on the character of the Russian merchants as\r\na class are, according to general opinion, their ignorance and their\r\ndishonesty. As to the former of these there cannot possibly be any\r\ndifference of opinion. Many of them can neither read nor write, and are\r\nforced to keep their accounts in their memory, or by means of ingenious\r\nhieroglyphics, intelligible only to the inventor. Others can decipher\r\nthe calendar and the lives of the saints, can sign their names with\r\ntolerable facility, and can make the simpler arithmetical calculations\r\nwith the help of the stchety, a little calculating instrument, composed\r\nof wooden balls strung on brass wires, which resembles the \"abaca\"\r\nof the old Romans, and is universally used in Russia. It is only the\r\nminority who understand the mysteries of regular book-keeping, and of\r\nthese very few can make any pretensions to being educated men.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is rapidly undergoing a radical change. Children are\r\nnow much better educated than their parents, and the next generation\r\nwill doubtless make further progress, so that the old-fashioned type\r\nabove described is destined to disappear. Already there are not a few\r\nof the younger generation--especially among the wealthy manufacturers\r\nof Moscow--who have been educated abroad, who may be described as tout\r\na fait civilises, and whose mode of life differs little from that of\r\nthe richer nobles; but they remain outside fashionable society, and\r\nconstitute a \"set\" of their own.\r\n\r\nAs to the dishonesty which is said to be so common among the Russian\r\ncommercial classes, it is difficult to form an accurate judgment. That\r\nan enormous amount of unfair dealing does exist there can be no possible\r\ndoubt, but in this matter a foreigner is likely to be unduly severe. We\r\nare apt to apply unflinchingly our own standard of commercial morality,\r\nand to forget that trade in Russia is only emerging from that primitive\r\ncondition in which fixed prices and moderate profits are entirely\r\nunknown. And when we happen to detect positive dishonesty, it seems to\r\nus especially heinous, because the trickery employed is more primitive\r\nand awkward than that to which we are accustomed. Trickery in weighing\r\nand measuring, for instance, which is by no means uncommon in Russia,\r\nis likely to make us more indignant than those ingenious methods of\r\nadulteration which are practised nearer home, and are regarded by many\r\nas almost legitimate. Besides this, foreigners who go to Russia and\r\nembark in speculations without possessing any adequate knowledge of\r\nthe character, customs, and language of the people positively invite\r\nspoliation, and ought to blame themselves rather than the people who\r\nprofit by their ignorance.\r\n\r\nAll this, and much more of the same kind, may be fairly urged in\r\nmitigation of the severe judgments which foreign merchants commonly pass\r\non Russian commercial morality, but these judgments cannot be reversed\r\nby such argumentation. The dishonesty and rascality which exist among\r\nthe merchants are fully recognised by the Russians themselves. In all\r\nmoral affairs the lower classes in Russia are very lenient in their\r\njudgments, and are strongly disposed, like the Americans, to admire\r\nwhat is called in Transatlantic phraseology \"a smart man,\" though the\r\nsmartness is known to contain a large admixture of dishonesty; and yet\r\nthe vox populi in Russia emphatically declares that the merchants as a\r\nclass are unscrupulous and dishonest. There is a rude popular play in\r\nwhich the Devil, as principal dramatis persona, succeeds in cheating all\r\nmanner and conditions of men, but is finally overreached by a genuine\r\nRussian merchant. When this play is acted in the Carnival Theatre in St.\r\nPetersburg the audience invariably agrees with the moral of the plot.\r\n\r\nIf this play were acted in the southern towns near the coast of the\r\nBlack Sea it would be necessary to modify it considerably, for here,\r\nin company with Jews, Greeks, and Armenians, the Russian merchants seem\r\nhonest by comparison. As to Greeks and Armenians, I know not which of\r\nthe two nationalities deserves the palm, but it seems that both are\r\nsurpassed by the Children of Israel. \"How these Jews do business,\"\r\nI have heard a Russian merchant of this region exclaim, \"I cannot\r\nunderstand. They buy up wheat in the villages at eleven roubles per\r\ntchetvert, transport it to the coast at their own expense, and sell it\r\nto the exporters at ten roubles! And yet they contrive to make a profit!\r\nIt is said that the Russian trader is cunning, but here \u0027our brother\u0027\r\n[i.e., the Russian] can do nothing.\" The truth of this statement I have\r\nhad abundant opportunities of confirming by personal investigations on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nIf I might express a general opinion regarding Russian commercial\r\nmorality, I should say that trade in Russia is carried on very much on\r\nthe same principle as horse-dealing in England. A man who wishes to buy\r\nor sell must trust to his own knowledge and acuteness, and if he gets\r\nthe worst of a bargain or lets himself be deceived, he has himself to\r\nblame. Commercial Englishmen on arriving in Russia rarely understand\r\nthis, and when they know it theoretically they are too often unable,\r\nfrom their ignorance of the language, the laws, and the customs of the\r\npeople, to turn their theoretical knowledge to account. They indulge,\r\ntherefore, at first in endless invectives against the prevailing\r\ndishonesty; but gradually, when they have paid what Germans call\r\nLehrgeld, they accommodate themselves to circumstances, take large\r\nprofits to counterbalance bad debts, and generally succeed--if they have\r\nsufficient energy, mother-wit, and capital--in making a very handsome\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nThe old race of British merchants, however, is rapidly dying out, and I\r\ngreatly fear that the rising generation will not be equally successful.\r\nTimes have changed. It is no longer possible to amass large fortunes\r\nin the old easy-going fashion. Every year the conditions alter, and\r\nthe competition increases. In order to foresee, understand, and take\r\nadvantage of the changes, one must have far more knowledge of the\r\ncountry than the men of the old school possessed, and it seems to me\r\nthat the young generation have still less of that knowledge than their\r\npredecessors. Unless some change takes place in this respect, the German\r\nmerchants, who have generally a much better commercial education and are\r\nmuch better acquainted with their adopted country, will ultimately, I\r\nbelieve, expel their British rivals. Already many branches of commerce\r\nformerly carried on by Englishmen have passed into their hands.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the unsatisfactory organisation of the\r\nRussian commercial world is the result of any radical peculiarity of\r\nthe Russian character. All new countries have to pass through a similar\r\nstate of things, and in Russia there are already premonitory symptoms\r\nof a change for the better. For the present, it is true, the extensive\r\nconstruction of railways and the rapid development of banks and limited\r\nliability companies have opened up a new and wide field for all kinds\r\nof commercial swindling; but, on the other hand, there are now in every\r\nlarge town a certain number of merchants who carry on business in the\r\nWest-European manner, and have learnt by experience that honesty is\r\nthe best policy. The success which many of these have obtained will\r\ndoubtless cause their example to be followed. The old spirit of caste\r\nand routine which has long animated the merchant class is rapidly\r\ndisappearing, and not a few nobles are now exchanging country life and\r\nthe service of the State for industrial and commercial enterprises.\r\nIn this way is being formed the nucleus of that wealthy, enlightened\r\nbourgeoisie which Catherine endeavoured to create by legislation; but\r\nmany years must elapse before this class acquires sufficient social and\r\npolitical significance to deserve the title of a tiers-etat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PASTORAL TRIBES OF THE STEPPE\r\n\r\n\r\nA Journey to the Steppe Region of the Southeast--The Volga--Town\r\nand Province of Samara--Farther Eastward--Appearance of the\r\nVillages--Characteristic Incident--Peasant Mendacity--Explanation of the\r\nPhenomenon--I Awake in Asia--A Bashkir Aoul--Diner la Tartare--Kumyss--A\r\nBashkir Troubadour--Honest Mehemet Zian--Actual Economic Condition of\r\nthe Bashkirs Throws Light on a Well-known Philosophical Theory--Why\r\na Pastoral Race Adopts Agriculture--The Genuine Steppe--The\r\nKirghiz--Letter from Genghis Khan--The Kalmyks--Nogai Tartars--Struggle\r\nbetween Nomadic Hordes and Agricultural Colonists.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had spent a couple of years or more in the Northern and\r\nNorth-Central provinces--the land of forests and of agriculture\r\nconducted on the three-field system, with here and there a town of\r\nrespectable antiquity--I determined to visit for purposes of comparison\r\nand contrast the Southeastern region, which possesses no forests nor\r\nancient towns, and corresponds to the Far West of the United States of\r\nAmerica. My point of departure was Yaroslavl, a town on the right bank\r\nof the Volga to the northeast of Moscow--and thence I sailed down the\r\nriver during three days on a large comfortable steamer to Samara, the\r\nchief town of the province or \"government\" of the name. Here I left the\r\nsteamer and prepared to make a journey into the eastern hinterland.\r\n\r\nSamara is a new town, a child of the last century. At the time of\r\nmy first visit, now thirty years ago, it recalled by its unfinished\r\nappearance the new towns of America. Many of the houses were of wood.\r\nThe streets were still in such a primitive condition that after rain\r\nthey were almost impassable from mud, and in dry, gusty weather they\r\ngenerated thick clouds of blinding, suffocating dust. Before I had been\r\nmany days in the place I witnessed a dust-hurricane, during which it was\r\nimpossible at certain moments to see from my window the houses on\r\nthe other side of the street. Amidst such primitive surroundings the\r\ncolossal new church seemed a little out of keeping, and it occurred\r\nto my practical British mind that some of the money expended on its\r\nconstruction might have been more profitably employed. But the Russians\r\nhave their own ideas of the fitness of things. Religious after their\r\nown fashion, they subscribe money liberally for ecclesiastical\r\npurposes--especially for the building and decoration of their churches.\r\nBesides this, the Government considers that every chief town of a\r\nprovince should possess a cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn its early days Samara was one of the outposts of Russian\r\ncolonisation, and had often to take precautions against the raids of the\r\nnomadic tribes living in the vicinity; but the agricultural frontier has\r\nsince been pushed far forward to the east and south, and the province\r\nwas until lately, despite occasional droughts, one of the most\r\nproductive in the Empire. The town is the chief market of this region,\r\nand therein lies its importance. The grain is brought by the peasants\r\nfrom great distances, and stored in large granaries by the merchants,\r\nwho send it to Moscow or St. Petersburg. In former days this was a very\r\ntedious operation. The boats containing the grain were towed by horses\r\nor stout peasants up the rivers and through the canals for hundreds of\r\nmiles. Then came the period of \"cabestans\"--unwieldly machines propelled\r\nby means of anchors and windlasses. Now these primitive methods of\r\ntransport have disappeared. The grain is either despatched by rail\r\nor put into gigantic barges, which are towed up the river by powerful\r\ntug-steamers to some point connected with the great network of railways.\r\n\r\nWhen the traveller has visited the Cathedral and the granaries he has\r\nseen all the lions--not very formidable lions, truly--of the place. He\r\nmay then inspect the kumyss establishments, pleasantly situated near\r\nthe town. He will find there a considerable number of patients--mostly\r\nconsumptive--who drink enormous quantities of fermented mare\u0027s-milk,\r\nand who declare that they receive great benefit from this modern\r\nhealth-restorer.\r\n\r\nWhat interested me more than the lions of the town or the suburban\r\nkumyss establishments were the offices of the local administration,\r\nwhere I found in the archives much statistical and other information\r\nof the kind I was in search of, regarding the economic condition of\r\nthe province generally, and of the emancipated peasantry in particular.\r\nHaving filled my note-book with material of this sort, I proceeded to\r\nverify and complete it by visiting some characteristic villages and\r\nquestioning the inhabitants. For the student of Russian affairs who\r\nwishes to arrive at real, as distinguished from official, truth, this is\r\nnot an altogether superfluous operation.\r\n\r\nWhen I had thus made the acquaintance of the sedentary agricultural\r\npopulation in several districts I journeyed eastwards with the intention\r\nof visiting the Bashkirs, a Tartar tribe which still preserved--so at\r\nleast I was assured--its old nomadic habits. My reasons for undertaking\r\nthis journey were twofold. In the first place I was desirous of seeing\r\nwith my own eyes some remnants of those terrible nomadic tribes\r\nwhich had at one time conquered Russia and long threatened to overrun\r\nEurope--those Tartar hordes which gained, by their irresistible force\r\nand relentless cruelty, the reputation of being \"the scourge of God.\"\r\nBesides this, I had long wished to study the conditions of pastoral\r\nlife, and congratulated myself on having found a convenient opportunity\r\nof doing so.\r\n\r\nAs I proceeded eastwards I noticed a change in the appearance of the\r\nvillages. The ordinary wooden houses, with their high sloping roofs,\r\ngradually gave place to flat-roofed huts, built of a peculiar kind of\r\nunburnt bricks, composed of mud and straw. I noticed, too, that the\r\npopulation became less and less dense, and the amount of fallow land\r\nproportionately greater. The peasants were evidently richer than those\r\nnear the Volga, but they complained--as the Russian peasant always\r\ndoes--that they had not land enough. In answer to my inquiries why they\r\ndid not use the thousands of acres that were lying fallow around them,\r\nthey explained that they had already raised crops on that land for\r\nseveral successive years, and that consequently they must now allow it\r\nto \"rest.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of the villages through which I passed I met with a very\r\ncharacteristic little incident. The village was called Samovolnaya\r\nIvanofka--that is to say, \"Ivanofka the Self-willed\" or \"the\r\nNon-authorised.\" Whilst our horses were being changed my travelling\r\ncompanion, in the course of conversation with a group of peasants,\r\ninquired about the origin of this extraordinary name, and discovered a\r\ncurious bit of local history. The founders of the village had settled on\r\nthe land without the permission of the absentee owner, and obstinately\r\nresisted all attempts at eviction. Again and again troops had been\r\nsent to drive them away, but as soon as the troops retired these\r\n\"self-willed\" people returned and resumed possession, till at last the\r\nproprietor, who lived in St. Petersburg or some other distant place,\r\nbecame weary of the contest and allowed them to remain. The various\r\nincidents were related with much circumstantial detail, so that\r\nthe narration lasted perhaps half an hour. All this time I listened\r\nattentively, and when the story was finished I took out my note-book\r\nin order to jot down the facts, and asked in what year the affair had\r\nhappened. No answer was given to my question. The peasants merely looked\r\nat each other in a significant way and kept silence. Thinking that my\r\nquestion had not been understood, I asked it a second time, repeating a\r\npart of what had been related. To my astonishment and utter discomfiture\r\nthey all declared that they had never related anything of the sort!\r\nIn despair I appealed to my friend, and asked him whether my ears had\r\ndeceived me--whether I was labouring under some strange hallucination.\r\nWithout giving me any reply he simply smiled and turned away.\r\n\r\nWhen we had left the village and were driving along in our tarantass the\r\nmystery was satisfactorily cleared up. My friend explained to me that I\r\nhad not at all misunderstood what had been related, but that my\r\nabrupt question and the sight of my note-book had suddenly aroused the\r\npeasants\u0027 suspicions. \"They evidently suspected,\" he continued, \"that\r\nyou were a tchinovnik, and that you wished to use to their detriment the\r\nknowledge you had acquired. They thought it safer, therefore, at once to\r\ndeny it all. You don\u0027t yet understand the Russian muzhik!\"\r\n\r\nIn this last remark I was obliged to concur, but since that time I have\r\ncome to know the muzhik better, and an incident of the kind would now\r\nno longer surprise me. From a long series of observations I have come\r\nto the conclusion that the great majority of the Russian peasants, when\r\ndealing with the authorities, consider the most patent and barefaced\r\nfalsehoods as a fair means of self-defence. Thus, for example, when\r\na muzhik is implicated in a criminal affair, and a preliminary\r\ninvestigation is being made, he probably begins by constructing an\r\nelaborate story to explain the facts and exculpate himself. The story\r\nmay be a tissue of self-evident falsehoods from beginning to end, but\r\nhe defends it valiantly as long as possible. When he perceives that the\r\nposition which he has taken up is utterly untenable, he declares\r\nopenly that all he has said is false, and that he wishes to make a\r\nnew declaration. This second declaration may have the same fate as the\r\nformer one, and then he proposes a third. Thus groping his way, he\r\ntries various stories till he finds one that seems proof against all\r\nobjections. In the fact of his thus telling lies there is of course\r\nnothing remarkable, for criminals in all parts of the world have a\r\ntendency to deviate from the truth when they fall into the hands of\r\njustice. The peculiarity is that he retracts his statements with the\r\ncomposed air of a chess-player who requests his opponent to let him take\r\nback an inadvertent move. Under the old system of procedure, which was\r\nabolished in the sixties, clever criminals often contrived by means of\r\nthis simple device to have their trial postponed for many years.\r\n\r\nSuch incidents naturally astonish a foreigner, and he is apt, in\r\nconsequence, to pass a very severe judgment on the Russian peasantry\r\nin general. The reader may remember Karl Karl\u0027itch\u0027s remarks on the\r\nsubject. These remarks I have heard repeated in various forms by Germans\r\nin all parts of the country, and there must be a certain amount of truth\r\nin them, for even an eminent Slavophil once publicly admitted that the\r\npeasant is prone to perjury.* It is necessary, however, as it seems to\r\nme, to draw a distinction. In the ordinary intercourse of peasants\r\namong themselves, or with people in whom they have confidence, I do not\r\nbelieve that the habit of lying is abnormally developed. It is only when\r\nthe muzhik comes in contact with authorities that he shows himself an\r\nexpert fabricator of falsehoods. In this there is nothing that need\r\nsurprise us. For ages the peasantry were exposed to the arbitrary power\r\nand ruthless exactions of those who were placed over them; and as the\r\nlaw gave them no means of legally protecting themselves, their only\r\nmeans of self-defence lay in cunning and deceit.\r\n\r\n     * Kireyefski, in the Russakaya Beseda.\r\n\r\nWe have here, I believe, the true explanation of that \"Oriental\r\nmendacity\" about which Eastern travellers have written so much. It is\r\nsimply the result of a lawless state of society. Suppose a truth-loving\r\nEnglishman falls into the hands of brigands or savages. Will he not, if\r\nhe have merely an ordinary moral character, consider himself justified\r\nin inventing a few falsehoods in order to effect his escape? If so, we\r\nhave no right to condemn very severely the hereditary mendacity of those\r\nraces which have lived for many generations in a position analogous\r\nto that of the supposed Englishman among brigands. When legitimate\r\ninterests cannot be protected by truthfulness and honesty, prudent\r\npeople always learn to employ means which experience has proved to be\r\nmore effectual. In a country where the law does not afford protection,\r\nthe strong man defends himself by his strength, the weak by cunning and\r\nduplicity. This fully explains the fact that in Turkey the Christians\r\nare less truthful than the Mahometans.\r\n\r\nBut we have wandered a long way from the road to Bashkiria. Let us\r\ntherefore return at once.\r\n\r\nOf all the journeys which I made in Russia this was one of the most\r\nagreeable. The weather was bright and warm, without being unpleasantly\r\nhot; the roads were tolerably smooth; the tarantass, which had been\r\nhired for the whole journey, was nearly as comfortable as a tarantass\r\ncan be; good milk, eggs, and white bread could be obtained in abundance;\r\nthere was not much difficulty in procuring horses in the villages\r\nthrough which we passed, and the owners of them were not very\r\nextortionate in their demands. But what most contributed to my comfort\r\nwas that I was accompanied by an agreeable, intelligent young Russian,\r\nwho kindly undertook to make all the necessary arrangements, and I\r\nwas thereby freed from those annoyances and worries which are always\r\nencountered in primitive countries where travelling is not yet a\r\nrecognised institution. To him I left the entire control of our\r\nmovements, passively acquiescing in everything, and asking no questions\r\nas to what was coming. Taking advantage of my passivity, he prepared for\r\nme one evening a pleasant little surprise.\r\n\r\nAbout sunset we had left a village called Morsha, and shortly\r\nafterwards, feeling drowsy, and being warned by my companion that\r\nwe should have a long, uninteresting drive, I had lain down in the\r\ntarantass and gone to sleep. On awaking I found that the tarantass had\r\nstopped, and that the stars were shining brightly overhead. A big\r\ndog was barking furiously close at hand, and I heard the voice of the\r\nyamstchik informing us that we had arrived. I at once sat up and looked\r\nabout me, expecting to see a village of some kind, but instead of that\r\nI perceived a wide open space, and at a short distance a group of\r\nhaystacks. Close to the tarantass stood two figures in long cloaks,\r\narmed with big sticks, and speaking to each other in an unknown tongue.\r\nMy first idea was that we had been somehow led into a trap, so I drew\r\nmy revolver in order to be ready for all emergencies. My companion was\r\nstill snoring loudly by my side, and stoutly resisted all my efforts to\r\nawaken him.\r\n\r\n\"What\u0027s this?\" I said, in a gruff, angry voice, to the yamstchik. \"Where\r\nhave you taken us to?\"\r\n\r\n\"To where I was ordered, master!\"\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of getting a more satisfactory explanation I took to\r\nshaking my sleepy companion, but before he had returned to consciousness\r\nthe moon shone out brightly from behind a thick bank of clouds, and\r\ncleared up the mystery. The supposed haystacks turned out to be\r\ntents. The two figures with long sticks, whom I had suspected of being\r\nbrigands, were peaceable shepherds, dressed in the ordinary Oriental\r\nkhalát, and tending their sheep, which were grazing close by. Instead\r\nof being in an empty hay-field, as I had imagined, we had before us a\r\nregular Tartar aoul, such as I had often read about. For a moment I felt\r\nastonished and bewildered. It seemed to me that I had fallen asleep in\r\nEurope and woke up in Asia!\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we were comfortably installed in one of the tents,\r\na circular, cupola-shaped erection, of about twelve feet in diameter,\r\ncomposed of a frame-work of light wooden rods covered with thick felt.\r\nIt contained no furniture, except a goodly quantity of carpets and\r\npillows, which had been formed into a bed for our accommodation. Our\r\namiable host, who was evidently somewhat astonished at our unexpected\r\nvisit, but refrained from asking questions, soon bade us good-night\r\nand retired. We were not, however, left alone. A large number of black\r\nbeetles remained and gave us a welcome in their own peculiar fashion.\r\nWhether they were provided with wings, or made up for the want of flying\r\nappliances by crawling up the sides of the tent and dropping down on any\r\nobject they wished to reach, I did not discover, but certain it is that\r\nthey somehow reached our heads--even when we were standing upright--and\r\nclung to our hair with wonderful tenacity. Why they should show such\r\na marked preference for human hair we could not conjecture, till it\r\noccurred to us that the natives habitually shaved their heads, and that\r\nthese beetles must naturally consider a hair-covered cranium a curious\r\nnovelty deserving of careful examination. Like all children of nature\r\nthey were decidedly indiscreet and troublesome in their curiosity, but\r\nwhen the light was extinguished they took the hint and departed.\r\n\r\nWhen we awoke next morning it was broad daylight, and we found a crowd\r\nof natives in front of the tent. Our arrival was evidently regarded as\r\nan important event, and all the inhabitants of the aoul were anxious\r\nto make our acquaintance. First our host came forward. He was a short,\r\nslimly-built man, of middle age, with a grave, severe expression,\r\nindicating an unsociable disposition. We afterwards learned that he\r\nwas an akhun*--that is to say, a minor officer of the Mahometan\r\necclesiastical administration, and at the same time a small trader in\r\nsilken and woollen stuffs. With him came the mullah, or priest, a portly\r\nold gentleman with an open, honest face of the European type, and a\r\nfine grey beard. The other important members of the little community\r\nfollowed. They were all swarthy in colour, and had the small eyes and\r\nprominent cheek-bones which are characteristic of the Tartar races, but\r\nthey had little of that flatness of countenance and peculiar ugliness\r\nwhich distinguish the pure Mongol. All of them, with the exception of\r\nthe mullah, spoke a little Russian, and used it to assure us that we\r\nwere welcome. The children remained respectfully in the background, and\r\nthe women, with faces veiled, eyed us furtively from the doors of the\r\ntents.\r\n\r\n     * I presume this is the same word as akhund, well known on\r\n     the Northwest frontier of India, where it was applied\r\n     specially to the late ruler of Svat.\r\n\r\nThe aoul consisted of about twenty tents, all constructed on the same\r\nmodel, and scattered about in sporadic fashion, without the least regard\r\nto symmetry. Close by was a watercourse, which appears on some maps as\r\na river, under the name of Karalyk, but which was at that time merely a\r\nsuccession of pools containing a dark-coloured liquid. As we more than\r\nsuspected that these pools supplied the inhabitants with water for\r\nculinary purposes, the sight was not calculated to whet our appetites.\r\nWe turned away therefore hurriedly, and for want of something better\r\nto do we watched the preparations for dinner. These were decidedly\r\nprimitive. A sheep was brought near the door of our tent, and there\r\nkilled, skinned, cut up into pieces, and put into an immense pot, under\r\nwhich a fire had been kindled.\r\n\r\nThe dinner itself was not less primitive than the manner of preparing\r\nit. The table consisted of a large napkin spread in the middle of the\r\ntent, and the chairs were represented by cushions, on which we\r\nsat cross-legged. There were no plates, knives, forks, spoons, or\r\nchopsticks. Guests were expected all to eat out of a common wooden bowl,\r\nand to use the instruments with which Nature had provided them. The\r\nservice was performed by the host and his son. The fare was copious, but\r\nnot varied--consisting entirely of boiled mutton, without bread or other\r\nsubstitute, and a little salted horse-flesh thrown in as an entree.\r\n\r\nTo eat out of the same dish with half-a-dozen Mahometans who accept\r\ntheir Prophet\u0027s injunction about ablutions in a highly figurative sense,\r\nand who are totally unacquainted with the use of forks and spoons,\r\nis not an agreeable operation, even if one is not much troubled with\r\nreligious prejudices; but with these Bashkirs something worse than this\r\nhas to be encountered, for their favourite method of expressing their\r\nesteem and affection for one with whom they are eating consists in\r\nputting bits of mutton, and sometimes even handfuls of hashed meat,\r\ninto his month! When I discovered this unexpected peculiarity in Bashkir\r\nmanners and customs, I almost regretted that I had made a favourable\r\nimpression upon my new acquaintances.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheep had been devoured, partly by the company in the tent and\r\npartly by a nondescript company outside--for the whole aoul took part\r\nin the festivities--kumyss was served in unlimited quantities. This\r\nbeverage, as I have already explained, is mare\u0027s milk fermented; but\r\nwhat here passed under the name was very different from the kumyss I\r\nhad tasted in the establissements of Samara. There it was a pleasant\r\neffervescing drink, with only the slightest tinge of acidity; here\r\nit was a \"still\" liquid, strongly resembling very thin and very sour\r\nbutter-milk. My Russian friend made a wry face on first tasting it, and\r\nI felt inclined at first to do likewise, but noticing that his grimaces\r\nmade an unfavourable impression on the audience, I restrained my facial\r\nmuscles, and looked as if I liked it. Very soon I really came to like\r\nit, and learned to \"drink fair\" with those who had been accustomed to it\r\nfrom their childhood. By this feat I rose considerably in the estimation\r\nof the natives; for if one does not drink kumyss one cannot be sociable\r\nin the Bashkir sense of the term, and by acquiring the habit one adopts\r\nan essential principle of Bashkir nationality. I should certainly have\r\npreferred having a cup of it to myself, but I thought it well to conform\r\nto the habits of the country, and to accept the big wooden bowl when it\r\nwas passed round. In return my friends made an important concession in\r\nmy favour: they allowed me to smoke as I pleased, though they considered\r\nthat, as the Prophet had refrained from tobacco, ordinary mortals should\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nWhilst the \"loving-cup\" was going round I distributed some small\r\npresents which I had brought for the purpose, and then proceeded to\r\nexplain the object of my visit. In the distant country from which I\r\ncame--far away to the westward--I had heard of the Bashkirs as a\r\npeople possessing many strange customs, but very kind and hospitable\r\nto strangers. Of their kindness and hospitality I had already learned\r\nsomething by experience, and I hoped they would allow me to learn\r\nsomething of their mode of life, their customs, their songs, their\r\nhistory, and their religion, in all of which I assured them my distant\r\ncountrymen took a lively interest.\r\n\r\nThis little after-dinner speech was perhaps not quite in accordance\r\nwith Bashkir etiquette, but it made a favourable impression. There was\r\na decided murmur of approbation, and those who understood Russian\r\ntranslated my words to their less accomplished brethren. A short\r\nconsultation ensued, and then there was a general shout of \"Abdullah!\r\nAbdullah!\" which was taken up and repeated by those standing outside.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Abdullah appeared, with a big, half-picked bone in his\r\nhand, and the lower part of his face besmeared with grease. He was a\r\nshort, thin man, with a dark, sallow complexion, and a look of premature\r\nold age; but the suppressed smile that played about his mouth and a\r\ntremulous movement of his right eye-lid showed plainly that he had not\r\nyet forgotten the fun and frolic of youth. His dress was of richer and\r\nmore gaudy material, but at the same time more tawdry and tattered, than\r\nthat of the others. Altogether he looked like an artiste in distressed\r\ncircumstances, and such he really was. At a word and a sign from the\r\nhost he laid aside his bone and drew from under his green silk khalát a\r\nsmall wind-instrument resembling a flute or flageolet. On this he played\r\na number of native airs. The first melodies which he played reminded me\r\nof a Highland pibroch--at one moment low, solemn, and plaintive,\r\nthen gradually rising into a soul-stirring, martial strain, and again\r\ndescending to a plaintive wail. The amount of expression which he put\r\ninto his simple instrument was truly marvellous. Then, passing suddenly\r\nfrom grave to gay, he played a series of light, merry airs, and some\r\nof the younger onlookers got up and performed a dance as boisterous and\r\nungraceful as an Irish jig.\r\n\r\nThis Abdullah turned out to be for me a most valuable acquaintance.\r\nHe was a kind of Bashkir troubadour, well acquainted not only with the\r\nmusic, but also with the traditions, the history, the superstitions, and\r\nthe folk-lore of his people. By the akhun and the mullah he was regarded\r\nas a frivolous, worthless fellow, who had no regular, respectable means\r\nof gaining a livelihood, but among the men of less rigid principles he\r\nwas a general favourite. As he spoke Russian fluently I could converse\r\nwith him freely without the aid of an interpreter, and he willingly\r\nplaced his store of knowledge at my disposal. When in the company of the\r\nakhun he was always solemn and taciturn, but as soon as he was relieved\r\nof that dignitary\u0027s presence he became lively and communicative.\r\n\r\nAnother of my new acquaintances was equally useful to me in another way.\r\nThis was Mehemet Zian, who was not so intelligent as Abdullah, but\r\nmuch more sympathetic. In his open, honest face, and kindly, unaffected\r\nmanner there was something so irresistibly attractive that before I had\r\nknown him twenty-four hours a sort of friendship had sprung up between\r\nus. He was a tall, muscular, broad-shouldered man, with features that\r\nsuggested a mixture of European blood. Though already past middle\r\nage, he was still wiry and active--so active that he could, when on\r\nhorseback, pick a stone off the ground without dismounting. He could,\r\nhowever, no longer perform this feat at full gallop, as he had been wont\r\nto do in his youth. His geographical knowledge was extremely limited and\r\ninaccurate--his mind being in this respect like those old Russian maps\r\nin which the nations of the earth and a good many peoples who had\r\nnever more than a mythical existence are jumbled together in\r\nhopeless confusion--but his geographical curiosity was insatiable. My\r\ntravelling-map--the first thing of the kind he had ever seen--interested\r\nhim deeply. When he found that by simply examining it and glancing at my\r\ncompass I could tell him the direction and distance of places he\r\nknew, his face was like that of a child who sees for the first time\r\na conjuror\u0027s performance; and when I explained the trick to him, and\r\ntaught him to calculate the distance to Bokhara--the sacred city of\r\nthe Mussulmans of that region--his delight was unbounded. Gradually I\r\nperceived that to possess such a map had become the great object of his\r\nambition. Unfortunately I could not at once gratify him as I should have\r\nwished, because I had a long journey before me and I had no other map\r\nof the region, but I promised to find ways and means of sending him one,\r\nand I kept my word by means of a native of the Karalyk district whom I\r\ndiscovered in Samara. I did not add a compass because I could not find\r\none in the town, and it would have been of little use to him: like a\r\ntrue child of nature he always knew the cardinal points by the sun or\r\nthe stars. Some years later I had the satisfaction of learning that the\r\nmap had reached its destination safely, through no less a personage\r\nthan Count Tolstoy. One evening at the home of a friend in Moscow I\r\nwas presented to the great novelist, and as soon as he heard my name he\r\nsaid: \"Oh! I know you already, and I know your friend Mehemet Zian. When\r\nI passed a night this summer in his aoul he showed me a map with your\r\nsignature on the margin, and taught me how to calculate the distance to\r\nBokhara!\"\r\n\r\nIf Mehemet knew little of foreign countries he was thoroughly well\r\nacquainted with his own, and repaid me most liberally for my elementary\r\nlessons in geography. With him I visited the neighbouring aouls. In all\r\nof them he had numerous acquaintances, and everywhere we were received\r\nwith the greatest hospitality, except on one occasion when we paid a\r\nvisit of ceremony to a famous robber who was the terror of the whole\r\nneighbourhood. Certainly he was one of the most brutalised specimens of\r\nhumanity I have ever encountered. He made no attempt to be amiable,\r\nand I felt inclined to leave his tent at once; but I saw that my friend\r\nwanted to conciliate him, so I restrained my feelings and eventually\r\nestablished tolerably good relations with him. As a rule I avoided\r\nfestivities, partly because I knew that my hosts were mostly poor and\r\nwould not accept payment for the slaughtered sheep, and partly because\r\nI had reason to apprehend that they would express to me their esteem\r\nand affection more Bashkirico; but in kumyss-drinking, the ordinary\r\noccupation of these people when they have nothing to do, I had to\r\nindulge to a most inordinate extent. On these expeditions Abdullah\r\ngenerally accompanied us, and rendered valuable service as interpreter\r\nand troubadour. Mehemet could express himself in Russian, but his\r\nvocabulary failed him as soon as the conversation ran above very\r\nordinary topics; Abdullah, on the contrary, was a first-rate\r\ninterpreter, and under the influence of his musical pipe and lively\r\ntalkativeness new acquaintances became sociable and communicative. Poor\r\nAbdullah! He was a kind of universal genius; but his faded, tattered\r\nkhalát showed only too plainly that in Bashkiria, as in more civilised\r\ncountries, universal genius and the artistic temperament lead to poverty\r\nrather than to wealth.\r\n\r\nI have no intention of troubling the reader with the miscellaneous\r\nfacts which, with the assistance of these two friends, I succeeded in\r\ncollecting--indeed, I could not if I would, for the notes I then made\r\nwere afterwards lost--but I wish to say a few words about the actual\r\neconomic condition of the Bashkirs. They are at present passing from\r\npastoral to agricultural life; and it is not a little interesting to\r\nnote the causes which induce them to make this change, and the way in\r\nwhich it is made.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have long held a theory of social development according\r\nto which men were at first hunters, then shepherds, and lastly\r\nagriculturists. How far this theory is in accordance with reality we\r\nneed not for the present inquire, but we may examine an important part\r\nof it and ask ourselves the question, Why did pastoral tribes adopt\r\nagriculture? The common explanation is that they changed their mode of\r\nlife in consequence of some ill-defined, fortuitous circumstances. A\r\ngreat legislator arose amongst them and taught them to till the soil, or\r\nthey came in contact with an agricultural race and adopted the customs\r\nof their neighbours. Such explanations must appear unsatisfactory to\r\nany one who has lived with a pastoral people. Pastoral life is so\r\nincomparably more agreeable than the hard lot of the agriculturist, and\r\nso much more in accordance with the natural indolence of human nature,\r\nthat no great legislator, though he had the wisdom of a Solon and the\r\neloquence of a Demosthenes, could possibly induce his fellow-countrymen\r\nto pass voluntarily from the one to the other. Of all the ordinary\r\nmeans of gaining a livelihood--with the exception perhaps of\r\nmining--agriculture is the most laborious, and is never voluntarily\r\nadopted by men who have not been accustomed to it from their childhood.\r\nThe life of a pastoral race, on the contrary, is a perennial holiday,\r\nand I can imagine nothing except the prospect of starvation which could\r\ninduce men who live by their flocks and herds to make the transition to\r\nagricultural life.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of starvation is, in fact, the cause of the\r\ntransition--probably in all cases, and certainly in the case of the\r\nBashkirs. So long as they had abundance of pasturage they never thought\r\nof tilling the soil. Their flocks and herds supplied them with all that\r\nthey required, and enabled them to lead a tranquil, indolent existence.\r\nNo great legislator arose among them to teach them the use of the plough\r\nand the sickle, and when they saw the Russian peasants on their borders\r\nlaboriously ploughing and reaping, they looked on them with compassion,\r\nand never thought of following their example. But an impersonal\r\nlegislator came to them--a very severe and tyrannical legislator,\r\nwho would not brook disobedience--I mean Economic Necessity. By\r\nthe encroachments of the Ural Cossacks on the east, and by the\r\never-advancing wave of Russian colonisation from the north and west,\r\ntheir territory had been greatly diminished. With diminution of the\r\npasturage came diminution of the live stock, their sole means of\r\nsubsistence. In spite of their passively conservative spirit they had to\r\nlook about for some new means of obtaining food and clothing--some new\r\nmode of life requiring less extensive territorial possessions. It was\r\nonly then that they began to think of imitating their neighbours. They\r\nsaw that the neighbouring Russian peasant lived comfortably on thirty or\r\nforty acres of land, whilst they possessed a hundred and fifty acres per\r\nmale, and were in danger of starvation.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this was self-evident--they ought\r\nat once to begin ploughing and sowing. But there was a very serious\r\nobstacle to the putting of this principle in practice. Agriculture\r\ncertainly requires less land than sheep-farming, but it requires very\r\nmuch more labour, and to hard work the Bashkirs were not accustomed.\r\nThey could bear hardships and fatigues in the shape of long journeys\r\non horseback, but the severe, monotonous labour of the plough and the\r\nsickle was not to their taste. At first, therefore, they adopted a\r\ncompromise. They had a portion of their land tilled by Russian peasants,\r\nand ceded to these a part of the produce in return for the labour\r\nexpended; in other words, they assumed the position of landed\r\nproprietors, and farmed part of their land on the metayage system.\r\n\r\nThe process of transition had reached this point in several aouls which\r\nI visited. My friend Mehemet Zian showed me at some distance from the\r\ntents his plot of arable land, and introduced me to the peasant who\r\ntilled it--a Little-Russian, who assured me that the arrangement\r\nsatisfied all parties. The process of transition cannot, however, stop\r\nhere. The compromise is merely a temporary expedient. Virgin soil gives\r\nvery abundant harvests, sufficient to support both the labourer and the\r\nindolent proprietor, but after a few years the soil becomes exhausted\r\nand gives only a very moderate revenue. A proprietor, therefore, must\r\nsooner or later dispense with the labourers who take half of the produce\r\nas their recompense, and must himself put his hand to the plough.\r\n\r\nThus we see the Bashkirs are, properly speaking, no longer a purely\r\npastoral, nomadic people. The discovery of this fact caused me some\r\nlittle disappointment, and in the hope of finding a tribe in a more\r\nprimitive condition I visited the Kirghiz of the Inner Horde, who occupy\r\nthe country to the southward, in the direction of the Caspian. Here for\r\nthe first time I saw the genuine Steppe in the full sense of the term--a\r\ncountry level as the sea, with not a hillock or even a gentle\r\nundulation to break the straight line of the horizon, and not a patch\r\nof cultivation, a tree, a bush, or even a stone, to diversify the\r\nmonotonous expanse.\r\n\r\nTraversing such a region is, I need scarcely say, very weary work--all\r\nthe more as there are no milestones or other landmarks to show the\r\nprogress you are making. Still, it is not so overwhelmingly wearisome\r\nas might be supposed. In the morning you may watch the vast lakes,\r\nwith their rugged promontories and well-wooded banks, which the mirage\r\ncreates for your amusement. Then during the course of the day there are\r\nalways one or two trifling incidents which arouse you for a little from\r\nyour somnolence. Now you descry a couple of horsemen on the distant\r\nhorizon, and watch them as they approach; and when they come alongside\r\nyou may have a talk with them if you know the language or have an\r\ninterpreter; or you may amuse yourself with a little pantomime, if\r\narticulate speech is impossible. Now you encounter a long train of\r\ncamels marching along with solemn, stately step, and speculate as to\r\nthe contents of the big packages with which they are laden. Now you\r\nencounter the carcass of a horse that has fallen by the wayside, and\r\nwatch the dogs and the steppe eagles fighting over their prey; and if\r\nyou are murderously inclined you may take a shot with your revolver at\r\nthese great birds, for they are ignorantly brave, and will sometimes\r\nallow you to approach within twenty or thirty yards. At last you\r\nperceive--most pleasant sight of all--a group of haystack-shaped tents\r\nin the distance; and you hurry on to enjoy the grateful shade, and\r\nquench your thirst with \"deep, deep draughts\" of refreshing kumyss.\r\n\r\nDuring my journey through the Kirghiz country I was accompanied by a\r\nRussian gentleman, who had provided himself with a circular letter from\r\nthe hereditary chieftain of the Horde, a personage who rejoiced in the\r\nimposing name of Genghis Khan,* and claimed to be a descendant of the\r\ngreat Mongol conqueror. This document assured us a good reception in the\r\naouls through which we passed. Every Kirghis who saw it treated it with\r\nprofound respect, and professed to put all his goods and chattels at our\r\nservice. But in spite of this powerful recommendation we met with none\r\nof the friendly cordiality and communicativeness which I had found among\r\nthe Bashkirs. A tent with an unlimited quantity of cushions was always\r\nset apart for our accommodation; the sheep were killed and boiled for\r\nour dinner, and the pails of kumyss were regularly brought for our\r\nrefreshment; but all this was evidently done as a matter of duty and not\r\nas a spontaneous expression of hospitality. When we determined once or\r\ntwice to prolong our visit beyond the term originally announced, I could\r\nperceive that our host was not at all delighted by the change of our\r\nplans. The only consolation we had was that those who entertained\r\nus made no scruples about accepting payment for the food and shelter\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n     * I have adopted the ordinary English spelling of this name.\r\n     The Kirghiz and the Russians pronounce it \"Tchinghiz.\"\r\n\r\nFrom all this I have no intention of drawing the conclusion that the\r\nKirghiz are, as a people, inhospitable or unfriendly to strangers. My\r\nexperience of them is too limited to warrant any such inference. The\r\nletter of Genghis Khan insured us all the accommodation we required,\r\nbut it at the same time gave us a certain official character not at all\r\nfavourable to the establishment of friendly relations. Those with whom\r\nwe came in contact regarded us as Russian officials, and suspected us of\r\nhaving some secret designs. As I endeavoured to discover the number\r\nof their cattle, and to form an approximate estimate of their annual\r\nrevenue, they naturally feared--having no conception of disinterested\r\nscientific curiosity--that these data were being collected for the\r\npurpose of increasing the taxes, or with some similar intention of a\r\nsinister kind. Very soon I perceived clearly that any information we\r\nmight here collect regarding the economic conditions of pastoral life\r\nwould not be of much value, and I postponed my proposed studies to a\r\nmore convenient season.\r\n\r\nThe Kirghiz are, ethnographically speaking, closely allied to the\r\nBashkirs, but differ from them both in physiognomy and language. Their\r\nfeatures approach much nearer the pure Mongol type, and their language\r\nis a distinct dialect, which a Bashkir or a Tartar of Kazan has some\r\ndifficulty in understanding. They are professedly Mahometans, but their\r\nMahometanism is not of a rigid kind, as may be seen by the fact that\r\ntheir women do not veil their faces even in the presence of Ghiaours--a\r\nlaxness of which the Ghiaour will certainly not approve if he happen to\r\nbe sensitive to female beauty and ugliness. Their mode of life differs\r\nfrom that of the Bashkirs, but they have proportionately more land and\r\nare consequently still able to lead a purely pastoral life. Near their\r\nwestern frontier, it is true, they annually let patches of land to\r\nthe Russian peasants for the purpose of raising crops; but these\r\nencroachments can never advance very far, for the greater part of their\r\nterritory is unsuited to agriculture, on account of a large admixture\r\nof salt in the soil. This fact will have an important influence on\r\ntheir future. Unlike the Bashkirs, who possess good arable land, and\r\nare consequently on the road to become agriculturists, they will in all\r\nprobability continue to live exclusively by their flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nTo the southwest of the Lower Volga, in the flat region lying to the\r\nnorth of the Caucasus, we find another pastoral tribe, the Kalmyks,\r\ndiffering widely from the two former in language, in physiognomy, and\r\nin religion. Their language, a dialect of the Mongolian, has no close\r\naffinity with any other language in this part of the world. In respect\r\nof religion they are likewise isolated, for they are Buddhists, and have\r\nconsequently no co-religionists nearer than Mongolia or Thibet. But it\r\nis their physiognomy that most strikingly distinguishes them from the\r\nsurrounding peoples, and stamps them as Mongols of the purest water.\r\nThere is something almost infra-human in their ugliness. They show in\r\nan exaggerated degree all those repulsive traits which we see toned down\r\nand refined in the face of an average Chinaman; and it is difficult,\r\nwhen we meet them for the first time, to believe that a human soul lurks\r\nbehind their expressionless, flattened faces and small, dull, obliquely\r\nset eyes. If the Tartar and Turkish races are really descended from\r\nancestors of that type, then we must assume that they have received in\r\nthe course of time a large admixture of Aryan or Semitic blood.\r\n\r\nBut we must not be too hard on the poor Kalmyks, or judge of their\r\ncharacter by their unprepossessing appearance. They are by no means so\r\nunhuman as they look. Men who have lived among them have assured me that\r\nthey are decidedly intelligent, especially in all matters relating to\r\ncattle, and that they are--though somewhat addicted to cattle-lifting\r\nand other primitive customs not tolerated in the more advanced stages\r\nof civilisation--by no means wanting in some of the better qualities of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\nFormerly there was a fourth pastoral tribe in this region--the Nogai\r\nTartars. They occupied the plains to the north of the Sea of Azof, but\r\nthey are no longer to be found there. Shortly after the Crimean war\r\nthey emigrated to Turkey, and their lands are now occupied by Russian,\r\nGerman, Bulgarian, and Montenegrin colonists.\r\n\r\nAmong the pastoral tribes of this region the Kalmyks are recent\r\nintruders. They first appeared in the seventeenth century, and were long\r\nformidable on account of their great numbers and compact organisation;\r\nbut in 1771 the majority of them suddenly struck their tents and\r\nretreated to their old home in the north of the Celestial Empire. Those\r\nwho remained were easily pacified, and have long since lost, under the\r\ninfluence of unbroken peace and a strong Russian administration, their\r\nold warlike spirit. Their latest military exploits were performed during\r\nthe last years of the Napoleonic wars, and were not of a very serious\r\nkind; a troop of them accompanied the Russian army, and astonished\r\nWestern Europe by their uncouth features, their strange costume, and\r\ntheir primitive accoutrements, among which their curious bows and arrows\r\nfigured conspicuously.\r\n\r\nThe other pastoral tribes which I have mentioned--Bashkirs, Kirghiz, and\r\nNogai Tartars--are the last remnants of the famous marauders who from\r\ntime immemorial down to a comparatively recent period held the vast\r\nplains of Southern Russia. The long struggle between them and the\r\nagricultural colonists from the northwest, closely resembling the long\r\nstruggle between the Red-skins and the white settlers on the prairies of\r\nNorth America, forms an important page of Russian history.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the warlike nomads stoutly resisted all encroachments on\r\ntheir pasture-grounds, and considered cattle-lifting, kidnapping, and\r\npillage as a legitimate and honorable occupation. \"Their raids,\" says an\r\nold Byzantine writer, \"are as flashes of lightning, and their retreat is\r\nat once heavy and light--heavy from booty and light from the swiftness\r\nof their movements. For them a peaceful life is a misfortune, and a\r\nconvenient opportunity for war is the height of felicity. Worst of\r\nall, they are more numerous than bees in spring, their numbers are\r\nuncountable.\" \"Having no fixed place of abode,\" says another Byzantine\r\nauthority, \"they seek to conquer all lands and colonise none. They are\r\nflying people, and therefore cannot be caught. As they have neither\r\ntowns nor villages, they must be hunted like wild beasts, and can be\r\nfitly compared only to griffins, which beneficent Nature has banished to\r\nuninhabited regions.\" As a Persian distich, quoted by Vambery, has it--\r\n\r\n     \"They came, conquered, burned,\r\n     pillaged, murdered, and went.\"\r\n\r\nTheir raids are thus described by an old Russian chronicler: \"They burn\r\nthe villages, the farmyards, and the churches. The land is turned by\r\nthem into a desert, and the overgrown fields become the lair of wild\r\nbeasts. Many people are led away into slavery; others are tortured and\r\nkilled, or die from hunger and thirst. Sad, weary, stiff from cold, with\r\nfaces wan from woe, barefoot or naked, and torn by the thistles, the\r\nRussian prisoners trudge along through an unknown country, and, weeping,\r\nsay to one another, \u0027I am from such a town, and I from such a village.\u0027\"\r\nAnd in harmony with the monastic chroniclers we hear the nameless\r\nSlavonic Ossian wailing for the fallen sons of Rus: \"In the Russian land\r\nis rarely heard the voice of the husbandman, but often the cry of the\r\nvultures, fighting with each other over the bodies of the slain; and the\r\nravens scream as they fly to the spoil.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the stubborn resistance of the nomads the wave of\r\ncolonisation moved steadily onwards until the first years of the\r\nthirteenth century, when it was suddenly checked and thrown back. A\r\ngreat Mongolian horde from Eastern Asia, far more numerous and better\r\norganized than the local nomadic tribes, overran the whole country,\r\nand for more than two centuries Russia was in a certain sense ruled\r\nby Mongol Khans. As I wish to speak at some length of this Mongol\r\ndomination, I shall devote to it a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MONGOL DOMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conquest--Genghis Khan and his People--Creation and Rapid\r\nDisintegration of the Mongol Empire--The Golden Horde--The Real\r\nCharacter of the Mongol Domination--Religious Toleration--Mongol System\r\nof Government--Grand Princes--The Princes of Moscow--Influence of the\r\nMongol Domination--Practical Importance of the Subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tartar invasion, with its direct and indirect consequences, is\r\na subject which has more than a mere antiquarian interest. To the\r\ninfluence of the Mongols are commonly attributed many peculiarities\r\nin the actual condition and national character of the Russians of the\r\npresent day, and some writers would even have us believe that the\r\nmen whom we call Russians are simply Tartars half disguised by a thin\r\nvarnish of European civilisation. It may be well, therefore, to inquire\r\nwhat the Tartar or Mongol domination really was, and how far it affected\r\nthe historical development and national character of the Russian people.\r\n\r\nThe story of the conquest may be briefly told. In 1224 the chieftains\r\nof the Poloftsi--one of those pastoral tribes which roamed on the Steppe\r\nand habitually carried on a predatory warfare with the Russians of\r\nthe south--sent deputies to Mistislaf the Brave, Prince of Galicia, to\r\ninform him that their country had been invaded from the southeast by\r\nstrong, cruel enemies called Tartars*--strange-looking men with brown\r\nfaces, eyes small and wide apart, thick lips, broad shoulders, and black\r\nhair. \"Today,\" said the deputies, \"they have seized our country, and\r\ntomorrow they will seize yours if you do not help us.\"\r\n\r\n     * The word is properly \"Tatar,\" and the Russians write and\r\n     pronounce it in this way, but I have preferred to retain the\r\n     better known form.\r\n\r\nMistislaf had probably no objection to the Poloftsi being annihilated\r\nby some tribe stronger and fiercer than themselves, for they gave him\r\na great deal of trouble by their frequent raids; but he perceived the\r\nforce of the argument about his own turn coming next, and thought\r\nit wise to assist his usually hostile neighbours. For the purpose of\r\nwarding off the danger he called together the neighbouring Princes,\r\nand urged them to join him in an expedition against the new enemy. The\r\nexpedition was undertaken, and ended in disaster. On the Kalka, a small\r\nriver falling into the Sea of Azof, the Russian host met the invaders,\r\nand was completely routed. The country was thereby opened to the\r\nvictors, but they did not follow up their advantage. After advancing for\r\nsome distance they suddenly wheeled round and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThus ended unexpectedly the first visit of these unwelcome strangers.\r\nThirteen years afterwards they returned, and were not so easily got rid\r\nof. An enormous horde crossed the River Ural and advanced into the heart\r\nof the country, pillaging, burning, devastating, and murdering. Nowhere\r\ndid they meet with serious resistance. The Princes made no attempt to\r\ncombine against the common enemy. Nearly all the principal towns were\r\nlaid in ashes, and the inhabitants were killed or carried off as slaves.\r\nHaving conquered Russia, they advanced westward, and threw all Europe\r\ninto alarm. The panic reached even England, and interrupted, it is said,\r\nfor a time the herring fishing on the coast. Western Europe, however,\r\nescaped their ravages. After visiting Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Servia,\r\nand Dalmatia, they retreated to the Lower Volga, and the Russian Princes\r\nwere summoned thither to do homage to the victorious Khan.\r\n\r\nAt first the Russians had only very vague notions as to who this\r\nterrible enemy was. The old chronicler remarks briefly: \"For our sins\r\nunknown peoples have appeared. No one knows who they are or whence they\r\nhave come, or to what race and faith they belong. They are commonly\r\ncalled Tartars, but some call them Tauermen, and others Petchenegs. Who\r\nthey really are is known only to God, and perhaps to wise men deeply\r\nread in books.\" Some of these \"wise men deeply read in books\" supposed\r\nthem to be the idolatrous Moabites who had in Old Testament times\r\nharassed God\u0027s chosen people, whilst others thought that they must be\r\nthe descendants of the men whom Gideon had driven out, of whom a revered\r\nsaint had prophesied that they would come in the latter days and conquer\r\nthe whole earth, from the East even unto the Euphrates, and from the\r\nTigris even unto the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nWe are now happily in a position to dispense with such vague\r\nethnographical speculations. From the accounts of several European\r\ntravellers who visited Tartary about that time, and from the writings of\r\nvarious Oriental historians, we know a great deal about these barbarians\r\nwho conquered Russia and frightened the Western nations.\r\n\r\nThe vast region lying to the east of Russia, from the basin of the Volga\r\nto the shores of the Pacific Ocean, was inhabited then, as it is still,\r\nby numerous Tartar and Mongol tribes. These two terms are often regarded\r\nas identical and interchangeable, but they ought, I think, to be\r\ndistinguished. From the ethnographic, the linguistic, and the religious\r\npoint of view they differ widely from each other. The Kazan Tartars,\r\nthe Bashkirs, the Kirghiz, in a word, all the tribes in the country\r\nstretching latitudinally from the Volga to Kashgar, and longitudinally\r\nfrom the Persian frontier, the Hindu Kush and the Northern Himalaya, to\r\na line drawn east and west through the middle of Siberia, belong to the\r\nTartar group; whereas those further eastward, occupying Mongolia and\r\nManchuria, are Mongol in the stricter sense of the term.\r\n\r\nA very little experience enables the traveller to distinguish between\r\nthe two. Both of them have the well-known characteristics of the\r\nNorthern Asiatic--the broad flat face, yellow skin, small, obliquely set\r\neyes, high cheekbones, thin, straggling beard; but these traits are more\r\nstrongly marked, more exaggerated, if we may use such an expression,\r\nin the Mongol than in the Tartar. Thus the Mongol is, according to our\r\nconceptions, by far the uglier of the two, and the man of Tartar\r\nrace, when seen beside him, appears almost European by comparison. The\r\ndistinction is confirmed by a study of their languages. All the Tartar\r\nlanguages are closely allied, so that a person of average linguistic\r\ntalent who has mastered one of them, whether it be the rude Turki of\r\nCentral Asia or the highly polished Turkish of Stambul, can easily\r\nacquire any of the others; whereas even an extensive acquaintance with\r\nthe Tartar dialects will be of no practical use to him in learning a\r\nlanguage of the Mongol group. In their religions likewise the two races\r\ndiffer. The Mongols are as a rule Shamanists or Buddhists, while the\r\nTartars are Mahometans. Some of the Mongol invaders, it is true, adopted\r\nMahometanism from the conquered Tartar tribes, and by this change of\r\nreligion, which led naturally to intermarriage, their descendants became\r\ngradually blended with the older population; but the broad line of\r\ndistinction was not permanently effaced.\r\n\r\nIt is often supposed, even by people who profess to be acquainted with\r\nRussian history, that Mongols and Tartars alike first came westward to\r\nthe frontiers of Europe with Genghis Khan. This is true of the Mongols,\r\nbut so far as the Tartars are concerned it is an entire mistake. From\r\ntime immemorial the Tartar tribes roamed over these territories. Like\r\nthe Russians, they were conquered by the Mongol invaders and had long to\r\npay tribute, and when the Mongol empire crumbled to pieces by internal\r\ndissensions and finally disappeared before the victorious advance of the\r\nRussians, the Tartars reappeared from the confusion without having lost,\r\nnotwithstanding an intermixture doubtless of Mongol blood, their\r\nold racial characteristics, their old dialects, and their old tribal\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the vast horde which swept over Asia and advanced into the\r\ncentre of Europe was a small pastoral tribe of Mongols living in the\r\nhilly country to the north of China, near the sources of the Amur. This\r\ntribe was neither more warlike nor more formidable than its neighbours\r\ntill near the close of the twelfth century, when there appeared in it\r\na man who is described as \"a mighty hunter before the Lord.\" Of him and\r\nhis people we have a brief description by a Chinese author of the time:\r\n\"A man of gigantic stature, with broad forehead and long beard, and\r\nremarkable for his bravery. As to his people, their faces are broad,\r\nflat, and four-cornered, with prominent cheek-bones; their eyes have\r\nno upper eyelashes; they have very little hair in their beards and\r\nmoustaches; their exterior is very repulsive.\" This man of gigantic\r\nstature was no other than Genghis Khan. He began by subduing and\r\nincorporating into his army the surrounding tribes, conquered with their\r\nassistance a great part of Northern China, and then, leaving one of his\r\ngenerals to complete the conquest of the Celestial Empire, he led his\r\narmy westward with the ambitious design of conquering the whole world.\r\n\"As there is but one God in heaven,\" he was wont to say, \"so there\r\nshould be but one ruler on earth\"; and this one universal ruler he\r\nhimself aspired to be.\r\n\r\nA European army necessarily diminishes in force and its existence\r\nbecomes more and more imperilled as it advances from its base of\r\noperations into a foreign and hostile country. Not so a horde like that\r\nof Genghis Khan in a country such as that which it had to traverse. It\r\nneeded no base of operations, for it took with it its flocks, its tents,\r\nand all its worldly goods. Properly speaking, it was not an army at all,\r\nbut rather a people in movement. The grassy Steppes fed the flocks, and\r\nthe flocks fed the warriors; and with such a simple commissariat system\r\nthere was no necessity for keeping up communications with the point\r\nof departure. Instead of diminishing in numbers, the horde constantly\r\nincreased as it moved forwards. The nomadic tribes which it encountered\r\non its way, composed of men who found a home wherever they found pasture\r\nand drinking-water, required little persuasion to make them join the\r\nonward movement. By means of this terrible instrument of conquest\r\nGenghis succeeded in creating a colossal Empire, stretching from the\r\nCarpathians to the eastern shores of Asia, and from the Arctic Ocean to\r\nthe Himalayas.\r\n\r\nGenghis was no mere ruthless destroyer; he was at the same time one\r\nof the greatest administrators the world has ever seen. But his\r\nadministrative genius could not work miracles. His vast Empire, founded\r\non conquest and composed of the most heterogeneous elements, had no\r\nprinciple of organic life in it, and could not possibly be long-lived.\r\nIt had been created by him, and it perished with him. For some time\r\nafter his death the dignity of Grand Khan was held by some one of his\r\ndescendants, and the centralised administration was nominally preserved;\r\nbut the local rulers rapidly emancipated themselves from the central\r\nauthority, and within half a century after the death of its founder the\r\ngreat Mongol Empire was little more than \"a geographical expression.\"\r\n\r\nWith the dismemberment of the short-lived Empire the danger for Eastern\r\nEurope was by no means at an end. The independent hordes were scarcely\r\nless formidable than the Empire itself. A grandson of Genghis formed\r\non the Russian frontier a new State, commonly known as Kiptchak, or the\r\nGolden Horde, and built a capital called Serai, on one of the arms of\r\nthe Lower Volga. This capital, which has since so completely disappeared\r\nthat there is some doubt as to its site, is described by Ibn Batuta,\r\nwho visited it in the fifteenth century, as a very great, populous, and\r\nbeautiful city, possessing many mosques, fine market-places, and broad\r\nstreets, in which were to be seen merchants from Babylon, Egypt, Syria,\r\nand other countries. Here lived the Khans of the Golden Horde, who kept\r\nRussia in subjection for two centuries.\r\n\r\nIn conquering Russia the Mongols had no wish to possess themselves of\r\nthe soil, or to take into their own hands the local administration. What\r\nthey wanted was not land, of which they had enough and to spare,\r\nbut movable property which they might enjoy without giving up their\r\npastoral, nomadic life. They applied, therefore, to Russia the same\r\nmethod of extracting supplies as they had used in other countries.\r\nAs soon as their authority had been formally acknowledged they sent\r\nofficials into the country to number the inhabitants and to collect an\r\namount of tribute proportionate to the population. This was a severe\r\nburden for the people, not only on account of the sum demanded, but\r\nalso on account of the manner in which it was raised. The exactions\r\nand cruelty of the tax-gatherers led to local insurrections, and the\r\ninsurrections were of course always severely punished. But there was\r\nnever any general military occupation of the country or any wholesale\r\nconfiscations of land, and the existing political organisation was left\r\nundisturbed. The modern method of dealing with annexed provinces was\r\ntotally unknown to the Mongols. The Khans never thought of attempting\r\nto denationalise their Russian subjects. They demanded simply an oath\r\nof allegiance from the Princes* and a certain sum of tribute from\r\nthe people. The vanquished were allowed to retain their land, their\r\nreligion, their language, their courts of justice, and all their other\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n     * During the Mongol domination Russia was composed of a\r\n     large number of independent principalities.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Mongol domination is well illustrated by the policy\r\nwhich the conquerors adopted towards the Russian Church. For more than\r\nhalf a century after the conquest the religion of the Tartars was\r\na mixture of Buddhism and Paganism, with traces of Sabaeism or\r\nfire-worship. During this period Christianity was more than simply\r\ntolerated. The Grand Khan Kuyuk caused a Christian chapel to be erected\r\nnear his domicile, and one of his successors, Khubilai, was in the habit\r\nof publicly taking part in the Easter festivals. In 1261 the Khan of the\r\nGolden Horde allowed the Russians to found a bishopric in his capital,\r\nand several members of his family adopted Christianity. One of them\r\neven founded a monastery, and became a saint of the Russian Church! The\r\nOrthodox clergy were exempted from the poll-tax, and in the charters\r\ngranted to them it was expressly declared that if any one committed\r\nblasphemy against the faith of the Russians he should be put to death.\r\nSome time afterwards the Golden Horde was converted to Islam, but the\r\nKhans did not on that account change their policy. They continued\r\nto favour the clergy, and their protection was long remembered. Many\r\ngenerations later, when the property of the Church was threatened by the\r\nautocratic power, refractory ecclesiastics contrasted the policy of\r\nthe Orthodox Sovereign with that of the \"godless Tartars,\" much to the\r\nadvantage of the latter.\r\n\r\nAt first there was and could be very little mutual confidence between\r\nthe conquerors and the conquered. The Princes anxiously looked for an\r\nopportunity of throwing off the galling yoke, and the people chafed\r\nunder the exactions and cruelty of the tribute-collectors, whilst\r\nthe Khans took precautions to prevent insurrection, and threatened to\r\ndevastate the country if their authority was not respected. But in the\r\ncourse of time this mutual distrust and hostility greatly lessened. When\r\nthe Princes found by experience that all attempts at resistance were\r\nfruitless, they became reconciled to their new position, and instead\r\nof seeking to throw off the Khan\u0027s authority, they tried to gain his\r\nfavour, in the hope of forwarding their personal interests. For this\r\npurpose they paid frequent visits to the Tartar Suzerain, made rich\r\npresents to his wives and courtiers, received from him charters\r\nconfirming their authority, and sometimes even married members of his\r\nfamily. Some of them used the favour thus acquired for extending their\r\npossessions at the expense of neighbouring Princes of their own race,\r\nand did not hesitate to call in Tartar hordes to their assistance.\r\nThe Khans, in their turn, placed greater confidence in their vassals,\r\nentrusted them with the task of collecting the tribute, recalled their\r\nown officials who were a constant eyesore to the people, and abstained\r\nfrom all interference in the internal affairs of the principalities so\r\nlong as the tribute was regularly paid. The Princes acted, in short, as\r\nthe Khan\u0027s lieutenants, and became to a certain extent Tartarised. Some\r\nof them carried this policy so far that they were reproached by the\r\npeople with \"loving beyond measure the Tartars and their language, and\r\nwith giving them too freely land, and gold, and goods of every kind.\"\r\n\r\nHad the Khans of the Golden Horde been prudent, far-seeing statesmen,\r\nthey might have long retained their supremacy over Russia. In reality\r\nthey showed themselves miserably deficient in political talent. Seeking\r\nmerely to extract from the country as much tribute as possible,\r\nthey overlooked all higher considerations, and by this culpable\r\nshortsightedness prepared their own political ruin. Instead of keeping\r\nall the Russian Princes on the same level and thereby rendering them all\r\nequally feeble, they were constantly bribed or cajoled into giving to\r\none or more of their vassals a pre-eminence over the others. At first\r\nthis pre-eminence consisted in little more than the empty title of\r\nGrand Prince; but the vassals thus favoured soon transformed the\r\nbarren distinction into a genuine power by arrogating to themselves the\r\nexclusive right of holding direct communications with the Horde, and\r\ncompelling the minor Princes to deliver to them the Mongol tribute.\r\nIf any of the lesser Princes refused to acknowledge this intermediate\r\nauthority, the Grand Prince could easily crush them by representing them\r\nat the Horde as rebels. Such an accusation would cause the accused to be\r\nsummoned before the Supreme Tribunal, where the procedure was extremely\r\nsummary and the Grand Prince had always the means of obtaining a\r\ndecision in his own favour.\r\n\r\nOf the Princes who strove in this way to increase their influence,\r\nthe most successful were the Grand Princes of Moscow. They were not a\r\nchivalrous race, or one with which the severe moralist can sympathise,\r\nbut they were largely endowed with cunning, tact, and perseverance, and\r\nwere little hampered by conscientious scruples. Having early discovered\r\nthat the liberal distribution of money at the Tartar court was the\r\nsurest means of gaining favour, they lived parsimoniously at home and\r\nspent their savings at the Horde. To secure the continuance of the\r\nfavour thus acquired, they were ready to form matrimonial alliances\r\nwith the Khan\u0027s family, and to act zealously as his lieutenants. When\r\nNovgorod, the haughty, turbulent republic, refused to pay the yearly\r\ntribute, they quelled the insurrection and punished the leaders; and\r\nwhen the inhabitants of Tver rose against the Tartars and compelled\r\ntheir Prince to make common cause with them, the wily Muscovite\r\nhastened to the Tartar court and received from the Khan the revolted\r\nprincipality, with 50,000 Tartars to support his authority.\r\n\r\nThus those cunning Moscow Princes \"loved the Tartars beyond measure\" so\r\nlong as the Khan was irresistibly powerful, but as his power waned they\r\nstood forth as his rivals. When the Golden Horde, like the great Empire\r\nof which it had once formed a part, fell to pieces in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, these ambitious Princes read the signs of the times, and put\r\nthemselves at the head of the liberation movement, which was at first\r\nunsuccessful, but ultimately freed the country from the hated yoke.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief sketch of the Mongol domination the reader will readily\r\nunderstand that it did not leave any deep, lasting impression on\r\nthe people. The invaders never settled in Russia proper, and never\r\namalgamated with the native population. So long as they retained their\r\nsemi-pagan, semi-Buddhistic religion, a certain number of their notables\r\nbecame Christians and were absorbed by the Russian Noblesse; but as\r\nsoon as the Horde adopted Islam this movement was arrested. There was no\r\nblending of the two races such as has taken place--and is still taking\r\nplace--between the Russian peasantry and the Finnish tribes of the\r\nNorth. The Russians remained Christians, and the Tartars remained\r\nMahometans; and this difference of religion raised an impassable barrier\r\nbetween the two nationalities.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that the Tartar domination, though it\r\nhad little influence on the life and habits of the people, had a\r\nconsiderable influence on the political development of the nation.\r\nAt the time of the conquest Russia was composed of a large number of\r\nindependent principalities, all governed by descendants of Rurik. As\r\nthese principalities were not geographical or ethnographical units, but\r\nmere artificial, arbitrarily defined districts, which were regularly\r\nsubdivided or combined according to the hereditary rights of the\r\nPrinces, it is highly probable that they would in any case have been\r\nsooner or later united under one sceptre; but it is quite certain that\r\nthe policy of the Khans helped to accelerate this unification and to\r\ncreate the autocratic power which has since been wielded by the Tsars.\r\nIf the principalities had been united without foreign interference we\r\nshould probably have found in the united State some form of political\r\norganisation corresponding to that which existed in the component\r\nparts--some mixed form of government, in which the political power would\r\nhave been more or less equally divided between the Tsar and the people.\r\nThe Tartar rule interrupted this normal development by extinguishing\r\nall free political life. The first Tsars of Muscovy were the political\r\ndescendants, not of the old independent Princes, but of the Mongol\r\nKhans. It may be said, therefore, that the autocratic power, which\r\nhas been during the last four centuries out of all comparison the most\r\nimportant factor in Russian history, was in a certain sense created by\r\nthe Mongol domination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE COSSACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nLawlessness on the Steppe--Slave-markets of the Crimea--The Military\r\nCordon and the Free Cossacks--The Zaporovian Commonwealth Compared with\r\nSparta and with the Mediaeval Military Orders--The Cossacks of the Don,\r\nof the Volga, and of the Ural--Border Warfare--The Modern Cossacks--Land\r\nTenure among the Cossacks of the Don--The Transition from Pastoral to\r\nAgriculture Life--\"Universal Law\" of Social Development--Communal versus\r\nPrivate Property--Flogging as a Means of Land-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Grand Princes of Moscow thrown off the Mongol yoke\r\nand become independent Tsars of Muscovy than they began that eastward\r\nterritorial expansion which has been going on steadily ever since, and\r\nwhich culminated in the occupation of Talienwan and Port Arthur. Ivan\r\nthe Terrible conquered the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan (1552-54)\r\nand reduced to nominal subjection the Bashkir and Kirghiz tribes in the\r\nvicinity of the Volga, but he did not thereby establish law and order on\r\nthe Steppe. The lawless tribes retained their old pastoral mode of life\r\nand predatory habits, and harassed the Russian agricultural population\r\nof the outlying provinces in the same way as the Red Indians in America\r\nused to harass the white colonists of the Far West. A large section\r\nof the Horde, inhabiting the Crimea and the Steppe to the north of the\r\nBlack Sea, escaped annexation by submitting to the Ottoman Turks and\r\nbecoming tributaries of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nThe Turks were at that time a formidable power, with which the Tsars of\r\nMuscovy were too weak to cope successfully, and the Khan of the Crimea\r\ncould always, when hard pressed by his northern neighbours, obtain\r\nassistance from Constantinople. This potentate exercised a nominal\r\nauthority over the pastoral tribes which roamed on the Steppe between\r\nthe Crimea and the Russian frontier, but he had neither the power\r\nnor the desire to control their aggressive tendencies. Their raids in\r\nRussian and Polish territory ensured, among other advantages, a regular\r\nand plentiful supply of slaves, which formed the chief article of export\r\nfrom Kaffa--the modern Theodosia--and from the other seaports of the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nOf this slave trade, which flourished down to 1783, when the Crimea was\r\nfinally conquered and annexed by Russia, we have a graphic account by\r\nan eye-witness, a Lithuanian traveller of the sixteenth century. \"Ships\r\nfrom Asia,\" he says, \"bring arms, clothes, and horses to the Crimean\r\nTartars, and start on the homeward voyage laden with slaves. It is for\r\nthis kind of merchandise alone that the Crimean markets are remarkable.\r\nSlaves may be always had for sale as a pledge or as a present, and every\r\none rich enough to have a horse deals in them. If a man wishes to buy\r\nclothes, arms, or horses, and does not happen to have at the moment any\r\nslaves, he takes on credit the articles required, and makes a formal\r\npromise to deliver at a certain time a certain number of people of\r\nour blood--being convinced that he can get by that time the requisite\r\nnumber. And these promises are always accurately fulfilled, as if those\r\nwho made them had always a supply of our people in their courtyards.\r\nA Jewish money-changer, sitting at the gate of Tauris and seeing\r\nconstantly the countless multitude of our countrymen led in as captives,\r\nasked us whether there still remained any people in our land, and whence\r\ncame such a multitude of them. The stronger of these captives, branded\r\non the forehead and cheeks and manacled or fettered, are tortured by\r\nsevere labour all day, and are shut up in dark cells at night. They are\r\nkept alive by small quantities of food, composed chiefly of the flesh of\r\nanimals that have died--putrid, covered with maggots, disgusting even\r\nto dogs. Women, who are more tender, are treated in a different fashion;\r\nsome of them who can sing and play are employed to amuse the guests at\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\n\"When the slaves are led out for sale they walk to the marketplace in\r\nsingle file, like storks on the wing, in whole dozens, chained together\r\nby the neck, and are there sold by auction. The auctioneer shouts loudly\r\nthat they are \u0027the newest arrivals, simple, and not cunning, lately\r\ncaptured from the people of the kingdom (Poland), and not from Muscovy\u0027;\r\nfor the Muscovite race, being crafty and deceitful, does not bring a\r\ngood price. This kind of merchandise is appraised with great accuracy in\r\nthe Crimea, and is bought by foreign merchants at a high price, in order\r\nto be sold at a still higher rate to blacker nations, such as Saracens,\r\nPersians, Indians, Arabs, Syrians, and Assyrians. When a purchase\r\nis made the teeth are examined, to see that they are neither few nor\r\ndiscoloured. At the same time the more hidden parts of the body are\r\ncarefully inspected, and if a mole, excrescence, wound, or other latent\r\ndefect is discovered, the bargain is rescinded. But notwithstanding\r\nthese investigations the cunning slave-dealers and brokers succeed in\r\ncheating the buyers; for when they have valuable boys and girls, they\r\ndo not at once produce them, but first fatten them, clothe them in silk,\r\nand put powder and rouge on their cheeks, so as to sell them at a better\r\nprice. Sometimes beautiful and perfect maidens of our nation bring their\r\nweight in gold. This takes place in all the towns of the peninsula, but\r\nespecially in Kaffa.\"*\r\n\r\n     * Michalonis Litvani, \"De moribus Tartarorum Fragmina,\" X.,\r\n     Basilliae, 1615.\r\n\r\nTo protect the agricultural population of the Steppe against the raids\r\nof these thieving, cattle-lifting, kidnapping neighbours, the Tsars of\r\nMuscovy and the Kings of Poland built forts, constructed palisades, dug\r\ntrenches, and kept up a regular military cordon. The troops composing\r\nthis cordon were called Cossacks; but these were not the \"Free Cossacks\"\r\nbest known to history and romance. These latter lived beyond the\r\nfrontier on the debatable land which lay between the two hostile races,\r\nand there they formed self-governing military communities. Each one of\r\nthe rivers flowing southwards--the Dnieper, the Don, the Volga, and the\r\nYaik or Ural--was held by a community of these Free Cossacks, and no\r\none, whether Christian or Tartar, was allowed to pass through their\r\nterritory without their permission.\r\n\r\nOfficially the Free Cossacks were Russians, for they professed to be\r\nchampions of Orthodox Christianity, and--with the exception of those\r\nof the Dnieper--loyal subjects of the Tsar; but in reality they were\r\nsomething different. Though they were Russian by origin, language, and\r\nsympathy, the habit of kidnapping Tartar women introduced among them a\r\ncertain admixture of Tartar blood. Though self-constituted champions of\r\nChristianity and haters of Islam, they troubled themselves very little\r\nwith religion, and did not submit to the ecclesiastical authorities.\r\nAs to their religious status, it cannot be easily defined. Whilst\r\nprofessing allegiance and devotion to the Tsar, they did not think it\r\nnecessary to obey him, except in so far as his orders suited their own\r\nconvenience. And the Tsar, it must be confessed, acted towards them in a\r\nsimilar fashion. When he found it convenient he called them his faithful\r\nsubjects; and when complaints were made to him about their raids in\r\nTurkish territory, he declared that they were not his subjects, but\r\nrunaways and brigands, and that the Sultan might punish them as he saw\r\nfit. At the same time, the so-called runaways and brigands regularly\r\nreceived supplies and ammunition from Moscow, as is amply proved by\r\nrecently-published documents. Down to the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury the Cossacks of the Dnieper stood in a similar relation to\r\nthe Polish kings; but at that time they threw off their allegiance to\r\nPoland, and became subjects of the Tsars of Muscovy.\r\n\r\nOf these semi-independent military communities, which formed a\r\ncontinuous barrier along the southern and southeastern frontier, the\r\nmost celebrated were the Zaporovians* of the Dnieper, and the Cossacks\r\nof the Don.\r\n\r\n     * The name \"Zaporovians,\" by which they are known in the\r\n     West, is a corruption of the Russian word Zaporozhtsi, which\r\n     means \"Those who live beyond the rapids.\"\r\n\r\nThe Zaporovian Commonwealth has been compared sometimes to ancient\r\nSparta, and sometimes to the mediaeval Military Orders, but it had\r\nin reality quite a different character. In Sparta the nobles kept in\r\nsubjection a large population of slaves, and were themselves constantly\r\nunder the severe discipline of the magistrates. These Cossacks of the\r\nDnieper, on the contrary, lived by fishing, hunting, and marauding,\r\nand knew nothing of discipline, except in time of war. Amongst all\r\nthe inhabitants of the Setch--so the fortified camp was called--there\r\nreigned the most perfect equality. The common saying, \"Bear patiently,\r\nCossack; you will one day be Ataman!\" was often realised; for every year\r\nthe office-bearers laid down the insignia of office in presence of the\r\ngeneral assembly, and after thanking the brotherhood for the honour they\r\nhad enjoyed, retired to their former position of common Cossack. At the\r\nelection which followed this ceremony any member could be chosen chief\r\nof his kuren, or company, and any chief of a kuren could be chosen\r\nAtaman.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of these bold Borderers with the mediaeval Military\r\nOrders is scarcely less forced. They call themselves, indeed, Lytsars--a\r\ncorruption of the Russian word Ritsar, which is in its turn a corruption\r\nof the German Ritter--talked of knightly honour (lytsarskaya tchest\u0027),\r\nand sometimes proclaimed themselves the champions of Greek Orthodoxy\r\nagainst the Roman Catholicism of the Poles and the Mahometanism of the\r\nTartars; but religion occupied in their minds a very secondary place.\r\nTheir great object in life was the acquisition of booty. To attain this\r\nobject they lived in intermittent warfare with the Tartars, lifted their\r\ncattle, pillaged their aouls, swept the Black Sea in flotillas of small\r\nboats, and occasionally sacked important coast towns, such as Varna\r\nand Sinope. When Tartar booty could not be easily obtained, they turned\r\ntheir attention to the Slavonic populations; and when hard pressed by\r\nChristian potentates, they did not hesitate to put themselves under the\r\nprotection of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks of the Don, of the Volga, and of the Ural had a somewhat\r\ndifferent organisation. They had no fortified camp like the Setch, but\r\nlived in villages, and assembled as necessity demanded. As they were\r\ncompletely beyond the sphere of Polish influence, they knew nothing\r\nabout \"knightly honour\" and similar conceptions of Western chivalry;\r\nthey even adopted many Tartar customs, and loved in time of peace to\r\nstrut about in gorgeous Tartar costumes. Besides this, they were\r\nnearly all emigrants from Great Russia, and mostly Old Ritualists or\r\nSectarians, whilst the Zaporovians were Little Russians and Orthodox.\r\n\r\nThese military communities rendered valuable service to Russia. The best\r\nmeans of protecting the southern frontier was to have as allies a large\r\nbody of men leading the same kind of life and capable of carrying on the\r\nsame kind of warfare as the nomadic marauders; and such a body of men\r\nwere the Free Cossacks. The sentiment of self-preservation and the\r\ndesire of booty kept them constantly on the alert. By sending out small\r\nparties in all directions, by \"procuring tongues\"--that is to say, by\r\nkidnapping and torturing straggling Tartars with a view to extracting\r\ninformation from them--and by keeping spies in the enemy\u0027s territory,\r\nthey were generally apprised beforehand of any intended incursion. When\r\ndanger threatened, the ordinary precautions were redoubled. Day and\r\nnight patrols kept watch at the points where the enemy was expected, and\r\nas soon as sure signs of his approach were discovered a pile of tarred\r\nbarrels prepared for the purpose was fired to give the alarm. Rapidly\r\nthe signal was repeated at one point of observation after another, and\r\nby this primitive system of telegraphy in the course of a few hours the\r\nwhole district was up in arms. If the invaders were not too numerous,\r\nthey were at once attacked and driven back. If they could not be\r\nsuccessfully resisted, they were allowed to pass; but a troop of\r\nCossacks was sent to pillage their aouls in their absence, whilst\r\nanother and larger force was collected, in order to intercept them when\r\nthey were returning home laden with booty. Thus many a nameless battle\r\nwas fought on the trackless Steppe, and many brave men fell unhonoured\r\nand unsung:\r\n\r\n\"Illacrymabiles Urgentur ignotique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these valuable services, the Cossack communities were\r\na constant source of diplomatic difficulties and political dangers. As\r\nthey paid very little attention to the orders of the Government, they\r\nsupplied the Sultan with any number of casi belli, and were often ready\r\nto turn their arms against the power to which they professed allegiance.\r\nDuring \"the troublous times,\" for example, when the national existence\r\nwas endangered by civil strife and foreign invasion, they overran the\r\ncountry, robbing, pillaging, and burning as they were wont to do in the\r\nTartar aouls. At a later period the Don Cossacks twice raised formidable\r\ninsurrections--first under Stenka Razin (1670), and secondly under\r\nPugatchef (1773)--and during the war between Peter the Great and Charles\r\nXII. of Sweden the Zaporovians took the side of the Swedish king.\r\n\r\nThe Government naturally strove to put an end to this danger,\r\nand ultimately succeeded. All the Cossacks were deprived of their\r\nindependence, but the fate of the various communities was different.\r\nThose of the Volga were transfered to the Terek, where they had abundant\r\noccupation in guarding the frontier against the incursions of the\r\nEastern Caucasian tribes. The Zaporovians held tenaciously to their\r\n\"Dnieper liberties,\" and resisted all interference, till they were\r\nforcibly disbanded in the time of Catherine II. The majority of them\r\nfled to Turkey, where some of their descendants are still to be found,\r\nand the remainder were settled on the Kuban, where they could lead their\r\nold life by carrying on an irregular warfare with the tribes of the\r\nWestern Caucasus. Since the capture of Shamyl and the pacification\r\nof the Caucasus, this Cossack population of the Kuban and the Terek,\r\nextending in an unbroken line from the Sea of Azof to the Caspian, have\r\nbeen able to turn their attention to peaceful pursuits, and now raise\r\nlarge quantities of wheat for exportation; but they still retain their\r\nmartial bearing, and some of them regret the good old times when a brush\r\nwith the Circassians was an ordinary occurrence and the work of tilling\r\nthe soil was often diversified with a more exciting kind of occupation.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks of the Ural and the Don have been allowed to remain in\r\ntheir old homes, but they have been deprived of their independence\r\nand self-government, and their social organisation has been completely\r\nchanged. The boisterous popular assemblies which formerly decided all\r\npublic affairs have been abolished, and the custom of choosing the\r\nAtaman and other office-bearers by popular election has been replaced\r\nby a system of regular promotion, according to rules elaborated in\r\nSt. Petersburg. The officers and their families now compose a kind of\r\nhereditary aristocracy which has succeeded in appropriating, by means of\r\nImperial grants, a large portion of the land which was formerly common\r\nproperty. As the Empire expanded in Asia the system of protecting the\r\nparties by Cossack colonists was extended eastwards, so now there is a\r\nbelt of Cossack territory stretching almost without interruption from\r\nthe banks of the Don to the coast of the Pacific. It is divided into\r\neleven sections, in each of which is settled a Cossack corps with a\r\nseparate administration.\r\n\r\nWhen universal military service was introduced, in 1873, the Cossacks\r\nwere brought under the new law, but in order to preserve their military\r\ntraditions and habits they were allowed to retain, with certain\r\nmodifications, their old organisation, rights, and privileges. In return\r\nfor a large amount of fertile land and exemption from direct taxation,\r\nthey have to equip themselves at their own expense, and serve for twenty\r\nyears, of which three are spent in preparatory training, twelve in the\r\nactive army, and five in the reserve. This system gives to the army\r\na contingent of about 330,000 men--divided into 890 squadrons and 108\r\ninfantry companies--with 236 guns.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks in active service are to be met with in all parts of\r\nthe Empire, from the Prussian to the Chinese frontier. In the Asiatic\r\nProvinces their services are invaluable. Capable of enduring an\r\nincredible amount of fatigue and all manner of privations, they can live\r\nand thrive in conditions which would soon disable regular troops. The\r\ncapacity of self-adaptation, which is characteristic of the Russian\r\npeople generally, is possessed by them in the highest degree. When\r\nplaced on some distant Asiatic frontier they can at once transform\r\nthemselves into squatters--building their own houses, raising crops of\r\ngrain, and living as colonists without neglecting their military duties.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes heard it asserted by military men that the Cossack\r\norganisation is an antiquated institution, and that the soldiers which\r\nit produces, however useful they may be in Central Asia, would be of\r\nlittle service in regular European warfare. Whether this view, which\r\nreceived some confirmation in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, is\r\ntrue or false I cannot pretend to say, for it is a subject on which\r\na civilian has no right to speak; but I may remark that the Cossacks\r\nthemselves are not by any means of that opinion. They regard themselves\r\nas the most valuable troops which the Tsar possesses, believing\r\nthemselves capable of performing anything within the bounds of human\r\npossibility, and a good deal that lies beyond that limit. More than once\r\nDon Cossacks have assured me that if the Tsar had allowed them to fit\r\nout a flotilla of small boats during the Crimean War they would have\r\ncaptured the British fleet, as their ancestors used to capture Turkish\r\ngalleys on the Black Sea!\r\n\r\nIn old times, throughout the whole territory of the Don Cossacks,\r\nagriculture was prohibited on pain of death. It is generally supposed\r\nthat this measure was adopted with a view to preserve the martial\r\nspirit of the inhabitants, but it may be explained otherwise. The great\r\nmajority of the Cossacks, averse to all regular, laborious occupations,\r\nwished to live by fishing, hunting, cattle-breeding, and marauding,\r\nbut there was always amongst them a considerable number of\r\nimmigrants--runaway serfs from the interior--who had been accustomed to\r\nlive by agriculture. These latter wished to raise crops on the fertile\r\nvirgin soil, and if they had been allowed to do so they would to some\r\nextent have spoiled the pastures. We have here, I believe, the true\r\nreason for the above-mentioned prohibition, and this view is strongly\r\nconfirmed by analogous facts which I have observed in another locality.\r\nIn the Kirghiz territory the poorer inhabitants of the aouls near the\r\nfrontier, having few or no cattle, wish to let part of the common land\r\nto the neighbouring Russian peasantry for agricultural purposes; but\r\nthe richer inhabitants, who possess flocks and herds, strenuously oppose\r\nthis movement, and would doubtless prohibit it under pain of death if\r\nthey had the power, because all agricultural encroachments diminish the\r\npasture-land.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the real reason of the prohibition, practical necessity\r\nproved in the long run too strong for the anti-agriculturists. As the\r\npopulation augmented and the opportunities for marauding decreased, the\r\nmajority had to overcome their repugnance to husbandry; and soon large\r\npatches of ploughed land or waving grain were to be seen in the vicinity\r\nof the stanitsas, as the Cossack villages are termed. At first there was\r\nno attempt to regulate this new use of the ager publicus. Each Cossack\r\nwho wished to raise a crop ploughed and sowed wherever he thought fit,\r\nand retained as long as he chose the land thus appropriated; and when\r\nthe soil began to show signs of exhaustion he abandoned his plot and\r\nploughed elsewhere. But this unregulated use of the Communal property\r\ncould not long continue. As the number of agriculturists increased,\r\nquarrels frequently arose, and sometimes terminated in bloodshed. Still\r\nworse evils appeared when markets were created in the vicinity, and it\r\nbecame possible to sell the grain for exportation. In some stanitsas the\r\nricher families appropriated enormous quantities of the common land\r\nby using several teams of oxen, or by hiring peasants in the nearest\r\nvillages to come and plough for them; and instead of abandoning the land\r\nafter raising two or three crops they retained possession of it, and\r\ncame to regard it as their private property. Thus the whole of the\r\narable land, or at least the best part of it, became actually, if\r\nnot legally, the private property of a few families, whilst the less\r\nenergetic or less fortunate inhabitants of the stanitsa had only parcels\r\nof comparatively barren soil, or had no land whatever, and became mere\r\nagricultural labourers.\r\n\r\nAfter a time this injustice was remedied. The landless members justly\r\ncomplained that they had to bear the same burdens as those who possessed\r\nthe land, and that therefore they ought to enjoy the same privileges.\r\nThe old spirit of equality was still strong amongst them, and they\r\nultimately succeeded in asserting their rights. In accordance with their\r\ndemands the appropriated land was confiscated by the Commune, and the\r\nsystem of periodical redistributions was introduced. By this system each\r\nadult male possesses a share of the land.\r\n\r\nThese facts tend to throw light on some of the dark questions of social\r\ndevelopment in its early stages.\r\n\r\nSo long as a village community leads a purely pastoral life, and\r\npossesses an abundance of land, there is no reason why the individuals\r\nor the families of which it is composed should divide the land into\r\nprivate lots, and there are very potent reasons why they should not\r\nadopt such a course. To give the division of the land any practical\r\nsignificance, it would be necessary to raise fences of some kind, and\r\nthese fences, requiring for their construction a certain amount of\r\nlabour, would prove merely a useless encumbrance, for it is much more\r\nconvenient that all the sheep and cattle should graze together. If there\r\nis a scarcity of pasture, and consequently a conflict of interest among\r\nthe families, the enjoyment of the common land will be regulated not by\r\nraising fences, but by simply limiting the number of sheep and cattle\r\nwhich each family is entitled to put upon the pasturage, as is done in\r\nmany Russian villages at the present day. When any one desires to keep\r\nmore sheep and cattle than the maximum to which he is entitled, he pays\r\nto the others a certain compensation. Thus, we see, in pastoral life\r\nthe dividing of the common land is unnecessary and inexpedient, and\r\nconsequently private property in land is not likely to come into\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of agriculture appears a tendency to divide the\r\nland among the families composing the community, for each family living\r\nby husbandry requires a definite portion of the soil. If the land\r\nsuitable for agricultural purposes be plentiful, each head of a family\r\nmay be allowed to take possession of as much of it as he requires, as\r\nwas formerly done in the Cossack stanitsas; if, on the contrary, the\r\narea of arable land is small, as is the case in some Bashkir aouls,\r\nthere will probably be a regular allotment of it among the families.\r\n\r\nWith the tendency to divide the land into definite portions arises a\r\nconflict between the principle of communal and the principle of private\r\nproperty. Those who obtain definite portions of the soil are in general\r\nlikely to keep them and transmit them to their descendants. In a\r\ncountry, however, like the Steppe--and it is only of such countries\r\nthat I am at present speaking--the nature of the soil and the system of\r\nagriculture militate against this conversion of simple possession into a\r\nright of property. A plot of land is commonly cultivated for only three\r\nor four years in succession. It is then abandoned for at least double\r\nthat period, and the cultivators remove to some other portion of the\r\ncommunal territory. After a time, it is true, they return to the old\r\nportion, which has been in the meantime lying fallow; but as the soil is\r\ntolerably equal in quality, the families or individuals have no reason\r\nto desire the precise plots which they formerly possessed. Under such\r\ncircumstances the principle of private property in the land is not\r\nlikely to strike root; each family insists on possessing a certain\r\nQUANTITY rather than a certain PLOT of land, and contents itself with a\r\nright of usufruct, whilst the right of property remains in the hands of\r\nthe Commune; and it must not be forgotten that the difference between\r\nusufruct and property here is of great practical importance, for so long\r\nas the Commune retains the right of property it may re-allot the land in\r\nany way it thinks fit.\r\n\r\nAs the population increases and land becomes less plentiful, the\r\nprimitive method of agriculture above alluded to gives place to a less\r\nprimitive method, commonly known as \"the three-field system,\" according\r\nto which the cultivators do not migrate periodically from one part of\r\nthe communal territory to another, but till always the same fields,\r\nand are obliged to manure the plots which they occupy. The principle of\r\ncommunal property rarely survives this change, for by long possession\r\nthe families acquire a prescriptive right to the portions which they\r\ncultivate, and those who manure their land well naturally object to\r\nexchange it for land which has been held by indolent, improvident\r\nneighbours. In Russia, however, this change has not destroyed the\r\nprinciple of communal property. Though the three-field system has been\r\nin use for many generations in the central provinces, the communal\r\nprinciple, with its periodical re-allotment of the land, still remains\r\nintact.\r\n\r\nFor the student of sociology the past history and actual condition of\r\nthe Don Cossacks present many other features equally interesting and\r\ninstructive. He may there see, for instance, how an aristocracy can be\r\ncreated by military promotion, and how serfage may originate and become\r\na recognised institution without any legislative enactment. If he takes\r\nan interest in peculiar manifestations of religious thought and feeling,\r\nhe will find a rich field of investigation in the countless religious\r\nsects; and if he is a collector of quaint old customs, he will not lack\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nOne curious custom, which has very recently died out, I may here\r\nmention by way of illustration. As the Cossacks knew very little about\r\nland-surveying, and still less about land-registration, the precise\r\nboundary between two contiguous yurts--as the communal land of a\r\nstanitsa was called--was often a matter of uncertainty and a fruitful\r\nsource of disputes. When the boundary was once determined, the following\r\nmethod of registering it was employed. All the boys of the two stanitsas\r\nwere collected and driven in a body like sheep to the intervening\r\nfrontier. The whole population then walked along the frontier that had\r\nbeen agreed upon, and at each landmark a number of boys were soundly\r\nwhipped and allowed to run home! This was done in the hope that the\r\nvictims would remember, as long as they lived, the spot where they had\r\nreceived their unmerited castigation.* The device, I have been assured,\r\nwas generally very effective, but it was not always quite successful.\r\nWhether from the castigation not being sufficiently severe, or from\r\nsome other defect in the method, it sometimes happened that disputes\r\nafterwards arose, and the whipped boys, now grown up to manhood, gave\r\nconflicting testimony. When such a case occurred the following expedient\r\nwas adopted. One of the oldest inhabitants was chosen as arbiter, and\r\nmade to swear on the Scriptures that he would act honestly to the best\r\nof his knowledge; then taking an Icon in his hand, he walked along what\r\nhe believed to be the old frontier. Whether he made mistakes or not, his\r\ndecision was accepted by both parties and regarded as final. This custom\r\nexisted in some stanitsas down to the year 1850, when the boundaries\r\nwere clearly determined by Government officials.\r\n\r\n     * A custom of this kind, I am told, existed not very long\r\n     ago in England and is still spoken of as \"the beating of the\r\n     bounds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nFOREIGN COLONISTS ON THE STEPPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Steppe--Variety of Races, Languages, and Religions--The German\r\nColonists--In What Sense the Russians are an Imitative\r\nPeople--The Mennonites--Climate and Arboriculture--Bulgarian\r\nColonists--Tartar-Speaking Greeks--Jewish\r\nAgriculturists--Russification--A Circassian Scotchman--Numerical\r\nStrength of the Foreign Element.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn European Russia the struggle between agriculture and nomadic\r\nbarbarism is now a thing of the past, and the fertile Steppe, which was\r\nfor centuries a battle-ground of the Aryan and Turanian races, has been\r\nincorporated into the dominions of the Tsar. The nomadic tribes have\r\nbeen partly driven out and partly pacified and parked in \"reserves,\"\r\nand the territory which they so long and so stubbornly defended is now\r\nstudded with peaceful villages and tilled by laborious agriculturists.\r\n\r\nIn traversing this region the ordinary tourist will find little to\r\ninterest him. He will see nothing which he can possibly dignify by the\r\nname of scenery, and he may journey on for many days without having\r\nany occasion to make an entry in his note-book. If he should happen,\r\nhowever, to be an ethnologist and linguist, he may find occupation, for\r\nhe will here meet with fragments of many different races and a variety\r\nof foreign tongues.\r\n\r\nThis ethnological variety is the result of a policy inaugurated by\r\nCatherine II. So long as the southern frontier was pushed forward\r\nslowly, the acquired territory was regularly filled up by Russian\r\npeasants from the central provinces who were anxious to obtain more land\r\nand more liberty than they enjoyed in their native villages; but during\r\n\"the glorious age of Catherine\" the frontier was pushed forward so\r\nrapidly that the old method of spontaneous emigration no longer sufficed\r\nto people the annexed territory. The Empress had recourse, therefore,\r\nto organised emigration from foreign countries. Her diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives in Western Europe tried to induce artisans and peasants\r\nto emigrate to Russia, and special agents were sent to various countries\r\nto supplement the efforts of the diplomatists. Thousands accepted the\r\ninvitation, and were for the most part settled on the land which had\r\nbeen recently the pasture-ground of the nomadic hordes.\r\n\r\nThis policy was adopted by succeeding sovereigns, and the consequence of\r\nit has been that Southern Russia now contains a variety of races such as\r\nis to be found, perhaps, nowhere else in Europe. The official statistics\r\nof New Russia alone--that is to say, the provinces of Ekaterinoslaf,\r\nTauride, Kherson, and Bessarabia--enumerate the following nationalities:\r\nGreat Russians, Little Russians, Poles, Servians, Montenegrins,\r\nBulgarians, Moldavians, Germans, English, Swedes, Swiss, French,\r\nItalians, Greeks, Armenians, Tartars, Mordwa, Jews, and Gypsies. The\r\nreligions are almost equally numerous. The statistics speak of Greek\r\nOrthodox, Roman Catholics, Gregorians, Lutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans,\r\nMennonites, Separatists, Pietists, Karaim Jews, Talmudists, Mahometans,\r\nand numerous Russian sects, such as the Molokanye and the Skoptsi or\r\nEunuchs. America herself could scarcely show a more motley list in her\r\nstatistics of population.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to state that the above list, though literally correct,\r\ndoes not give a true idea of the actual population. The great body\r\nof the inhabitants are Russian and Orthodox, whilst several of the\r\nnationalities named are represented by a small number of souls--some of\r\nthem, such as the French, being found exclusively in the towns. Still,\r\nthe variety even in the rural population is very great. Once, in\r\nthe space of three days, and using only the most primitive means of\r\nconveyance, I visited colonies of Greeks, Germans, Servians, Bulgarians,\r\nMontenegrins, and Jews.\r\n\r\nOf all the foreign colonists the Germans are by far the most numerous.\r\nThe object of the Government in inviting them to settle in the country\r\nwas that they should till the unoccupied land and thereby increase\r\nthe national wealth, and that they should at the same time exercise a\r\ncivilising influence on the Russian peasantry in their vicinity. In\r\nthis latter respect they have totally failed to fulfil their mission.\r\nA Russian village, situated in the midst of German colonies, shows\r\ngenerally, so far as I could observe, no signs of German influence. Each\r\nnationality lives more majorum, and holds as little communication as\r\npossible with the other. The muzhik observes carefully--for he is very\r\ncurious--the mode of life of his more advanced neighbours, but he never\r\nthinks of adopting it. He looks upon Germans almost as beings of a\r\ndifferent world--as a wonderfully cunning and ingenious people, who\r\nhave been endowed by Providence with peculiar qualities not possessed by\r\nordinary Orthodox humanity. To him it seems in the nature of things that\r\nGermans should live in large, clean, well-built houses, in the same way\r\nas it is in the nature of things that birds should build nests; and\r\nas it has probably never occurred to a human being to build a nest for\r\nhimself and his family, so it never occurs to a Russian peasant to\r\nbuild a house on the German model. Germans are Germans, and Russians are\r\nRussians--and there is nothing more to be said on the subject.\r\n\r\nThis stubbornly conservative spirit of the peasantry who live in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Germans seems to give the lie direct to the\r\noft-repeated and universally believed assertion that Russians are an\r\nimitative people strongly disposed to adopt the manners and customs of\r\nany foreigners with whom they may come in contact. The Russian, it is\r\nsaid, changes his nationality as easily as he changes his coat, and\r\nderives great satisfaction from wearing some nationality that does not\r\nbelong to him; but here we have an important fact which appears to prove\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that in this matter we must distinguish between the\r\nNoblesse and the peasantry. The nobles are singularly prone to adopt\r\nforeign manners, customs, and institutions; the peasants, on the\r\ncontrary, are as a rule decidedly conservative. It must not, however, be\r\nsupposed that this proceeds from a difference of race; the difference is\r\nto be explained by the past history of the two classes. Like all other\r\npeoples, the Russians are strongly conservative so long as they remain\r\nin what may be termed their primitive moral habitat--that is to say, so\r\nlong as external circumstances do not force them out of their accustomed\r\ntraditional groove. The Noblesse were long ago violently forced out of\r\ntheir old groove by the reforming Tsars, and since that time they have\r\nbeen so constantly driven hither and thither by foreign influences that\r\nthey have never been able to form a new one. Thus they easily enter upon\r\nany new path which seems to them profitable or attractive. The great\r\nmass of the people, on the contrary, too heavy to be thus lifted out of\r\nthe guiding influence of custom and tradition, are still animated with a\r\nstrongly conservative spirit.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this view I may mention two facts which have often\r\nattracted my attention. The first is that the Molokanye--a primitive\r\nEvangelical sect of which I shall speak at length in the next\r\nchapter--succumb gradually to German influence; by becoming heretics in\r\nreligion they free themselves from one of the strongest bonds attaching\r\nthem to the past, and soon become heretics in things secular. The second\r\nfact is that even the Orthodox peasant, when placed by circumstances in\r\nsome new sphere of activity, readily adopts whatever seems profitable.\r\nTake, for example, the peasants who abandon agriculture and embark in\r\nindustrial enterprises; finding themselves, as it were, in a new world,\r\nin which their old traditional notions are totally inapplicable, they\r\nhave no hesitation in adopting foreign ideas and foreign inventions. And\r\nwhen once they have chosen this new path, they are much more \"go-ahead\"\r\nthan the Germans. Freed alike from the trammels of hereditary\r\nconceptions and from the prudence which experience generates, they often\r\ngive a loose rein to their impulsive character, and enter freely on the\r\nwildest speculations.\r\n\r\nThe marked contrast presented by a German colony and a Russian village\r\nin close proximity with each other is often used to illustrate the\r\nsuperiority of the Teutonic over the Slavonic race, and in order to make\r\nthe contrast more striking, the Mennonite colonies are generally taken\r\nas the representatives of the Germans. Without entering here on the\r\ngeneral question, I must say that this method of argumentation is\r\nscarcely fair. The Mennonites, who formerly lived in the neighbourhood\r\nof Danzig and emigrated from Prussia in order to escape the military\r\nconscription, brought with them to their new home a large store of\r\nuseful technical knowledge and a considerable amount of capital, and\r\nthey received a quantity of land very much greater than the Russian\r\npeasants possess. Besides this, they enjoyed until very recently several\r\nvaluable privileges. They were entirely exempted from military service\r\nand almost entirely exempted from taxation. Altogether their lines fell\r\nin very pleasant places. In material and moral well-being they stand as\r\nfar above the majority of the ordinary German colonists as these latter\r\ndo above their Russian neighbours. Even in the richest districts of\r\nGermany their prosperity would attract attention. To compare these\r\nrich, privileged, well-educated farmers with the poor, heavily taxed,\r\nuneducated peasantry, and to draw from the comparison conclusions\r\nconcerning the capabilities of the two races, is a proceeding so absurd\r\nthat it requires no further comment.\r\n\r\nTo the wearied traveller who has been living for some time in Russian\r\nvillages, one of these Mennonite colonies seems an earthly paradise. In\r\na little hollow, perhaps by the side of a watercourse, he suddenly comes\r\non a long row of high-roofed houses half concealed in trees. The\r\ntrees may be found on closer inspection to be little better than mere\r\nsaplings; but after a long journey on the bare Steppe, where there is\r\nneither tree nor bush of any kind, the foliage, scant as it is, appears\r\nsingularly inviting. The houses are large, well arranged, and kept in\r\nsuch thoroughly good repair that they always appear to be newly built.\r\nThe rooms are plainly furnished, without any pretensions to elegance,\r\nbut scrupulously clean. Adjoining the house are the stable and byre,\r\nwhich would not disgrace a model farm in Germany or England. In front\r\nis a spacious courtyard, which has the appearance of being swept several\r\ntimes a day, and behind there is a garden well stocked with vegetables.\r\nFruit trees and flowers are not very plentiful, for the climate is not\r\nfavourable to them.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are honest, frugal folk, somewhat sluggish of intellect\r\nand indifferent to things lying beyond the narrow limits of their own\r\nlittle world, but shrewd enough in all matters which they deem worthy of\r\ntheir attention. If you arrive amongst them as a stranger you may be\r\na little chilled by the welcome you receive, for they are exclusive,\r\nreserved, and distrustful, and do not much like to associate with those\r\nwho do not belong to their own sect; but if you can converse with\r\nthem in their mother tongue and talk about religious matters in\r\nan evangelical tone, you may easily overcome their stiffness and\r\nexclusiveness. Altogether such a village cannot be recommended for a\r\nlengthened sojourn, for the severe order and symmetry which everywhere\r\nprevail would soon prove irksome to any one having no Dutch blood in\r\nhis veins;* but as a temporary resting-place during a pilgrimage on\r\nthe Steppe, when the pilgrim is longing for a little cleanliness and\r\ncomfort, it is very agreeable.\r\n\r\n     * The Mennonites were originally Dutchmen.  Persecuted for\r\n     their religious views in the sixteenth century, a large\r\n     number of them accepted an invitation to settle in West\r\n     Prussia, where they helped to drain the great marshes\r\n     between Danzig, Elbing, and Marienburg. Here in the course\r\n     of time they forgot their native language. Their emigration\r\n     to Russia began in 1789.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these Mennonites and some other German colonies have\r\nsucceeded in rearing a few sickly trees has suggested to some fertile\r\nminds the idea that the prevailing dryness of the climate, which is\r\nthe chief difficulty with which the agriculturist of that region has\r\nto contend, might be to some extent counteracted by arboriculture on a\r\nlarge scale. This scheme, though it has been seriously entertained by\r\none of his Majesty\u0027s ministers, must seem hardly practicable to any\r\none who knows how much labour and money the colonists have expended in\r\ncreating that agreeable shade which they love to enjoy in their leisure\r\nhours. If climate is affected at all by the existence or non-existence\r\nof forests--a point on which scientific men do not seem to be entirely\r\nagreed--any palpable increase of the rainfall can be produced only by\r\nforests of enormous extent, and it is hardly conceivable that these\r\ncould be artificially produced in Southern Russia. It is quite possible,\r\nhowever, that local ameliorations may be effected. During a visit to\r\nthe province of Voronezh in 1903 I found that comparatively small\r\nplantations diminished the effects of drought in their immediate\r\nvicinity by retaining the moisture for a time in the soil and the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter the Mennonites and other Germans, the Bulgarian colonists deserve\r\na passing notice. They settled in this region much more recently, on the\r\nland that was left vacant by the exodus of the Nogai Tartars after the\r\nCrimean War. If I may judge of their condition by a mere flying visit,\r\nI should say that in agriculture and domestic civilisation they are\r\nnot very far behind the majority of German colonists. Their houses\r\nare indeed small--so small that one of them might almost be put into a\r\nsingle room of a Mennonite\u0027s house; but there is an air of cleanliness\r\nand comfort about them that would do credit to a German housewife.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, these Bulgarians were, I could easily perceive, by\r\nno means delighted with their new home. The cause of their discontent,\r\nso far as I could gather from the few laconic remarks which I\r\nextracted from them, seemed to be this: Trusting to the highly coloured\r\ndescriptions furnished by the emigration agents who had induced them to\r\nchange the rule of the Sultan for the authority of the Tsar, they\r\ncame to Russia with the expectation of finding a fertile and beautiful\r\nPromised Land. Instead of a land flowing with milk and honey, they\r\nreceived a tract of bare Steppe on which even water could be obtained\r\nonly with great difficulty--with no shade to protect them from the heat\r\nof summer and nothing to shelter them from the keen northern blasts that\r\noften sweep over those open plains. As no adequate arrangements had been\r\nmade for their reception, they were quartered during the first winter\r\non the German colonists, who, being quite innocent of any Slavophil\r\nsympathies, were probably not very hospitable to their uninvited\r\nguests. To complete their disappointment, they found that they could not\r\ncultivate the vine, and that their mild, fragrant tobacco, which is for\r\nthem a necessary of life, could be obtained only at a very high price.\r\nSo disconsolate were they under this cruel disenchantment that, at the\r\ntime of my visit, they talked of returning to their old homes in Turkey.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the less prosperous colonists, I may mention the\r\nTartar-speaking Greeks in the neighbourhood of Mariupol, on the northern\r\nshore of the Sea of Azof. Their ancestors lived in the Crimea, under\r\nthe rule of the Tartar Khans, and emigrated to Russia in the time of\r\nCatherine II., before Crim Tartary was annexed to the Russian Empire.\r\nThey have almost entirely forgotten their old language, but have\r\npreserved their old faith. In adopting the Tartar language they have\r\nadopted something of Tartar indolence and apathy, and the natural\r\nconsequence is that they are poor and ignorant.\r\n\r\nBut of all the colonists of this region the least prosperous are the\r\nJews. The Chosen People are certainly a most intelligent, industrious,\r\nfrugal race, and in all matters of buying, selling, and bartering they\r\nare unrivalled among the nations of the earth, but they have been too\r\nlong accustomed to town life to be good tillers of the soil. These\r\nJewish colonies were founded as an experiment to see whether the\r\nIsraelite could be weaned from his traditionary pursuits and transferred\r\nto what some economists call the productive section of society. The\r\nexperiment has failed, and the cause of the failure is not difficult to\r\nfind. One has merely to look at these men of gaunt visage and shambling\r\ngait, with their loop-holed slippers, and black, threadbare coats\r\nreaching down to their ankles, to understand that they are not in their\r\nproper sphere. Their houses are in a most dilapidated condition, and\r\ntheir villages remind one of the abomination of desolation spoken of by\r\nDaniel the Prophet. A great part of their land is left uncultivated or\r\nlet to colonists of a different race. What little revenue they have is\r\nderived chiefly from trade of a more or less clandestine nature.*\r\n\r\n     * Mr. Arnold White, who subsequently visited some of these\r\n     Jewish Colonies in connection with Baron Hirsch\u0027s\r\n     colonisation scheme, assured me that he found them in a much\r\n     more prosperous condition.\r\n\r\nAs Scandinavia was formerly called officina gentium--a workshop in which\r\nnew nations were made--so we may regard Southern Russia as a workshop\r\nin which fragments of old nations are being melted down to form a new,\r\ncomposite whole. It must be confessed, however, that the melting process\r\nhas as yet scarcely begun.\r\n\r\nNational peculiarities are not obliterated so rapidly in Russia as in\r\nAmerica or in British colonies. Among the German colonists in Russia the\r\nprocess of assimilation is hardly perceptible. Though their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers may have been born in the new country, they would consider\r\nit an insult to be called Russians. They look down upon the Russian\r\npeasantry as poor, ignorant, lazy, and dishonest, fear the officials\r\non account of their tyranny and extortion, preserve jealously their\r\nown language and customs, rarely speak Russian well--sometimes not at\r\nall--and never intermarry with those from whom they are separated by\r\nnationality and religion. The Russian influence acts, however,\r\nmore rapidly on the Slavonic colonists--Servians, Bulgarians,\r\nMontenegrins--who profess the Greek Orthodox faith, learn more easily\r\nthe Russian language, which is closely allied to their own, have no\r\nconsciousness of belonging to a Culturvolk, and in general possess a\r\nnature much more pliable than the Teutonic.\r\n\r\nThe Government has recently attempted to accelerate the fusing process\r\nby retracting the privileges granted to the colonists and abolishing\r\nthe peculiar administration under which they were placed. These\r\nmeasures--especially the universal military service--may eventually\r\ndiminish the extreme exclusiveness of the Germans; the youths, whilst\r\nserving in the army, will at least learn the Russian language, and may\r\npossibly imbibe something of the Russian spirit. But for the present\r\nthis new policy has aroused a strong feeling of hostility and greatly\r\nintensified the spirit of exclusiveness. In the German colonies I have\r\noften overheard complaints about Russian tyranny and uncomplimentary\r\nremarks about the Russian national character.\r\n\r\nThe Mennonites consider themselves specially aggrieved by the so-called\r\nreforms. They came to Russia in order to escape military service and\r\nwith the distinct understanding that they should be exempted from it,\r\nand now they are forced to act contrary to the religious tenets of their\r\nsect. This is the ground of complaint which they put forward in the\r\npetitions addressed to the Government, but they have at the same time\r\nanother, and perhaps more important, objection to the proposed changes.\r\nThey feel, as several of them admitted to me, that if the barrier which\r\nseparates them from the rest of the population were in any way broken\r\ndown, they could no longer preserve that stern Puritanical discipline\r\nwhich at present constitutes their force. Hence, though the Government\r\nwas disposed to make important concessions, hundreds of families sold\r\ntheir property and emigrated to America. The movement, however, did\r\nnot become general. At present the Russian Mennonites number, male and\r\nfemale, about 50,000, divided into 160 colonies and possessing over\r\n800,000 acres of land.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that under the new system of administration the\r\ncolonists who profess in common with the Russians the Greek Orthodox\r\nfaith may be rapidly Russianised; but I am convinced that the\r\nothers will long resist assimilation. Greek orthodoxy and Protestant\r\nsectarianism are so radically different in spirit that their respective\r\nvotaries are not likely to intermarry; and without intermarriage it is\r\nimpossible that the two nationalities should blend.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the ethnological curiosities which the traveller may\r\nstumble upon unawares in this curious region, I may mention a strange\r\nacquaintance I made when travelling on the great plain which stretches\r\nfrom the Sea of Azof to the Caspian. One day I accidentally noticed on\r\nmy travelling-map the name \"Shotlandskaya Koldniya\" (Scottish Colony)\r\nnear the celebrated baths of Piatigorsk. I was at that moment in\r\nStavropol, a town about eighty miles to the north, and could not\r\ngain any satisfactory information as to what this colony was. Some\r\nwell-informed people assured me that it really was what its name\r\nimplied, whilst others asserted as confidently that it was simply a\r\nsmall German settlement. To decide the matter I determined to visit\r\nthe place myself, though it did not lie near my intended route, and I\r\naccordingly found myself one morning in the village in question. The\r\nfirst inhabitants whom I encountered were unmistakably German, and\r\nthey professed to know nothing about the existence of Scotsmen in\r\nthe locality either at the present or in former times. This was\r\ndisappointing, and I was about to turn away and drive off, when a young\r\nman, who proved to be the schoolmaster, came up, and on hearing what I\r\ndesired, advised me to consult an old Circassian who lived at the end\r\nof the village and was well acquainted with local antiquities. On\r\nproceeding to the house indicated, I found a venerable old man, with\r\nfine, regular features of the Circassian type, coal-black sparkling\r\neyes, and a long grey beard that would have done honour to a patriarch.\r\nTo him I explained briefly, in Russian, the object of my visit, and\r\nasked whether he knew of any Scotsmen in the district.\r\n\r\n\"And why do you wish to know?\" he replied, in the same language, fixing\r\nme with his keen, sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Because I am myself a Scotsman, and hoped to find fellow-countrymen\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nLet the reader imagine my astonishment when, in reply to this, he\r\nanswered, in genuine broad Scotch, \"Od, man, I\u0027m a Scotsman tae! My name\r\nis John Abercrombie. Did ye never hear tell o\u0027 John Abercrombie, the\r\nfamous Edinburgh doctor?\"\r\n\r\nI was fairly puzzled by this extraordinary declaration. Dr.\r\nAbercrombie\u0027s name was familiar to me as that of a medical practitioner\r\nand writer on psychology, but I knew that he was long since dead. When\r\nI had recovered a little from my surprise, I ventured to remark to the\r\nenigmatical personage before me that, though his tongue was certainly\r\nScotch, his face was as certainly Circassian.\r\n\r\n\"Weel, weel,\" he replied, evidently enjoying my look of mystification,\r\n\"you\u0027re no\u0027 far wrang. I\u0027m a Circassian Scotsman!\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary admission did not diminish my perplexity, so I\r\nbegged my new acquaintance to be a little more explicit, and he at once\r\ncomplied with my request. His long story may be told in a few words:\r\n\r\nIn the first years of the present century a band of Scotch missionaries\r\ncame to Russia for the purpose of converting the Circassian tribes, and\r\nreceived from the Emperor Alexander I. a large grant of land in this\r\nplace, which was then on the frontier of the Empire. Here they founded\r\na mission, and began the work; but they soon discovered that the\r\nsurrounding population were not idolaters, but Mussulmans, and\r\nconsequently impervious to Christianity. In this difficulty they fell\r\non the happy idea of buying Circassian children from their parents and\r\nbringing them up as Christians. One of these children, purchased about\r\nthe year 1806, was a little boy called Teoona. As he had been purchased\r\nwith money subscribed by Dr. Abercrombie, he had received in baptism\r\nthat gentleman\u0027s name, and he considered himself the foster-son of his\r\nbenefactor. Here was the explanation of the mystery.\r\n\r\nTeoona, alias Mr. Abercrombie, was a man of more than average\r\nintelligence. Besides his native tongue, he spoke English, German,\r\nand Russian perfectly; and he assured me that he knew several other\r\nlanguages equally well. His life had been devoted to missionary work,\r\nand especially to translating and printing the Scriptures. He had\r\nlaboured first in Astrakhan, then for four years and a half in\r\nPersia--in the service of the Bale mission--and afterwards for six years\r\nin Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish mission was suppressed by the Emperor Nicholas about the\r\nyear 1835, and all the missionaries except two returned home. The son of\r\none of these two (Galloway) was the only genuine Scotsman remaining at\r\nthe time of my visit. Of the \"Circassian Scotsmen\" there were several,\r\nmost of whom had married Germans. The other inhabitants were German\r\ncolonists from the province of Saratof, and German was the language\r\ncommonly spoken in the village.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing so much about foreign colonists, Tartar invaders,\r\nand Finnish aborigines, the reader may naturally desire to know the\r\nnumerical strength of this foreign element. Unfortunately we have no\r\naccurate data on this subject, but from a careful examination of the\r\navailable statistics I am inclined to conclude that it constitutes\r\nabout one-sixth of the population of European Russia, including Poland,\r\nFinland, and the Caucasus, and nearly a third of the population of the\r\nEmpire as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nAMONG THE HERETICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Molokanye--My Method of Investigation--Alexandrof-Hai--An Unexpected\r\nTheological Discussion--Doctrines and Ecclesiastical Organisation of\r\nthe Molokanye--Moral Supervision and Mutual Assistance--History of the\r\nSect--A False Prophet--Utilitarian Christianity--Classification of\r\nthe Fantastic Sects--The \"Khlysti\"--Policy of the Government towards\r\nSectarianism--Two Kinds of Heresy--Probable Future of the Heretical\r\nSects--Political Disaffection.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst travelling on the Steppe I heard a great deal about a peculiar\r\nreligious sect called the Molokanye, and I felt interested in them\r\nbecause their religious belief, whatever it was, seemed to have a\r\nbeneficial influence on their material welfare. Of the same race and\r\nplaced in the same conditions as the Orthodox peasantry around them,\r\nthey were undoubtedly better housed, better clad, more punctual in\r\nthe payment of their taxes, and, in a word, more prosperous. All my\r\ninformants agreed in describing them as quiet, decent, sober people;\r\nbut regarding their religious doctrines the evidence was vague and\r\ncontradictory. Some described them as Protestants or Lutherans, whilst\r\nothers believed them to be the last remnants of a curious heretical sect\r\nwhich existed in the early Christian Church.\r\n\r\nDesirous of obtaining clear notions on the subject, I determined to\r\ninvestigate the matter for myself. At first I found this to be no easy\r\ntask. In the villages through which I passed I found numerous members of\r\nthe sect, but they all showed a decided repugnance to speak about their\r\nreligious beliefs. Long accustomed to extortion and persecution at the\r\nhands of the Administration, and suspecting me to be a secret agent of\r\nthe Government, they carefully avoided speaking on any subject beyond\r\nthe state of the weather and the prospects of the harvest, and replied\r\nto my questions on other topics as if they had been standing before a\r\nGrand Inquisitor.\r\n\r\nA few unsuccessful attempts convinced me that it would be impossible\r\nto extract from them their religious beliefs by direct questioning. I\r\nadopted, therefore, a different system of tactics. From meagre replies\r\nalready received I had discovered that their doctrine had at least a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to Presbyterianism, and from former experience\r\nI was aware that the curiosity of intelligent Russian peasants is easily\r\nexcited by descriptions of foreign countries. On these two facts I\r\nbased my plan of campaign. When I found a Molokan, or some one whom I\r\nsuspected to be such, I talked for some time about the weather and the\r\ncrops, as if I had no ulterior object in view. Having fully discussed\r\nthis matter, I led the conversation gradually from the weather and crops\r\nin Russia to the weather and crops in Scotland, and then passed slowly\r\nfrom Scotch agriculture to the Scotch Presbyterian Church. On nearly\r\nevery occasion this policy succeeded. When the peasant heard that\r\nthere was a country where the people interpreted the Scriptures for\r\nthemselves, had no bishops, and considered the veneration of Icons as\r\nidolatry, he invariably listened with profound attention; and when he\r\nlearned further that in that wonderful country the parishes annually\r\nsent deputies to an assembly in which all matters pertaining to the\r\nChurch were freely and publicly discussed, he almost always gave free\r\nexpression to his astonishment, and I had to answer a whole volley of\r\nquestions. \"Where is that country?\" \"Is it to the east, or the west?\"\r\n\"Is it very far away?\" \"If our Presbyter could only hear all that!\"\r\n\r\nThis last expression was precisely what I wanted, because it gave me\r\nan opportunity of making the acquaintance of the Presbyter, or pastor,\r\nwithout seeming to desire it; and I knew that a conversation with that\r\npersonage, who is always an uneducated peasant like the others, but\r\nis generally more intelligent and better acquainted with religious\r\ndoctrine, would certainly be of use to me. On more than one occasion I\r\nspent a great part of the night with a Presbyter, and thereby learned\r\nmuch concerning the religious beliefs and practices of the sect. After\r\nthese interviews I was sure to be treated with confidence and respect by\r\nall the Molokanye in the village, and recommended to the brethren of\r\nthe faith in the neighbouring villages through which I intended to pass.\r\nSeveral of the more intelligent peasants with whom I spoke advised me\r\nstrongly to visit Alexandrof-Hai, a village situated on the borders of\r\nthe Kirghiz Steppe. \"We are dark [i.e., ignorant] people here,\" they\r\nwere wont to say, \"and do not know anything, but in Alexandrof-Hai you\r\nwill find those who know the faith, and they will discuss with you.\"\r\nThis prediction was fulfilled in a somewhat unexpected way.\r\n\r\nWhen returning some weeks later from a visit to the Kirghiz of the Inner\r\nHorde, I arrived one evening at this centre of the Molokan faith,\r\nand was hospitably received by one of the brotherhood. In conversing\r\ncasually with my host on religious subjects I expressed to him a desire\r\nto find some one well read in Holy Writ and well grounded in the faith,\r\nand he promised to do what he could for me in this respect. Next morning\r\nhe kept his promise with a vengeance. Immediately after the tea-urn had\r\nbeen removed the door of the room was opened and twelve peasants were\r\nushered in! After the customary salutations with these unexpected\r\nvisitors, my host informed me to my astonishment that his friends\r\nhad come to have a talk with me about the faith; and without further\r\nceremony he placed before me a folio Bible in the old Slavonic tongue,\r\nin order that I might read passages in support of my arguments. As I was\r\nnot at all prepared to open a formal theological discussion, I felt not\r\na little embarrassed, and I could see that my travelling companions,\r\ntwo Russian friends who cared for none of these things, were thoroughly\r\nenjoying my discomfiture. There was, however, no possibility of drawing\r\nback. I had asked for an opportunity of having a talk with some of the\r\nbrethren, and now I had got it in a way that I certainly did not expect.\r\nMy friends withdrew--\"leaving me to my fate,\" as they whispered to\r\nme--and the \"talk\" began.\r\n\r\nMy fate was by no means so terrible as had been anticipated, but at\r\nfirst the situation was a little awkward. Neither party had any clear\r\nideas as to what the other desired, and my visitors expected that I\r\nwas to begin the proceedings. This expectation was quite natural and\r\njustifiable, for I had inadvertently invited them to meet me, but I\r\ncould not make a speech to them, for the best of all reasons--that I\r\ndid not know what to say. If I told them my real aims, their suspicions\r\nwould probably be aroused. My usual stratagem of the weather and the\r\ncrops was wholly inapplicable. For a moment I thought of proposing that\r\na psalm should be sung as a means of breaking the ice, but I felt that\r\nthis would give to the meeting a solemnity which I wished to avoid. On\r\nthe whole it seemed best to begin at once a formal discussion. I told\r\nthem, therefore, that I had spoken with many of their brethren in\r\nvarious villages, and that I had found what I considered grave errors\r\nof doctrine. I could not, for instance, agree with them in their belief\r\nthat it was unlawful to eat pork. This was perhaps an abrupt way\r\nof entering on the subject, but it furnished at least a locus\r\nstandi--something to talk about--and an animated discussion immediately\r\nensued. My opponents first endeavoured to prove their thesis from the\r\nNew Testament, and when this argument broke down they had recourse\r\nto the Pentateuch. From a particular article of the ceremonial law we\r\npassed to the broader question as to how far the ceremonial law is still\r\nbinding, and from this to other points equally important.\r\n\r\nIf the logic of the peasants was not always unimpeachable, their\r\nknowledge of the Scriptures left nothing to be desired. In support\r\nof their views they quoted long passages from memory, and whenever I\r\nindicated vaguely any text which I needed, they at once supplied it\r\nverbatim, so that the big folio Bible served merely as an ornament.\r\nThree or four of them seemed to know the whole of the New Testament by\r\nheart. The course of our informal debate need not here be described;\r\nsuffice it to say that, after four hours of uninterrupted conversation,\r\nwe agreed to differ on questions of detail, and parted from each other\r\nwithout a trace of that ill-feeling which religious discussion commonly\r\nengenders. Never have I met men more honest and courteous in debate,\r\nmore earnest in the search after truth, more careless of dialectical\r\ntriumphs, than these simple, uneducated muzhiks. If at one or two points\r\nin the discussion a little undue warmth was displayed, I must do my\r\nopponents the justice to say that they were not the offending party.\r\n\r\nThis long discussion, as well as numerous discussions which I had\r\nhad before and since have had with Molokanye in various parts of the\r\ncountry, confirmed my first impression that their doctrines have a\r\nstrong resemblance to Presbyterianism. There is, however, an important\r\ndifference. Presbyterianism has an ecclesiastical organisation and a\r\nwritten creed, and its doctrines have long since become clearly defined\r\nby means of public discussion, polemical literature, and general\r\nassemblies. The Molokanye, on the contrary, have had no means of\r\ndeveloping their fundamental principles and forming their vague\r\nreligious beliefs into a clearly defined logical system. Their theology\r\nis therefore still in a half-fluid state, so that it is impossible to\r\npredict what form it will ultimately assume. \"We have not yet thought\r\nabout that,\" I have frequently been told when I inquired about some\r\nabstruse doctrine; \"we must talk about it at the meeting next Sunday.\r\nWhat is your opinion?\" Besides this, their fundamental principles allow\r\ngreat latitude for individual and local differences of opinion. They\r\nhold that Holy Writ is the only rule of faith and conduct, but that it\r\nmust be taken in the spiritual, and not in the literal, sense. As there\r\nis no terrestrial authority to which doubtful points can be referred,\r\neach individual is free to adopt the interpretation which commends\r\nitself to his own judgment. This will no doubt ultimately lead to a\r\nvariety of sects, and already there is a considerable diversity of\r\nopinion between different communities; but this diversity has not yet\r\nbeen recognised, and I may say that I nowhere found that fanatically\r\ndogmatic, quibbling spirit which is usually the soul of sectarianism.\r\n\r\nFor their ecclesiastical organisation the Molokanye take as their\r\nmodel the early Apostolic Church, as depicted in the New Testament, and\r\nuncompromisingly reject all later authorities. In accordance with this\r\nmodel they have no hierarchy and no paid clergy, but choose from among\r\nthemselves a Presbyter and two assistants--men well known among\r\nthe brethren for their exemplary life and their knowledge of the\r\nScriptures--whose duty it is to watch over the religious and moral\r\nwelfare of the flock. On Sundays they hold meetings in private\r\nhouses--they are not allowed to build churches--and spend two or three\r\nhours in psalm singing, prayer, reading the Scriptures, and friendly\r\nconversation on religious subjects. If any one has a doctrinal\r\ndifficulty which he desires to have cleared up, he states it to the\r\ncongregation, and some of the others give their opinions, with the texts\r\non which the opinions are founded. If the question seems clearly solved\r\nby the texts, it is decided; if not, it is left open.\r\n\r\nAs in many young sects, there exists among the Molokanye a system of\r\nsevere moral supervision. If a member has been guilty of drunkenness or\r\nany act unbecoming a Christian, he is first admonished by the Presbyter\r\nin private or before the congregation; and if this does not produce the\r\ndesired effect, he is excluded for a longer or shorter period from the\r\nmeetings and from all intercourse with the members. In extreme cases\r\nexpulsion is resorted to. On the other hand, if any one of the members\r\nhappens to be, from no fault of his own, in pecuniary difficulties,\r\nthe others will assist him. This system of mutual control and mutual\r\nassistance has no doubt something to do with the fact that the Molokanye\r\nare distinguished from the surrounding population by their sobriety,\r\nuprightness, and material prosperity.\r\n\r\nOf the history of the sect my friends in Alexandrof-Hai could tell me\r\nvery little, but I have obtained from other quarters some interesting\r\ninformation. The founder was a peasant of the province of Tambof called\r\nUklein, who lived in the reign of Catherine II., and gained his living\r\nas an itinerant tailor. For some time he belonged to the sect of the\r\nDukhobortsi--who are sometimes called the Russian Quakers, and who have\r\nrecently become known in Western Europe through the efforts of Count\r\nTolstoy on their behalf--but he soon seceded from them, because he could\r\nnot admit their doctrine that God dwells in the human soul, and\r\nthat consequently the chief source of religious truth is internal\r\nenlightenment. To him it seemed that religious truth was to be found\r\nonly in the Scriptures. With this doctrine he soon made many converts,\r\nand one day he unexpectedly entered the town of Tambof, surrounded by\r\nseventy \"Apostles\" chanting psalms. They were all quickly arrested\r\nand imprisoned, and when the affair was reported to St. Petersburg\r\nthe Empress Catherine ordered that they should be handed over to the\r\necclesiastical authorities, and that in the event of their proving\r\nobdurate to exhortation they should be tried by the Criminal Courts.\r\nUklein professed to recant, and was liberated; but he continued his\r\nteaching secretly in the villages, and at the time of his death he was\r\nbelieved to have no less than five thousand followers.\r\n\r\nAs to the actual strength of the sect it is difficult to form even a\r\nconjecture. Certainly it has many thousand members--probably several\r\nhundred thousand. Formerly the Government transported them from the\r\ncentral provinces to the thinly populated outlying districts, where\r\nthey had less opportunity of contaminating Orthodox neighbours; and\r\naccordingly we find them in the southeastern districts of Samara, on the\r\nnorth coast of the Sea of Azof, in the Crimea, in the Caucasus, and\r\nin Siberia. There are still, however, very many of them in the central\r\nregion, especially in the province of Tambof.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which the Molokanye modify their opinions and beliefs\r\nin accordance with what seems to them new light saves them effectually\r\nfrom bigotry and fanaticism, but it at the same time exposes them to\r\nevils of a different kind, from which they might be preserved by a\r\nfew stubborn prejudices. \"False prophets arise among us,\" said an old,\r\nsober-minded member to me on one occasion, \"and lead many away from the\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1835, for example, great excitement was produced among them by\r\nrumours that the second advent of Christ was at hand, and that the\r\nSon of Man, coming to judge the world, was about to appear in the New\r\nJerusalem, somewhere near Mount Ararat. As Elijah and Enoch were to\r\nappear before the opening of the Millennium, they were anxiously\r\nawaited by the faithful, and at last Elijah appeared, in the person of\r\na Melitopol peasant called Belozvorof, who announced that on a given\r\nday he would ascend into heaven. On the day appointed a great crowd\r\ncollected, but he failed to keep his promise, and was handed over to the\r\npolice as an impostor by the Molokanye themselves. Unfortunately they\r\nwere not always so sensible as on that occasion. In the very next year\r\nmany of them were persuaded by a certain Lukian Petrof to put on their\r\nbest garments and start for the Promised Land in the Caucasus, where the\r\nMillennium was about to begin.\r\n\r\nOf these false prophets the most remarkable in recent times was a man\r\nwho called himself Ivan Grigorief, a mysterious personage who had at one\r\ntime a Turkish and at another an American passport, but who seemed in\r\nall other respects a genuine Russian. Some years previously to my visit\r\nhe appeared at Alexandrof-Hai. Though he professed himself to be a good\r\nMolokan and was received as such, he enounced at the weekly meetings\r\nmany new and startling ideas. At first he simply urged his hearers to\r\nlive like the early Christians, and have all things in common. This\r\nseemed sound doctrine to the Molokanye, who profess to take the\r\nearly Christians as their model, and some of them thought of at once\r\nabolishing personal property; but when the teacher intimated pretty\r\nplainly that this communism should include free love, a decided\r\nopposition arose, and it was objected that the early Church did not\r\nrecommend wholesale adultery and cognate sins. This was a formidable\r\nobjection, but \"the prophet\" was equal to the occasion. He reminded his\r\nfriends that in accordance with their own doctrine the Scriptures should\r\nbe understood, not in the literal, but in the spiritual, sense--that\r\nChristianity had made men free, and every true Christian ought to use\r\nhis freedom.\r\n\r\nThis account of the new doctrine was given to me by an intelligent\r\nMolokan, who had formerly been a peasant and was now a trader, as I sat\r\none evening in his house in Novo-usensk, the chief town of the district\r\nin which Alexandrof-Hai is situated. It seemed to me that the author\r\nof this ingenious attempt to conciliate Christianity with extreme\r\nUtilitarianism must be an educated man in disguise. This conviction I\r\ncommunicated to my host, but he did not agree with me.\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not,\" he replied; \"in fact, I am sure he is a peasant,\r\nand I strongly suspect he was at some time a soldier. He has not much\r\nlearning, but he has a wonderful gift of talking; never have I heard any\r\none speak like him. He would have talked over the whole village, had it\r\nnot been for an old man who was more than a match for him. And then\r\nhe went to Orloff-Hai and there he did talk the people over.\" What he\r\nreally did in this latter place I never could clearly ascertain. Report\r\nsaid that he founded a communistic association, of which he was himself\r\npresident and treasurer, and converted the members to an extraordinary\r\ntheory of prophetic succession, invented apparently for his own sensual\r\ngratification. For further information my host advised me to apply\r\neither to the prophet himself, who was at that time confined in the\r\ngaol on a charge of using a forged passport, or to one of his friends, a\r\ncertain Mr. I----, who lived in the town. As it was a difficult\r\nmatter to gain admittance to the prisoner, and I had little time at my\r\ndisposal, I adopted the latter alternative.\r\n\r\nMr. I---- was himself a somewhat curious character. He had been a\r\nstudent in Moscow, and in consequence of some youthful indiscretions\r\nduring the University disturbances had been exiled to this place.\r\nAfter waiting in vain some years for a release, he gave up the idea of\r\nentering one of the learned professions, married a peasant girl, rented\r\na piece of land, bought a pair of camels, and settled down as a small\r\nfarmer.* He had a great deal to tell about the prophet.\r\n\r\n     * Here for the first time I saw camels used for agricultural\r\n     purposes.  When yoked to a small four-wheeled cart, the\r\n     \"ships of the desert\" seemed decidedly out of place.\r\n\r\nGrigorief, it seemed, was really simply a Russian peasant, but he had\r\nbeen from his youth upwards one of those restless people who can never\r\nlong work in harness. Where his native place was, and why he left it,\r\nhe never divulged, for reasons best known to himself. He had travelled\r\nmuch, and had been an attentive observer. Whether he had ever been\r\nin America was doubtful, but he had certainly been in Turkey, and had\r\nfraternised with various Russian sectarians, who are to be found in\r\nconsiderable numbers near the Danube. Here, probably, he acquired many\r\nof his peculiar religious ideas, and conceived his grand scheme of\r\nfounding a new religion--of rivalling the Founder of Christianity! He\r\naimed at nothing less than this, as he on one occasion confessed, and\r\nhe did not see why he should not be successful. He believed that\r\nthe Founder of Christianity had been simply a man like himself,\r\nwho understood better than others the people around him and the\r\ncircumstances of the time, and he was convinced that he himself had\r\nthese qualifications. One qualification, however, for becoming a prophet\r\nhe certainly did not possess: he had no genuine religious enthusiasm in\r\nhim--nothing of the martyr spirit about him. Much of his own preaching\r\nhe did not himself believe, and he had a secret contempt for those who\r\nnaively accepted it all. Not only was he cunning, but he knew he was\r\ncunning, and he was conscious that he was playing an assumed part. And\r\nyet perhaps it would be unjust to say that he was merely an impostor\r\nexclusively occupied with his own personal advantage. Though he was\r\nnaturally a man of sensual tastes, and could not resist convenient\r\nopportunities of gratifying them, he seemed to believe that his\r\ncommunistic schemes would, if realised, be beneficial not only to\r\nhimself, but also to the people. Altogether a curious mixture of the\r\nprophet, the social reformer, and the cunning impostor!\r\n\r\nBesides the Molokanye, there are in Russia many other heretical sects.\r\nSome of them are simply Evangelical Protestants, like the Stundisti, who\r\nhave adopted the religious conceptions of their neighbours, the German\r\ncolonists; whilst others are composed of wild enthusiasts, who give a\r\nloose rein to their excited imagination, and revel in what the Germans\r\naptly term \"der hohere Blodsinn.\" I cannot here attempt to convey even\r\na general idea of these fantastic sects with their doctrinal and\r\nceremonial absurdities, but I may offer the following classification of\r\nthem for the benefit of those who may desire to study the subject:\r\n\r\n1. Sects which take the Scriptures as the basis of their belief, but\r\ninterpret and complete the doctrines therein contained by means of\r\nthe occasional inspiration or internal enlightenment of their leading\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n2. Sects which reject interpretation and insist on certain passages of\r\nScripture being taken in the literal sense. In one of the best known\r\nof these sects--the Skoptsi, or Eunuchs--fanaticism has led to physical\r\nmutilation.\r\n\r\n3. Sects which pay little or no attention to Scripture, and derive their\r\ndoctrine from the supposed inspiration of their living teachers.\r\n\r\n4. Sects which believe in the re-incarnation of Christ.\r\n\r\n5. Sects which confound religion with nervous excitement, and are\r\nmore or less erotic in their character. The excitement necessary for\r\nprophesying is commonly produced by dancing, jumping, pirouetting, or\r\nself-castigation; and the absurdities spoken at such times are regarded\r\nas the direct expression of divine wisdom. The religious exercises\r\nresemble more or less closely those of the \"dancing dervishes\" and\r\n\"howling dervishes\u0027s\" with which all who have visited Constantinople are\r\nfamiliar. There is, however, one important difference: the dervishes\r\npractice their religious exercises in public, and consequently observe a\r\ncertain decorum, whilst these Russian sects assemble in secret, and give\r\nfree scope to their excitement, so that most disgusting orgies sometimes\r\ntake place at their meetings.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the general character of the sects belonging to this last\r\ncategory, I may quote here a short extract from a description of the\r\n\"Khlysti\" by one who was initiated into their mysteries: \"Among them\r\nmen and women alike take upon themselves the calling of teachers and\r\nprophets, and in this character they lead a strict, ascetic life,\r\nrefrain from the most ordinary and innocent pleasures, exhaust\r\nthemselves by long fasting and wild, ecstatic religious exercises, and\r\nabhor marriage. Under the excitement caused by their supposed holiness\r\nand inspiration, they call themselves not only teachers and prophets,\r\nbut also \u0027Saviours,\u0027 \u0027Redeemers,\u0027 \u0027Christs,\u0027 \u0027Mothers of God.\u0027 Generally\r\nspeaking, they call themselves simply Gods, and pray to each other as to\r\nreal Gods and living Christs or Madonnas. When several of these teachers\r\ncome together at a meeting, they dispute with each other in a vain\r\nboasting way as to which of them possesses most grace and power. In this\r\nrivalry they sometimes give each other lusty blows on the ear, and\r\nhe who bears the blows most patiently, turning the other cheek to the\r\nsmiter, acquires the reputation of having most holiness.\"\r\n\r\nAnother sect belonging to this category is the Jumpers, among whom the\r\nerotic element is disagreeably prominent. Here is a description of their\r\nreligious meetings, which are held during summer in the forest, and\r\nduring winter in some out-house or barn: \"After due preparation prayers\r\nare read by the chief teacher, dressed in a white robe and standing in\r\nthe midst of the congregation. At first he reads in an ordinary tone\r\nof voice, and then passes gradually into a merry chant. When he remarks\r\nthat the chanting has sufficiently acted on the hearers, he begins\r\nto jump. The hearers, singing likewise, follow his example. Their\r\never-increasing excitement finds expression in the highest possible\r\njumps. This they continue as long as they can--men and women alike\r\nyelling like enraged savages. When all are thoroughly exhausted, the\r\nleader declares that he hears the angels singing\"--and then begins a\r\nscene which cannot be here described.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add that we know very little of these peculiar sects,\r\nand what we do know is furnished by avowed enemies. It is very possible,\r\ntherefore, that some of them are not nearly so absurd as they are\r\ncommonly represented, and that many of the stories told are mere\r\ncalumnies.\r\n\r\nThe Government is very hostile to sectarianism, and occasionally\r\nendeavours to suppress it. This is natural enough as regards these\r\nfantastic sects, but it seems strange that the peaceful, industrious,\r\nhonest Molokanye and Stundisti should be put under the ban. Why is it\r\nthat a Russian peasant should be punished for holding doctrines which\r\nare openly professed, with the sanction of the authorities, by his\r\nneighbours, the German colonists?\r\n\r\nTo understand this the reader must know that according to Russian\r\nconceptions there are two distinct kinds of heresy, distinguished from\r\neach other, not by the doctrines held, but by the nationality of the\r\nholder, it seems to a Russian in the nature of things that Tartars\r\nshould be Mahometans, that Poles should be Roman Catholics, and that\r\nGermans should be Protestants; and the mere act of becoming a Russian\r\nsubject is not supposed to lay the Tartar, the Pole, or the German under\r\nany obligation to change his faith. These nationalities are therefore\r\nallowed the most perfect freedom in the exercise of their respective\r\nreligions, so long as they refrain from disturbing by propagandism the\r\ndivinely established order of things.\r\n\r\nThis is the received theory, and we must do the Russians the justice to\r\nsay that they habitually act up to it. If the Government has sometimes\r\nattempted to convert alien races, the motive has always been political,\r\nand the efforts have never awakened much sympathy among the people at\r\nlarge, or even among the clergy. In like manner the missionary societies\r\nwhich have sometimes been formed in imitation of the Western nations\r\nhave never received much popular support. Thus with regard to aliens\r\nthis peculiar theory has led to very extensive religious toleration.\r\nWith regard to the Russians themselves the theory has had a very\r\ndifferent effect. If in the nature of things the Tartar is a Mahometan,\r\nthe Pole a Roman Catholic, and the German a Protestant, it is equally in\r\nthe nature of things that the Russian should be a member of the Orthodox\r\nChurch. On this point the written law and public opinion are in perfect\r\naccord. If an Orthodox Russian becomes a Roman Catholic or a Protestant,\r\nhe is amenable to the criminal law, and is at the same time condemned by\r\npublic opinion as an apostate and renegade--almost as a traitor.\r\n\r\nAs to the future of these heretical sects it is impossible to speak\r\nwith confidence. The more gross and fantastic will probably disappear\r\nas primary education spreads among the people; but the Protestant sects\r\nseem to possess much more vitality. For the present, at least, they are\r\nrapidly spreading. I have seen large villages where, according to the\r\ntestimony of the inhabitants, there was not a single heretic fifteen\r\nyears before, and where one-half of the population had already become\r\nMolokanye; and this change, be it remarked, had taken place without any\r\npropagandist organisation. The civil and ecclesiastical authorities were\r\nwell aware of the existence of the movement, but they were powerless\r\nto prevent it. The few efforts which they made were without effect, or\r\nworse than useless. Among the Stundisti corporal punishment was tried as\r\nan antidote--without the concurrence, it is to be hoped, of the central\r\nauthorities--and to the Molokanye of the province of Samara a learned\r\nmonk was sent in the hope of converting them from their errors by\r\nreason and eloquence. What effect the birch-twigs had on the religious\r\nconvictions of the Stundisti I have not been able to ascertain, but I\r\nassume that they were not very efficacious, for according to the latest\r\naccounts the numbers of the sect are increasing. Of the mission in the\r\nprovince of Samara I happen to know more, and can state on the evidence\r\nof many peasants--some of them Orthodox--that the only immediate effect\r\nwas to stir up religious fanaticism, and to induce a certain number of\r\nOrthodox to go over to the heretical camp.\r\n\r\nIn their public discussions the disputants could find no common\r\nground on which to argue, for the simple reason that their fundamental\r\nconceptions were different. The monk spoke of the Church as the\r\nterrestrial representative of Christ and the sole possessor of truth,\r\nwhilst his opponents knew nothing of a Church in this sense, and held\r\nsimply that all men should live in accordance with the dictates of\r\nScripture. Once the monk consented to argue with them on their own\r\nground, and on that occasion he sustained a signal defeat, for he could\r\nnot produce a single passage recommending the veneration of Icons--a\r\npractice which the Russian peasants consider an essential part of\r\nOrthodoxy. After this he always insisted on the authority of the early\r\nEcumenical Councils and the Fathers of the Church--an authority which\r\nhis antagonists did not recognise. Altogether the mission was a complete\r\nfailure, and all parties regretted that it had been undertaken. \"It was\r\na great mistake,\" remarked to me confidentially an Orthodox peasant; \"a\r\nvery great mistake. The Molokanye are a cunning people. The monk was\r\nno match for them; they knew the Scriptures a great deal better than he\r\ndid. The Church should not condescend to discuss with heretics.\"\r\n\r\nIt is often said that these heretical sects are politically disaffected,\r\nand the Molokanye are thought to be specially dangerous in this respect.\r\nPerhaps there is a certain foundation for this opinion, for men\r\nare naturally disposed to doubt the legitimacy of a power that\r\nsystematically persecutes them. With regard to the Molokanye, I believe\r\nthe accusation to be a groundless calumny. Political ideas seemed\r\nentirely foreign to their modes of thought. During my intercourse with\r\nthem I often heard them refer to the police as \"wolves which have to\r\nbe fed,\" but I never heard them speak of the Emperor otherwise than in\r\nterms of filial affection and veneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE DISSENTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nDissenters not to be Confounded with Heretics--Extreme Importance\r\nAttached to Ritual Observances--The Raskol, or Great Schism in the\r\nSeventeenth Century--Antichrist Appears!--Policy of Peter the Great\r\nand Catherine II.--Present Ingenious Method of Securing Religious\r\nToleration--Internal Development of the Raskol--Schism among the\r\nSchismatics--The Old Ritualists--The Priestless People--Cooling of the\r\nFanatical Enthusiasm and Formation of New Sects--Recent Policy of\r\nthe Government towards the Sectarians--Numerical Force and Political\r\nSignificance of Sectarianism.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must be careful not to confound those heretical sects, Protestant and\r\nfantastical, of which I have spoken in the preceding chapter, with the\r\nmore numerous Dissenters or Schismatics, the descendants of those who\r\nseceded from the Russian Church--or more correctly from whom the Russian\r\nChurch seceded--in the seventeenth century. So far from regarding\r\nthemselves as heretics, these latter consider themselves more orthodox\r\nthan the official Orthodox Church. They are conservatives, too, in the\r\nsocial as well as the religious sense of the term. Among them are to\r\nbe found the last remnants of old Russian life, untinged by foreign\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Church, as I have already had occasion to remark, has\r\nalways paid inordinate attention to ceremonial observances and somewhat\r\nneglected the doctrinal and moral elements of the faith which it\r\nprofesses. This peculiarity greatly facilitated the spread of its\r\ninfluence among a people accustomed to pagan rites and magical\r\nincantations, but it had the pernicious effect of confirming in the new\r\nconverts their superstitious belief in the virtue of mere ceremonies.\r\nThus the Russians became zealous Christians in all matters of external\r\nobservance, without knowing much about the spiritual meaning of the\r\nrites which they practised. They looked upon the rites and sacraments\r\nas mysterious charms which preserved them from evil influences in the\r\npresent life and secured them eternal felicity in the life to come, and\r\nthey believed that these charms would inevitably lose their efficacy\r\nif modified in the slightest degree. Extreme importance was therefore\r\nattached to the ritual minutiae, and the slightest modification of these\r\nminutiae assumed the importance of an historical event. In the year\r\n1476, for instance, the Novgorodian Chronicler gravely relates:\r\n\r\n\"This winter some philosophers (!) began to sing, \u0027O Lord, have mercy,\u0027\r\nand others merely, \u0027Lord, have mercy.\u0027\" And this attaching of enormous\r\nimportance to trifles was not confined to the ignorant multitude. An\r\nArchbishop of Novgorod declared solemnly that those who repeat the word\r\n\"Alleluia\" only twice at certain points in the liturgy \"sing to their\r\nown damnation,\" and a celebrated Ecclesiastical Council, held in 1551,\r\nput such matters as the position of the fingers when making the sign of\r\nthe cross on the same level as heresies--formally anathematising those\r\nwho acted in such trifles contrary to its decisions.\r\n\r\nThis conservative spirit in religious concerns had a considerable\r\ninfluence on social life. As there was no clear line of demarcation\r\nbetween religious observances and simple traditional customs, the most\r\nordinary act might receive a religious significance, and the slightest\r\ndeparture from a traditional custom might be looked upon as a deadly\r\nsin. A Russian of the olden time would have resisted the attempt to\r\ndeprive him of his beard as strenuously as a Calvinist of the present\r\nday would resist the attempt to make him abjure the doctrine of\r\nPredestination--and both for the same reason. As the doctrine of\r\nPredestination is for the Calvinist, so the wearing of a beard was for\r\nthe old Russian--an essential of salvation. \"Where,\" asked one of the\r\nPatriarchs of Moscow, \"will those who shave their chins stand at\r\nthe Last Day?--among the righteous adorned with beards, or among the\r\nbeardless heretics?\" The question required no answer.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century this superstitious, conservative spirit\r\nreached its climax. The civil wars and foreign invasions, accompanied by\r\npillage, famine, and plagues with which that century opened, produced\r\na wide-spread conviction that the end of all things was at hand. The\r\nmysterious number of the Beast was found to indicate the year 1666, and\r\ntimid souls began to discover signs of that falling away from the Faith\r\nwhich is spoken of in the Apocalypse. The majority of the people did not\r\nperhaps share this notion, but they believed that the sufferings with\r\nwhich they had been visited were a Divine punishment for having forsaken\r\nthe ancient customs. And it could not be denied that considerable\r\nchanges had taken place. Orthodox Russia was now tainted with the\r\npresence of heretics. Foreigners who shaved their chins and smoked the\r\naccursed weed had been allowed to settle in Moscow, and the Tsars not\r\nonly held converse with them, but had even adopted some of their \"pagan\"\r\npractises. Besides this, the Government had introduced innovations and\r\nreforms, many of which were displeasing to the people. In short, the\r\ncountry was polluted with \"heresy\"--a subtle, evil influence lurking\r\nin everything foreign, and very dangerous to the spiritual and temporal\r\nwelfare of the Faithful--something of the nature of an epidemic, but\r\ninfinitely more dangerous; for disease kills merely the body, whereas\r\n\"heresy\" kills the soul, and causes both soul and body to be cast into\r\nhell-fire.\r\n\r\nHad the Government introduced the innovations slowly and cautiously,\r\nrespecting as far as possible all outward forms, it might have effected\r\nmuch without producing a religious panic; but, instead of acting\r\ncircumspectly as the occasion demanded, it ran full-tilt against the\r\nancient prejudices and superstitious fears, and drove the people into\r\nopen resistance. When the art of printing was introduced, it became\r\nnecessary to choose the best texts of the Liturgy, Psalter, and other\r\nreligious books, and on examination it was found that, through the\r\nignorance and carelessness of copyists, numerous errors had crept into\r\nthe manuscripts in use. This discovery led to further investigation,\r\nwhich showed that certain irregularities had likewise crept into the\r\nceremonial. The chief of the clerical errors lay in the orthography of\r\nthe word \"Jesus,\" and the chief irregularity in the ceremonial regarded\r\nthe position of the fingers when making the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\nTo correct these errors the celebrated Nikon, who was Patriarch in the\r\ntime of Tsar Alexis, father of Peter the Great, ordered all the old\r\nliturgical books and the old Icons to be called in, and new ones to be\r\ndistributed; but the clergy and the people resisted. Believing these\r\n\"Nikonian novelties\" to be heretical, they clung to their old Icons,\r\ntheir old missals and their old religious customs as the sole anchors of\r\nsafety which could save the Faithful from drifting to perdition. In vain\r\nthe Patriarch assured the people that the change was a return to the\r\nancient forms still preserved in Greece and Constantinople. \"The Greek\r\nChurch,\" it was replied, \"is no longer free from heresy. Orthodoxy has\r\nbecome many-coloured from the violence of the Turkish Mahomet; and\r\nthe Greeks, under the sons of Hagar, have fallen away from the ancient\r\ntraditions.\"\r\n\r\nAn anathema, formally pronounced by an Ecclesiastical Council against\r\nthese Nonconformists, had no more effect than the admonitions of the\r\nPatriarch. They persevered in their obstinacy, and refused to believe\r\nthat the blessed saints and holy martyrs who had used the ancient forms\r\nhad not prayed and crossed themselves aright. \"Not those holy men of\r\nold, but the present Patriarch and his counsellors must be heretics.\"\r\n\"Woe to us! Woe to us!\" cried the monks of Solovetsk when they received\r\nthe new Liturgies. \"What have you done with the Son of God? Give him\r\nback to us! You have changed Isus [the old Russian form of Jesus] into\r\nIisus! It is fearful not only to commit such a sin, but even to think\r\nof it!\" And the sturdy monks shut their gates, and defied Patriarch,\r\nCouncil, and Tsar for seven long years, till the monastery was taken by\r\nan armed force.\r\n\r\nThe decree of excommunication pronounced by the Ecclesiastical Council\r\nplaced the Nonconformists beyond the pale of the Church, and the civil\r\npower undertook the task of persecuting them. Persecution had of course\r\nmerely the effect of confirming the victims in their belief that the\r\nChurch and the Tsar had become heretical. Thousands fled across the\r\nfrontier and settled in the neighbouring countries--Poland, Russia,\r\nSweden, Austria, Turkey, the Caucasus, and Siberia. Others concealed\r\nthemselves in the northern forests and the densely wooded region near\r\nthe Polish frontier, where they lived by agriculture or fishing, and\r\nprayed, crossed themselves and buried their dead according to the\r\ncustoms of their forefathers. The northern forests were their favourite\r\nplace of refuge. Hither flocked many of those who wished to keep\r\nthemselves pure and undefiled. Here the more learned men among the\r\nNonconformists--well acquainted with Holy Writ, with fragmentary\r\ntranslations from the Greek Fathers, and with the more important\r\ndecisions of the early Ecumenical Councils--wrote polemical and edifying\r\nworks for the confounding of heretics and the confirming of true\r\nbelievers. Hence were sent out in all directions zealous missionaries,\r\nin the guise of traders, peddlers, and labourers, to sow what they\r\ncalled the living seed, and what the official Church termed \"Satan\u0027s\r\ntares.\" When the Government agents discovered these retreats, the\r\ninmates generally fled from the \"ravenous wolves\"; but on more than one\r\noccasion a large number of fanatical men and women, shutting themselves\r\nup, set fire to their houses, and voluntarily perished in the flames.\r\nIn Paleostrofski Monastery, for instance, in the year 1687, no less\r\nthan 2,700 fanatics gained the crown of martyrdom in this way; and many\r\nsimilar instances are on record.* As in all periods of religious panic,\r\nthe Apocalypse was carefully studied, and the Millennial ideas rapidly\r\nspread. The signs of the time were plain: Satan was being let loose\r\nfor a little season. Men anxiously looked for the reappearance of\r\nAntichrist--and Antichrist appeared!\r\n\r\n     * A list of well-authenticated cases is given by Nilski,\r\n     \"Semeinaya zhizn v russkom Raskole,\" St. Petersburg, 1869;\r\n     part I., pp. 55-57. The number of these self-immolators\r\n     certainly amounted to many thousands.\r\n\r\nThe man in whom the people recognised the incarnate spirit of evil was\r\nno other than Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nFrom the Nonconformist point of view, Peter had very strong claims to be\r\nconsidered Antichrist. He had none of the staid, pious demeanour of the\r\nold Tsars, and showed no respect for many things which were venerated\r\nby the people. He ate, drank, and habitually associated with heretics,\r\nspoke their language, wore their costume, chose from among them his most\r\nintimate friends, and favoured them more than his own people. Imagine\r\nthe horror and commotion which would be produced among pious Catholics\r\nif the Pope should some day appear in the costume of the Grand Turk, and\r\nshould choose Pashas as his chief counsellors! The horror which Peter\u0027s\r\nconduct produced among a large section of his subjects was not less\r\ngreat. They could not explain it otherwise than by supposing him to\r\nbe the Devil in disguise, and they saw in all his important measures\r\nconvincing proofs of his Satanic origin. The newly invented census, or\r\n\"revision,\" was a profane \"numbering of the people,\" and an attempt to\r\nenrol in the service of Beëlzebub those whose names were written in the\r\nLamb\u0027s Book of Life. The new title of Imperator was explained to mean\r\nsomething very diabolical. The passport bearing the Imperial arms was\r\nthe seal of Antichrist. The order to shave the beard was an attempt to\r\ndisfigure \"the image of God,\" after which man had been created, and by\r\nwhich Christ would recognise His own at the Last Day. The change in\r\nthe calendar, by which New Year\u0027s Day was transferred from September\r\nto January, was the destruction of \"the years of our Lord,\" and the\r\nintroduction of the years of Satan in their place. Of the ingenious\r\narguments by which these theses were supported, I may quote one by\r\nway of illustration. The world, it was explained, could not have been\r\ncreated in January as the new calendar seemed to indicate, because\r\napples are not ripe at that season, and consequently Eve could not have\r\nbeen tempted in the way described!*\r\n\r\n     * I found this ingenious argument in one of the polemical\r\n     treatises of the Old Believers.\r\n\r\nThese ideas regarding Peter and his reforms were strongly confirmed by\r\nthe vigorous persecutions which took place during the earlier years of\r\nhis reign. The Nonconformists were constantly convicted of political\r\ndisaffection--especially of \"insulting the Imperial Majesty\"--and were\r\naccordingly flogged, tortured, and beheaded without mercy. But when\r\nPeter had succeeded in putting down all armed opposition, and found that\r\nthe movement was no longer dangerous for the throne, he adopted a policy\r\nmore in accordance with his personal character. Whether he had himself\r\nany religious belief whatever may be doubted; certainly he had not a\r\nspark of religious fanaticism in his nature. Exclusively occupied with\r\nsecular concerns, he took no interest in subtle questions of religious\r\nceremonial, and was profoundly indifferent as to how his subjects prayed\r\nand crossed themselves, provided they obeyed his orders in worldly\r\nmatters and paid their taxes regularly. As soon, therefore, as political\r\nconsiderations admitted of clemency, he stopped the persecutions, and\r\nat last, in 1714, issued ukazes to the effect that all Dissenters might\r\nlive unmolested, provided they inscribed themselves in the official\r\nregisters and paid a double poll-tax. Somewhat later they were allowed\r\nto practise freely all their old rites and customs, on condition of\r\npaying certain fines.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Catherine II., \"the friend of philosophers,\" the\r\nRaskol,* as the schism had come to be called, entered on a new phase.\r\nPenetrated with the ideas of religious toleration then in fashion\r\nin Western Europe, Catherine abolished the disabilities to which the\r\nRaskolniks were subjected, and invited those of them who had fled\r\nacross the frontier to return to their homes. Thousands accepted the\r\ninvitation, and many who had hitherto sought to conceal themselves from\r\nthe eyes of the authorities became rich and respected merchants. The\r\npeculiar semi-monastic religious communities, which had up till that\r\ntime existed only in the forests of the northern and western provinces,\r\nbegan to appear in Moscow, and were officially recognised by the\r\nAdministration. At first they took the form of hospitals for the\r\nsick, or asylums for the aged and infirm, but soon they became regular\r\nmonasteries, the superiors of which exercised an undefined spiritual\r\nauthority not only over the inmates, but also over the members of the\r\nsect throughout the length and breadth of the Empire.\r\n\r\n     * The term is derived from two Russian words--ras, asunder;\r\n     and kolot, to split.  Those who belong to the Raskol are\r\n     called Raskolniki.  They call themselves Staro-obriadtsi\r\n     (Old Ritualists) or Staroveri (Old Believers).\r\n\r\nFrom that time down to the present the Government has followed a\r\nwavering policy, oscillating between complete tolerance and active\r\npersecution. It must, however, be said that the persecution has\r\nnever been of a very searching kind. In persecution, as in all other\r\nmanifestations, the Russian Church directs its attention chiefly\r\nto external forms. It does not seek to ferret out heresy in a man\u0027s\r\nopinions, but complacently accepts as Orthodox all who annually\r\nappear at confession and communion, and who refrain from acts of open\r\nhostility. Those who can make these concessions to convenience are\r\npractically free from molestation, and those who cannot so trifle\r\nwith their conscience have an equally convenient method of escaping\r\npersecution. The parish clergy, with their customary indifference\r\nto things spiritual and their traditional habit of regarding their\r\nfunctions from the financial point of view, are hostile to sectarianism\r\nchiefly because it diminishes their revenues by diminishing the number\r\nof parishioners requiring their ministrations. This cause of hostility\r\ncan easily be removed by a certain pecuniary sacrifice on the part of\r\nthe sectarians, and accordingly there generally exists between them\r\nand their parish priest a tacit contract, by which both parties are\r\nperfectly satisfied. The priest receives his income as if all his\r\nparishioners belonged to the State Church, and the parishioners are\r\nleft in peace to believe and practise what they please. By this rude,\r\nconvenient method a very large amount of toleration is effectually\r\nsecured. Whether the practise has a beneficial moral influence on the\r\nparish clergy is, of course, an entirely different question.\r\n\r\nWhen the priest has been satisfied, there still remains the police,\r\nwhich likewise levies an irregular tax on heterodoxy; but the\r\nnegotiations are generally not difficult, for it is in the interest of\r\nboth parties that they should come to terms and live in good-fellowship.\r\nThus practically the Raskolniki live in the same condition as in the\r\ntime of Peter: they pay a tax and are not molested--only the money paid\r\ndoes not now find its way into the Imperial Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThese external changes in the history of the Raskol have exercised a\r\npowerful influence on its internal development.\r\n\r\nWhen formally anathematised and excluded from the dominant Church the\r\nNonconformists had neither a definite organisation nor a positive creed.\r\nThe only tie that bound them together was hostility to the \"Nikonian\r\nnovelties,\" and all they desired was to preserve intact the beliefs and\r\ncustoms of their forefathers. At first they never thought of creating\r\nany permanent organisation. The more moderate believed that the Tsar\r\nwould soon re-establish Orthodoxy, and the more fanatical imagined that\r\nthe end of all things was at hand.* In either case they had only to\r\nsuffer for a little season, keeping themselves free from the taint of\r\nheresy and from all contact with the kingdom of Antichrist.\r\n\r\n     * Some had coffins made, and lay down in them at night, in\r\n     the expectation that the Second Advent might take place\r\n     before the morning.\r\n\r\nBut years passed, and neither of these expectations was fulfilled. The\r\nfanatics awaited in vain the sound of the last trump and the appearance\r\nof Christ, coming with His angels to judge the world. The sun continued\r\nto rise, and the seasons followed each other in their accustomed course,\r\nbut the end was not yet. Nor did the civil power return to the old\r\nfaith. Nikon fell a victim to Court intrigues and his own overweening\r\npride, and was formally deposed. Tsar Alexis in the fulness of time was\r\ngathered unto his fathers. But there was no sign of a re-establishment\r\nof the old Orthodoxy. Gradually the leading Raskolniki perceived that\r\nthey must make preparations, not for the Day of Judgment, but for\r\na terrestrial future--that they must create some permanent form of\r\necclesiastical organisation. In this work they encountered at the very\r\noutset not only practical, but also theoretical difficulties.\r\n\r\nSo long as they confined themselves simply to resisting the official\r\ninnovations, they seemed to be unanimous; but when they were forced to\r\nabandon this negative policy and to determine theoretically their new\r\nposition, radical differences of opinion became apparent. All were\r\nconvinced that the official Russian Church had become heretical, and\r\nthat it had now Antichrist instead of Christ as its head; but it was not\r\neasy to determine what should be done by those who refused to bow the\r\nknee to the Son of Destruction. According to Protestant conceptions\r\nthere was a very simple solution of the difficulty: the Nonconformists\r\nhad simply to create a new Church for themselves, and worship God in\r\nthe way that seemed good to them. But to the Russians of that time such\r\nnotions were still more repulsive than the innovations of Nikon. These\r\nmen were Orthodox to the backbone--\"plus royalistes que le roi\"--and\r\naccording to Orthodox conceptions the founding of a new Church is an\r\nabsurdity. They believed that if the chain of historic continuity were\r\nonce broken, the Church must necessarily cease to exist, in the same way\r\nas an ancient family becomes extinct when its sole representative dies\r\nwithout issue. If, therefore, the Church had already ceased to exist,\r\nthere was no longer any means of communication between Christ and His\r\npeople, the sacraments were no longer efficacious, and mankind was\r\nforever deprived of the ordinary means of grace.\r\n\r\nNow, on this important point there was a difference of opinion among\r\nthe Dissenters. Some of them believed that, though the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities had become heretical, the Church still existed in the\r\ncommunion of those who had refused to accept the innovations. Others\r\ndeclared boldly that the Orthodox Church had ceased to exist, that\r\nthe ancient means of grace had been withdrawn, and that those who\r\nhad remained faithful must thenceforth seek salvation, not in the\r\nsacraments, but in prayer and such other religious exercises as did not\r\nrequire the co-operation of duly consecrated priests. Thus took place a\r\nschism among the Schismatics. The one party retained all the sacraments\r\nand ceremonial observances in the older form; the other refrained from\r\nthe sacraments and from many of the ordinary rites, on the ground\r\nthat there was no longer a real priesthood, and that consequently\r\nthe sacraments could not be efficacious. The former party are\r\ntermed Staro-obriadsti, or Old Ritualists; the latter are called\r\nBezpopoftsi--that is to say, people \"without priests\" (bez popov).\r\n\r\nThe succeeding history of these two sections of the Nonconformists has\r\nbeen widely different. The Old Ritualists, being simply ecclesiastical\r\nConservatives desirous of resisting all innovations, have remained a\r\ncompact body little troubled by differences of opinion. The Priestless\r\nPeople, on the contrary, ever seeking to discover some new effectual\r\nmeans of salvation, have fallen into an endless number of independent\r\nsects.\r\n\r\nThe Old Ritualists had still, however, one important theoretical\r\ndifficulty. At first they had amongst themselves plenty of consecrated\r\npriests for the celebration of the ordinances, but they had no means\r\nof renewing the supply. They had no bishops, and according to Orthodox\r\nbelief the lower degrees of the clergy cannot be created without\r\nepiscopal consecration. At the time of the schism one bishop had thrown\r\nin his lot with the Schismatics, but he had died shortly afterwards\r\nwithout leaving a successor, and thereafter no bishop had joined their\r\nranks. As time wore on, the necessity of episcopal consecration came to\r\nbe more and more felt, and it is not a little interesting to observe\r\nhow these rigorists, who held to the letter of the law and declared\r\nthemselves ready to die for a jot or a tittle, modified their theory\r\nin accordance with the changing exigencies of their position. When the\r\npriests who had kept themselves \"pure and undefiled\"--free from all\r\ncontact with Antichrist--became scarce, it was discovered that certain\r\npriests of the dominant Church might be accepted if they formally\r\nabjured the Nikonian novelties. At first, however, only those who had\r\nbeen consecrated previous to the supposed apostasy of the Church were\r\naccepted, for the very good reason that consecration by bishops who had\r\nbecome heretical could not be efficacious. When these could no longer be\r\nobtained it was discovered that those who had been baptised previous to\r\nthe apostasy might be accepted; and when even these could no longer\r\nbe found, a still further concession was made to necessity, and all\r\nconsecrated priests were received on condition of their solemnly\r\nabjuring their errors. Of such priests there was always an abundant\r\nsupply. If a regular priest could not find a parish, or if he was\r\ndeposed by the authorities for some crime or misdemeanour, he had merely\r\nto pass over to the Old Ritualists, and was sure to find among them a\r\nhearty welcome and a tolerable salary.\r\n\r\nBy these concessions the indefinite prolongation of Old Ritualism was\r\nsecured, but many of the Old Ritualists could not but feel that their\r\nposition was, to say the least, extremely anomalous. They had no bishops\r\nof their own, and their priests were all consecrated by bishops whom\r\nthey believed to be heretical! For many years they hoped to escape\r\nfrom this dilemma by discovering \"Orthodox\"--that is to say, Old\r\nRitualist--bishops somewhere in the East; but when the East had been\r\nsearched in vain, and all their efforts to obtain native bishops proved\r\nfruitless, they conceived the design of creating a bishopric somewhere\r\nbeyond the frontier, among the Old Ritualists who had in times of\r\npersecution fled to Prussia, Austria, and Turkey. There were, however,\r\nimmense difficulties in the way. In the first place it was necessary\r\nto obtain the formal permission of some foreign Government; and in the\r\nsecond place an Orthodox bishop must be found, willing to consecrate an\r\nOld Ritualist or to become an Old Ritualist himself. Again and again\r\nthe attempt was made, and failed; but at last, after years of effort and\r\nintrigue, the design was realised. In 1844 the Austrian Government gave\r\npermission to found a bishopric at Belaya Krinitsa, in Galicia, a\r\nfew miles from the Russian frontier; and two years later the deposed\r\nMetropolitan of Bosnia consented, after much hesitation, to pass over to\r\nthe Old Ritualist confession and accept the diocese.* From that time the\r\nOld Ritualists have had their own bishops, and have not been obliged to\r\naccept the runaway priests of the official Church.\r\n\r\n     * An interesting account of these negotiations, and a most\r\n     curious picture of the Orthodox ecclesiastical world in\r\n     Constantinople, is given by Subbotiny, \"Istoria\r\n     Belokrinitskoi Ierarkhii,\" Moscow, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe Old Ritualists were naturally much grieved by the schism, and\r\nwere often sorely tried by persecution, but they have always enjoyed a\r\ncertain spiritual tranquillity, proceeding from the conviction that they\r\nhave preserved for themselves the means of salvation. The position of\r\nthe more extreme section of the Schismatics was much more tragical. They\r\nbelieved that the sacraments had irretrievably lost their efficacy, that\r\nthe ordinary means of salvation were forever withdrawn, that the powers\r\nof darkness had been let loose for a little season, that the authorities\r\nwere the agents of Satan, and that the personage who filled the place\r\nof the old God-fearing Tsars was no other than Antichrist. Under the\r\ninfluence of these horrible ideas they fled to the woods and the caves\r\nto escape from the rage of the Beast, and to await the second coming of\r\nOur Lord.\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not continue permanently. Extreme religious\r\nfanaticism, like all other abnormal states, cannot long exist in a\r\nmass of human beings without some constant exciting cause. The vulgar\r\nnecessities of everyday life, especially among people who have to live\r\nby the labour of their hands, have a wonderfully sobering influence\r\non the excited brain, and must always, sooner or later, prove fatal to\r\ninordinate excitement. A few peculiarly constituted individuals may show\r\nthemselves capable of a lifelong enthusiasm, but the multitude is ever\r\nspasmodic in its fervour, and begins to slide back to its former apathy\r\nas soon as the exciting cause ceases to act.\r\n\r\nAll this we find exemplified in the history of the Priestless People.\r\nWhen it was found that the world did not come to an end, and that the\r\nrigorous system of persecution was relaxed, the less excitable natures\r\nreturned to their homes, and resumed their old mode of life; and when\r\nPeter the Great made his politic concessions, many who had declared him\r\nto be Antichrist came to suspect that he was really not so black as he\r\nwas painted. This idea struck deep root in a religious community near\r\nLake Onega (Vuigovski Skit) which had received special privileges on\r\ncondition of supplying labourers for the neighbouring mines; and here\r\nwas developed a new theory which opened up a way of reconciliation with\r\nthe Government. By a more attentive study of Holy Writ and ancient books\r\nit was discovered that the reign of Antichrist would consist of two\r\nperiods. In the former, the Son of Destruction would reign merely in\r\nthe spiritual sense, and the Faithful would not be much molested; in the\r\nlatter, he would reign visibly in the flesh, and true believers would be\r\nsubjected to the most frightful persecution. The second period, it was\r\nheld, had evidently not yet arrived, for the Faithful now enjoyed \"a\r\ntime of freedom, and not of compulsion or oppression.\" Whether this\r\ntheory is strictly in accordance with Apocalyptic prophecy and patristic\r\ntheology may be doubted, but it fully satisfied those who had already\r\narrived at the conclusion by a different road, and who sought merely\r\na means of justifying their position. Certain it is that very many\r\naccepted it, and determined to render unto Caesar the things that were\r\nCaesar\u0027s, or, in secular language, to pray for the Tsar and to pay their\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious compromise was not accepted by all the Priestless People.\r\nOn the contrary, many of them regarded it as a woeful backsliding--a new\r\ndevice of the Evil One; and among these irreconcilables was a certain\r\npeasant called Theodosi, a man of little education, but of remarkable\r\nintellectual power and unusual strength of character. He raised anew\r\nthe old fanaticism by his preaching and writings--widely circulated in\r\nmanuscript--and succeeded in founding a new sect in the forest region\r\nnear the Polish frontier.\r\n\r\nThe Priestless Nonconformists thus fell into two sections; the one,\r\ncalled Pomortsi,* accepted at least a partial reconciliation with the\r\ncivil power; the other, called Theodosians, after their founder, held\r\nto the old opinions, and refused to regard the Tsar otherwise than as\r\nAntichrist.\r\n\r\n     *The word Pomortsi means \"those who live near the seashore.\"\r\n     It is commonly applied to the inhabitants of the Northern\r\n     provinces--that is, those who live near the shore of the\r\n     White Sea, the only maritime frontier that Russia possessed\r\n     previous to the conquests of Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nThese latter were at first very wild in their fanaticism, but ere long\r\nthey gave way to the influences which had softened the fanaticism of the\r\nPomortsi. Under the liberal, conciliatory rule of Catherine they lived\r\nin contentment, and many of them enriched themselves by trade. Their\r\nfanatical zeal and exclusiveness evaporated under the influence\r\nof material well-being and constant contact with the outer world,\r\nespecially after they were allowed to build a monastery in Moscow.\r\nThe Superior of this monastery, a man of much shrewdness and enormous\r\nwealth, succeeded in gaining the favour not only of the lower officials,\r\nwho could be easily bought, but even of high-placed dignitaries, and for\r\nmany years he exercised a very real, if undefined, authority over all\r\nsections of the Priestless People. \"His fame,\" it is said, \"sounded\r\nthroughout Moscow, and the echoes were heard in Petropol (St.\r\nPetersburg), Riga, Astrakhan, Nizhni-Novgorod, and other lands\r\nof piety\"; and when deputies came to consult him, they prostrated\r\nthemselves in his presence, as before the great ones of the earth.\r\nLiving thus not only in peace and plenty, but even in honour and luxury,\r\n\"the proud Patriarch of the Theodosian Church\" could not consistently\r\nfulminate against \"the ravenous wolves\" with whom he was on friendly\r\nterms, or excite the fanaticism of his followers by highly coloured\r\ndescriptions of \"the awful sufferings and persecution of God\u0027s people\r\nin these latter days,\" as the founder of the sect had been wont to do.\r\nThough he could not openly abandon any fundamental doctrines, he allowed\r\nthe ideas about the reign of Antichrist to fall into the background,\r\nand taught by example, if not by precept, that the Faithful might, by\r\nprudent concessions, live very comfortably in this present evil world.\r\nThis seed fell upon soil already prepared for its reception. The\r\nFaithful gradually forgot their old savage fanaticism, and they have\r\nsince contrived, while holding many of their old ideas in theory, to\r\naccommodate themselves in practice to the existing order of things.\r\n\r\nThe gradual softening and toning down of the original fanaticism in\r\nthese two sects are strikingly exemplified in their ideas of marriage.\r\nAccording to Orthodox doctrine, marriage is a sacrament which can\r\nonly be performed by a consecrated priest, and consequently for the\r\nPriestless People the celebration of marriage was an impossibility.\r\nIn the first ages of sectarianism a state of celibacy was quite in\r\naccordance with their surroundings. Living in constant fear of their\r\npersecutors, and wandering from one place of refuge to another, the\r\nsufferers for the Faith had little time or inclination to think of\r\nfamily ties, and readily listened to the monks, who exhorted them to\r\nmortify the lusts of the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe result, however, proved that celibacy in the creed by no means\r\nensures chastity in practice. Not only in the villages of the\r\nDissenters, but even in those religious communities which professed\r\na more ascetic mode of life, a numerous class of \"orphans\" began to\r\nappear, who knew not who their parents were; and this ignorance of\r\nblood-relationship naturally led to incestuous connections. Besides\r\nthis, the doctrine of celibacy had grave practical inconveniences, for\r\nthe peasant requires a housewife to attend to domestic concerns and\r\nto help him in his agricultural occupations. Thus the necessity of\r\nre-establishing family life came to be felt, and the feeling soon found\r\nexpression in a doctrinal form both among the Pomortsi and among the\r\nTheodsians. Learned dissertations were written and disseminated in\r\nmanuscript copies, violent discussions took place, and at last a great\r\nCouncil was held in Moscow to discuss the question.* The point at issue\r\nwas never unanimously decided, but many accepted the ingenious arguments\r\nin favour of matrimony, and contracted marriages which were, of course,\r\nnull and void in the eye of the law and of the Church, but valid in all\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\n     * I cannot here enter into the details of this remarkable\r\n     controversy, but I may say that in studying it I have been\r\n     frequently astonished by the dialectical power and logical\r\n     subtlety displayed by the disputants, some of them simple\r\n     peasants.\r\n\r\nThis new backsliding of the unstable multitude produced a new outburst\r\nof fanaticism among the stubborn few. Some of those who had hitherto\r\nsought to conceal the origin of the \"orphan\" class above referred to\r\nnow boldly asserted that the existence of this class was a religious\r\nnecessity, because in order to be saved men must repent, and in order\r\nto repent men must sin! At the same time the old ideas about Antichrist\r\nwere revived and preached with fervour by a peasant called Philip, who\r\nfounded a new sect called the Philipists. This sect still exists. They\r\nhold fast to the old belief that the Tsar is Antichrist, and that the\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical authorities are the servants of Satan--an\r\nidea that was kept alive by the corruption and extortion for which the\r\nAdministration was notorious. They do not venture on open resistance\r\nto the authorities, but the bolder members take little pains to conceal\r\ntheir opinions and sentiments, and may be easily recognised by their\r\nsevere aspect, their Puritanical manner, and their Pharisaical horror of\r\neverything which they suppose heretical and unclean. Some of them, it is\r\nsaid, carry this fastidiousness to such an extent that they throw away\r\nthe handle of a door if it has been touched by a heretic!\r\n\r\nIt may seem that we have here reached the extreme limits of fanaticism,\r\nbut in reality there were men whom even the Pharisaical Puritanism of\r\nthe Philipists did not satisfy. These new zealots, who appeared in the\r\ntime of Catherine II., but first became known to the official world in\r\nthe reign of Nicholas I., rebuked the lukewarmness of their brethren,\r\nand founded a new sect in order to preserve intact the asceticism\r\npractised immediately after the schism. This sect still exists. They\r\ncall themselves \"Christ\u0027s people\" (Christoviye Lyudi), but are better\r\nknown under the popular name of \"Wanderers\" (Stranniki), or \"Fugitives\"\r\n(Beguny). Of all the sects they are the most hostile to the existing\r\npolitical and social organisation. Not content with condemning\r\nthe military conscription, the payment of taxes, the acceptance of\r\npassports, and everything connected with the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities, they consider it sinful to live peaceably among an\r\northodox--that is, according to their belief, a heretical--population,\r\nand to have dealings with any who do not share their extreme views.\r\nHolding the Antichrist doctrine in the extreme form, they declare that\r\nTsars are the vessels of Satan, that the Established Church is the\r\ndwelling-place of the Father of Lies, and that all who submit to the\r\nauthorities are children of the Devil. According to this creed, those\r\nwho wish to escape from the wrath to come must have neither houses nor\r\nfixed places of abode, must sever all ties that bind them to the world,\r\nand must wander about continually from place to place. True Christians\r\nare but strangers and pilgrims in the present life, and whoso binds\r\nhimself to the world will perish with the world.\r\n\r\nSuch is the theory of these Wanderers, but among them, as among the less\r\nfanatical sects, practical necessities have produced concessions and\r\ncompromises. As it is impossible to lead a nomadic life in Russian\r\nforests, the Wanderers have been compelled to admit into their ranks\r\nwhat may be called lay-brethren--men who nominally belong to the sect,\r\nbut who live like ordinary mortals and have some rational way of gaining\r\na livelihood. These latter live in the villages or towns, support\r\nthemselves by agriculture or trade, accept passports from the\r\nauthorities, pay their taxes regularly, and conduct themselves in\r\nall outward respects like loyal subjects. Their chief religious duty\r\nconsists in giving food and shelter to their more zealous brethren, who\r\nhave adopted a vagabond life in practise as well as in theory. It is\r\nonly when they feel death approaching that they consider it necessary\r\nto separate themselves from the heretical world, and they effect this\r\nby having themselves carried out to some neighbouring wood--or into a\r\ngarden if there is no wood at hand--where they may die in the open air.\r\n\r\nThus, we see, there is among the Russian Nonconformist sects what may be\r\ncalled a gradation of fanaticism, in which is reflected the history of\r\nthe Great Schism. In the Wanderers we have the representatives of\r\nthose who adopted and preserved the Antichrist doctrine in its extreme\r\nform--the successors of those who fled to the forests to escape from\r\nthe rage of the Beast and to await the second coming of Christ. In the\r\nPhilipists we have the representatives of those who adopted these ideas\r\nin a somewhat softer form, and who came to recognise the necessity of\r\nhaving some regular means of subsistence until the last trump should be\r\nheard. The Theodosians represent those who were in theory at one with\r\nthe preceding category, but who, having less religious fanaticism,\r\nconsidered it necessary to yield to force and make peace with the\r\nGovernment without sacrificing their convictions. In the Pomortsi we see\r\nthose who preserved only the religious ideas of the schism, and became\r\nreconciled with the civil power. Lastly we have the Old Ritualists, who\r\ndiffered from all the other sects in retaining the old ordinances, and\r\nwho simply rejected the spiritual authority of the dominant Church.\r\nBesides these chief sections of the Nonconformists there are a great\r\nmany minor denominations (tolki), differing from each other on minor\r\npoints of doctrine. In certain districts, it is said, nearly every\r\nvillage has one or two independent sects. This is especially the case\r\namong the Don Cossacks and the Cossacks of the Ural, who are in part\r\ndescendants of the men who fled from the early persecutions.\r\n\r\nOf all the sects the Old Ritualists stand nearest to the official\r\nChurch. They hold the same dogmas, practise the same rites, and\r\ndiffer only in trifling ceremonial matters, which few people consider\r\nessential. In the hope of inducing them to return to the official\r\nfold the Government created at the beginning of last century special\r\nchurches, in which they were allowed to retain their ceremonial\r\npeculiarities on condition of accepting regularly consecrated priests\r\nand submitting to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. As yet the design has not\r\nmet with much success. The great majority of the Old Ritualists regard\r\nit as a trap, and assert that the Church in making this concession\r\nhas been guilty of self-contradiction. \"The Ecclesiastical Council of\r\nMoscow,\" they say, \"anathematised our forefathers for holding to the old\r\nritual, and declared that the whole course of nature would be changed\r\nsooner than the curse be withdrawn. The course of nature has not been\r\nchanged, but the anathema has been cancelled.\" This argument ought to\r\nhave a certain weight with those who believe in the infallibility of\r\nEcclesiastical Councils.\r\n\r\nTowards the Priestless People the Government has always acted in a much\r\nless conciliatory spirit. Its severity has been sometimes justified on\r\nthe ground that sectarianism has had a political as well as a religious\r\nsignificance. A State like Russia cannot overlook the existence of\r\nsects which preach the duty of systematic resistance to the civil and\r\necclesiastical authorities and hold doctrines which lead to the grossest\r\nimmorality. This argument, it must be admitted, is not without a certain\r\nforce, but it seems to me that the policy adopted tended to increase\r\nrather than diminish the evils which it sought to cure. Instead of\r\ndispelling the absurd idea that the Tsar was Antichrist by a system\r\nof strict and evenhanded justice, punishing merely actual crimes and\r\ndelinquencies, the Government confirmed the notion in the minds of\r\nthousands by persecuting those who had committed no crime and who\r\ndesired merely to worship God according to their conscience. Above all\r\nit erred in opposing and punishing those marriages which, though legally\r\nirregular, were the best possible means of diminishing fanaticism, by\r\nleading back the fanatics to healthy social life. Fortunately these\r\nerrors have now been abandoned. A policy of greater clemency and\r\nconciliation has been adopted, and has proved much more efficacious than\r\npersecution. The Dissenters have not returned to the official fold, but\r\nthey have lost much of their old fanaticism and exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nIn respect of numbers the sectarians compose a very formidable body. Of\r\nOld Ritualists and Priestless People there are, it is said, no less\r\nthan eleven millions; and the Protestant and fantastical sects comprise\r\nprobably about five millions more. If these numbers be correct, the\r\nsectarians constitute about an eighth of the whole population of the\r\nEmpire. They count in their ranks none of the nobles--none of the\r\nso-called enlightened class--but they include in their number a\r\nrespectable proportion of the peasants, a third of the rich merchant\r\nclass, the majority of the Don Cossacks, and nearly all the Cossacks of\r\nthe Ural.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is important to know how far the sectarians\r\nare politically disaffected. Some people imagine that in the event of\r\nan insurrection or a foreign invasion they might rise against the\r\nGovernment, whilst others believe that this supposed danger is purely\r\nimaginary. For my own part I agree with the latter opinion, which is\r\nstrongly supported by the history of many important events, such as\r\nthe French invasion in 1812, the Crimean War, and the last Polish\r\ninsurrection. The great majority of the Schismatics and heretics are, I\r\nbelieve, loyal subjects of the Tsar. The more violent sects, which are\r\nalone capable of active hostility against the authorities, are weak in\r\nnumbers, and regard all outsiders with such profound mistrust that they\r\nare wholly impervious to inflammatory influences from without. Even if\r\nall the sects were capable of active hostility, they would not be nearly\r\nso formidable as their numbers seem to indicate, for they are hostile to\r\neach other, and are wholly incapable of combining for a common purpose.\r\n\r\nThough sectarianism is thus by no means a serious political danger,\r\nit has nevertheless a considerable political significance. It proves\r\nsatisfactorily that the Russian people is by no means so docile and\r\npliable as is commonly supposed, and that it is capable of showing\r\na stubborn, passive resistance to authority when it believes great\r\ninterests to be at stake. The dogged energy which it has displayed in\r\nasserting for centuries its religious liberty may perhaps some day be\r\nemployed in the arena of secular politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCHURCH AND STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russian Orthodox Church--Russia Outside of the Mediaeval Papal\r\nCommonwealth--Influence of the Greek Church--Ecclesiastical History of\r\nRussia--Relations between Church and State--Eastern Orthodoxy and the\r\nRussian National Church--The Synod--Ecclesiastical Grumbling--Local\r\nEcclesiastical Administration--The Black Clergy and the Monasteries--The\r\nCharacter of the Eastern Church Reflected in the History of Religious\r\nArt--Practical Consequences--The Union Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the curious world of heretics and Dissenters let us pass now to\r\nthe Russian Orthodox Church, to which the great majority of the Russian\r\npeople belong. It has played an important part in the national history,\r\nand has exercised a powerful influence in the formation of the national\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nRussians are in the habit of patriotically and proudly congratulating\r\nthemselves on the fact that their forefathers always resisted\r\nsuccessfully the aggressive tendencies of the Papacy, but it may be\r\ndoubted whether, from a worldly point of view, the freedom from Papal\r\nauthority has been an unmixed blessing for the country. If the Popes\r\nfailed to realise their grand design of creating a vast European empire\r\nbased on theocratic principles, they succeeded at least in inspiring\r\nwith a feeling of brotherhood and a vague consciousness of common\r\ninterest all the nations which acknowledged their spiritual supremacy.\r\nThese nations, whilst remaining politically independent and frequently\r\ncoming into hostile contact with each other, all looked to Rome as\r\nthe capital of the Christian world, and to the Pope as the highest\r\nterrestrial authority. Though the Church did not annihilate nationality,\r\nit made a wide breach in the political barriers, and formed a channel\r\nfor international communication by which the social and intellectual\r\nprogress of each nation became known to all the other members of the\r\ngreat Christian confederacy. Throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe Papal Commonwealth educated men had a common language, a common\r\nliterature, a common scientific method, and to a certain extent a common\r\njurisprudence. Western Christendom was thus all through the Middle Ages\r\nnot merely an abstract conception or a geographical expression: if not\r\na political, it was at least a religious and intellectual unit, and all\r\nthe countries of which it was composed benefited more or less by the\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nFor centuries Russia stood outside of this religious and intellectual\r\nconfederation, for her Church connected her not with Rome, but with\r\nConstantinople, and Papal Europe looked upon her as belonging to the\r\nbarbarous East. When the Mongol hosts swept over her plains, burnt her\r\ntowns and villages, and finally incorporated her into the great empire\r\nof Genghis khan, the so-called Christian world took no interest in the\r\nstruggle except in so far as its own safety was threatened. And as\r\ntime wore on, the barriers which separated the two great sections of\r\nChristendom became more and more formidable. The aggressive pretensions\r\nand ambitious schemes of the Vatican produced in the Greek Orthodox\r\nworld a profound antipathy to the Roman Catholic Church and to Western\r\ninfluence of every kind. So strong was this aversion that when the\r\nnations of the West awakened in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\nfrom their intellectual lethargy and began to move forward on the path\r\nof intellectual and material progress, Russia not only remained unmoved,\r\nbut looked on the new civilisation with suspicion and fear as a thing\r\nheretical and accursed. We have here one of the chief reasons why\r\nRussia, at the present day, is in many respects less civilised than the\r\nnations of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely in this negative way that the acceptance of\r\nChristianity from Constantinople has affected the fate of Russia. The\r\nGreek Church, whilst excluding Roman Catholic civilisation, exerted\r\nat the same time a powerful positive influence on the historical\r\ndevelopment of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Church of the West inherited from old Rome something of that\r\nlogical, juridical, administrative spirit which had created the Roman\r\nlaw, and something of that ambition and dogged, energetic perseverance\r\nthat had formed nearly the whole known world into a great centralised\r\nempire. The Bishops of Rome early conceived the design of reconstructing\r\nthat old empire on a new basis, and long strove to create a universal\r\nChristian theocratic State, in which kings and other civil authorities\r\nshould be the subordinates of Christ\u0027s Vicar upon earth. The Eastern\r\nChurch, on the contrary, has remained true to her Byzantine traditions,\r\nand has never dreamed of such lofty pretensions. Accustomed to lean on\r\nthe civil power, she has always been content to play a secondary part,\r\nand has never strenuously resisted the formation of national churches.\r\n\r\nFor about two centuries after the introduction of Christianity--from\r\n988 to 1240--Russia formed, ecclesiastically speaking, part of the\r\nPatriarchate of Constantinople. The metropolitans and the bishops were\r\nGreek by birth and education, and the ecclesiastical administration was\r\nguided and controlled by the Byzantine Patriarchs. But from the time of\r\nthe Mongol invasion, when communication with Constantinople became more\r\ndifficult and educated native priests had become more numerous, this\r\ncomplete dependence on the Patriarch of Constantinople ceased. The\r\nPrinces gradually arrogated to themselves the right of choosing the\r\nMetropolitan of Kief--who was at that time the chief ecclesiastical\r\ndignitary in Russia--and merely sent their nominees to Constantinople\r\nfor consecration. About 1448 this formality came to be dispensed with,\r\nand the Metropolitan was commonly consecrated by a Council of Russian\r\nbishops. A further step in the direction of ecclesiastical autonomy was\r\ntaken in 1589, when the Tsar succeeded in procuring the consecration of\r\na Russian Patriarch, equal in dignity and authority to the Patriarchs of\r\nConstantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria.\r\n\r\nIn all matters of external form the Patriarch of Moscow was a very\r\nimportant personage. He exercised a certain influence in civil as well\r\nas ecclesiastical affairs, bore the official title of \"Great Lord\"\r\n(Veliki Gosudar), which had previously been reserved for the civil head\r\nof the State, and habitually received from the people scarcely less\r\nveneration than the Tsar himself. But in reality he possessed very\r\nlittle independent power. The Tsar was the real ruler in ecclesiastical\r\nas well as in civil affairs.*\r\n\r\n     * As this is frequently denied by Russians, it may be well\r\n     to quote one authority out of many that might be cited.\r\n     Bishop Makarii, whose erudition and good faith are alike\r\n     above suspicion, says of Dmitri of the Don: \"He arrogated to\r\n     himself full, unconditional power over the Head of the\r\n     Russian Church, and through him over the whole Russian\r\n     Church itself.\"  (\"Istoriya Russkoi Tserkvi,\" V., p. 101.)\r\n     This is said of a Grand Prince who had strong rivals and had\r\n     to treat the Church as an ally.  When the Grand Princes\r\n     became Tsars and had no longer any rivals, their power was\r\n     certainly not diminished.  Any further confirmation that may\r\n     be required will be found in the Life of the famous\r\n     Patriarch Nikon.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Patriarchate came to an end in the time of Peter the\r\nGreat. Peter wished, among other things, to reform the ecclesiastical\r\nadministration, and to introduce into his country many novelties which\r\nthe majority of the clergy and of the people regarded as heretical; and\r\nhe clearly perceived that a bigoted, energetic Patriarch might throw\r\nconsiderable obstacles in his way, and cause him infinite annoyance.\r\nThough such a Patriarch might be deposed without any flagrant violation\r\nof the canonical formalities, the operation would necessarily be\r\nattended with great trouble and loss of time. Peter was no friend of\r\nroundabout, tortuous methods, and preferred to remove the difficulty in\r\nhis usual thorough, violent fashion. When the Patriarch Adrian died, the\r\ncustomary short interregnum was prolonged for twenty years, and when\r\nthe people had thus become accustomed to having no Patriarch, it was\r\nannounced that no more Patriarchs would be elected. Their place\r\nwas supplied by an ecclesiastical council, or Synod, in which, as a\r\ncontemporary explained, \"the mainspring was Peter\u0027s power, and the\r\npendulum his understanding.\" The great autocrat justly considered\r\nthat such a council could be much more easily managed than a stubborn\r\nPatriarch, and the wisdom of the measure has been duly appreciated\r\nby succeeding sovereigns. Though the idea of re-establishing the\r\nPatriarchate has more than once been raised, it has never been carried\r\ninto execution. The Holy Synod remains the highest ecclesiastical\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nBut the Emperor? What is his relation to the Synod and to the Church in\r\ngeneral?\r\n\r\nThis is a question about which zealous Orthodox Russians are extremely\r\nsensitive. If a foreigner ventures to hint in their presence that the\r\nEmperor seems to have a considerable influence in the Church, he may\r\ninadvertently produce a little outburst of patriotic warmth and virtuous\r\nindignation. The truth is that many Russians have a pet theory on this\r\nsubject, and have at the same time a dim consciousness that the theory\r\nis not quite in accordance with reality. They hold theoretically that\r\nthe Orthodox Church has no \"Head\" but Christ, and is in some peculiar\r\nundefined sense entirely independent of all terrestrial authority. In\r\nthis respect it is often contrasted with the Anglican Church, much to\r\nthe disadvantage of the latter; and the supposed differences between\r\nthe two are made a theme for semi-religious, semi-patriotic exultation.\r\nKhomiakof, for instance, in one of his most vigorous poems, predicts\r\nthat God will one day take the destiny of the world out of the hands\r\nof England in order to give it to Russia, and he adduces as one of\r\nthe reasons for this transfer the fact that England \"has chained, with\r\nsacrilegious hand, the Church of God to the pedestal of the vain earthly\r\npower.\" So far the theory. As to the facts, it is unquestionable that\r\nthe Tsar exercises a much greater influence in ecclesiastical affairs\r\nthan the King and Parliament in England. All who know the internal\r\nhistory of Russia are aware that the Government does not draw a clear\r\nline of distinction between the temporal and the spiritual, and that\r\nit occasionally uses the ecclesiastical organisation for political\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the relations between Church and State?\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, we must carefully distinguish between the Eastern\r\nOrthodox Church as a whole and that section of it which is known as the\r\nRussian Church.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church* is, properly speaking, a confederation of\r\nindependent churches without any central authority--a unity founded\r\non the possession of a common dogma and on the theoretical but now\r\nunrealisable possibility of holding Ecumenical Councils. The\r\nRussian National Church is one of the members of this ecclesiastical\r\nconfederation. In matters of faith it is bound by the decisions of\r\nthe ancient Ecumenical Councils, but in all other respects it enjoys\r\ncomplete independence and autonomy.\r\n\r\n     * Or Greek Orthodox Church, as it is sometimes called.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the Orthodox Church as a whole the Emperor of Russia is\r\nnothing more than a simple member, and can no more interfere with its\r\ndogmas or ceremonial than a King of Italy or an Emperor of the French\r\ncould modify Roman Catholic theology; but in relation to the Russian\r\nNational Church his position is peculiar. He is described in one of the\r\nfundamental laws as \"the supreme defender and preserver of the dogmas\r\nof the dominant faith,\" and immediately afterwards it is said that \"the\r\nautocratic power acts in the ecclesiastical administration by means\r\nof the most Holy Governing Synod, created by it.\"* This describes very\r\nfairly the relations between the Emperor and the Church. He is merely\r\nthe defender of the dogmas, and cannot in the least modify them; but he\r\nis at the same time the chief administrator, and uses the Synod as an\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n     * Svod Zakonov I., 42, 43.\r\n\r\nSome ingenious people who wish to prove that the creation of the Synod\r\nwas not an innovation represent the institution as a resuscitation of\r\nthe ancient local councils; but this view is utterly untenable. The\r\nSynod is not a council of deputies from various sections of the Church,\r\nbut a permanent college, or ecclesiastical senate, the members of which\r\nare appointed and dismissed by the Emperor as he thinks fit. It has no\r\nindependent legislative authority, for its legislative projects do not\r\nbecome law till they have received the Imperial sanction; and they are\r\nalways published, not in the name of the Church, but in the name of\r\nthe Supreme Power. Even in matters of simple administration it is\r\nnot independent, for all its resolutions require the consent of the\r\nProcureur, a layman nominated by his Majesty. In theory this functionary\r\nprotests only against those resolutions which are not in accordance with\r\nthe civil law of the country; but as he alone has the right to\r\naddress the Emperor directly on ecclesiastical concerns, and as all\r\ncommunications between the Emperor and the Synod pass through his hands,\r\nhe possesses in reality considerable power. Besides this, he can always\r\ninfluence the individual members by holding out prospects of advancement\r\nand decorations, and if this device fails, he can make refractory\r\nmembers retire, and fill up their places with men of more pliant\r\ndisposition. A Council constituted in this way cannot, of course,\r\ndisplay much independence of thought or action, especially in a country\r\nlike Russia, where no one ventures to oppose openly the Imperial will.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that the Russian ecclesiastics regard\r\nthe Imperial authority with jealousy or dislike. They are all most loyal\r\nsubjects, and warm adherents of autocracy. Those ideas of ecclesiastical\r\nindependence which are so common in Western Europe, and that spirit of\r\nopposition to the civil power which animates the Roman Catholic clergy,\r\nare entirely foreign to their minds. If a bishop sometimes complains to\r\nan intimate friend that he has been brought to St. Petersburg and made\r\na member of the Synod merely to append his signature to official papers\r\nand to give his consent to foregone conclusions, his displeasure is\r\ndirected, not against the Emperor, but against the Procureur. He is\r\nfull of loyalty and devotion to the Tsar, and has no desire to see his\r\nMajesty excluded from all influence in ecclesiastical affairs; but he\r\nfeels saddened and humiliated when he finds that the whole government of\r\nthe Church is in the hands of a lay functionary, who may be a military\r\nman, and who looks at all matters from a layman\u0027s point of view.\r\n\r\nThis close connection between Church and State and the thoroughly\r\nnational character of the Russian Church is well illustrated by the\r\nhistory of the local ecclesiastical administration. The civil and the\r\necclesiastical administration have always had the same character and\r\nhave always been modified by the same influences. The terrorism which\r\nwas largely used by the Muscovite Tsars and brought to a climax by Peter\r\nthe Great appeared equally in both. In the episcopal circulars, as in\r\nthe Imperial ukazes, we find frequent mention of \"most cruel corporal\r\npunishment,\" \"cruel punishment with whips, so that the delinquent and\r\nothers may not acquire the habit of practising such insolence,\" and much\r\nmore of the same kind. And these terribly severe measures were sometimes\r\ndirected against very venial offences. The Bishop of Vologda, for\r\ninstance, in 1748 decrees \"cruel corporal punishment\" against priests\r\nwho wear coarse and ragged clothes,* and the records of the Consistorial\r\ncourts contain abundant proof that such decrees were rigorously\r\nexecuted. When Catherine II. introduced a more humane spirit into the\r\ncivil administration, corporal punishment was at once abolished in the\r\nConsistorial courts, and the procedure was modified according to the\r\naccepted maxims of civil jurisprudence. But I must not weary the reader\r\nwith tiresome historical details. Suffice it to say that, from the time\r\nof Peter the Great downwards, the character of all the more energetic\r\nsovereigns is reflected in the history of the ecclesiastical\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n     * Znamenski, \"Prikhodskoe Dukhovenstvo v Rossii so vremeni\r\n     reformy Petra,\" Kazan, 1873.\r\n\r\nEach province, or \"government,\" forms a diocese, and the bishop, like\r\nthe civil governor, has a Council which theoretically controls his\r\npower, but practically has no controlling influence whatever. The\r\nConsistorial Council, which has in the theory of ecclesiastical\r\nprocedure a very imposing appearance, is in reality the bishop\u0027s\r\nchancellerie, and its members are little more than secretaries, whose\r\nchief object is to make themselves agreeable to their superior. And it\r\nmust be confessed that, so long as they remain what they are, the\r\nless power they possess the better it will be for those who have the\r\nmisfortune to be under their jurisdiction. The higher dignitaries have\r\nat least larger aims and a certain consciousness of the dignity of their\r\nposition; but the lower officials, who have no such healthy restraints\r\nand receive ridiculously small salaries, grossly misuse the little\r\nauthority which they possess, and habitually pilfer and extort in the\r\nmost shameless manner. The Consistories are, in fact, what the public\r\noffices were in the time of Nicholas I.\r\n\r\nThe higher ecclesiastical administration has always been in the hands\r\nof the monks, or \"Black Clergy,\" as they are commonly termed, who form a\r\nlarge and influential class. The monks who first settled in Russia were,\r\nlike those who first visited north-western Europe, men of the earnest,\r\nascetic, missionary type. Filled with zeal for the glory of God and the\r\nsalvation of souls, they took little or no thought for the morrow, and\r\ndevoutly believed that their Heavenly Father, without whose knowledge no\r\nsparrow falls to the ground, would provide for their humble wants. Poor,\r\nclad in rags, eating the most simple fare, and ever ready to share what\r\nthey had with any one poorer than themselves, they performed faithfully\r\nand earnestly the work which their Master had given them to do. But\r\nthis ideal of monastic life soon gave way in Russia, as in the West, to\r\npractices less simple and austere. By the liberal donations and bequests\r\nof the faithful the monasteries became rich in gold, in silver, in\r\nprecious stones, and above all in land and serfs. Troitsa, for instance,\r\npossessed at one time 120,000 serfs and a proportionate amount of land,\r\nand it is said that at the beginning of the eighteenth century more than\r\na fourth of the entire population had fallen under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe Church. Many of the monasteries engaged in commerce, and the monks\r\nwere, if we may credit Fletcher, who visited Russia in 1588, the most\r\nintelligent merchants of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the Church lands were secularised, and the\r\nserfs of the Church became serfs of the State. This was a severe\r\nblow for the monasteries, but it did not prove fatal, as many people\r\npredicted. Some monasteries were abolished and others were reduced to\r\nextreme poverty, but many survived and prospered. These could no longer\r\npossess serfs, but they had still three sources of revenue: a limited\r\namount of real property, Government subsidies, and the voluntary\r\nofferings of the faithful. At present there are about 500 monastic\r\nestablishments, and the great majority of them, though not wealthy,\r\nhave revenues more than sufficient to satisfy all the requirements of an\r\nascetic life.\r\n\r\nThus in Russia, as in Western Europe, the history of monastic\r\ninstitutions is composed of three chapters, which may be briefly\r\nentitled: asceticism and missionary enterprise; wealth, luxury, and\r\ncorruption; secularisation of property and decline. But between Eastern\r\nand Western monasticism there is at least one marked difference.\r\nThe monasticism of the West made at various epochs of its history\r\na vigorous, spontaneous effort at self-regeneration, which found\r\nexpression in the foundation of separate Orders, each of which proposed\r\nto itself some special aim--some special sphere of usefulness. In Russia\r\nwe find no similar phenomenon. Here the monasteries never deviated\r\nfrom the rules of St. Basil, which restrict the members to religious\r\nceremonies, prayer, and contemplation. From time to time a solitary\r\nindividual raised his voice against the prevailing abuses, or retired\r\nfrom his monastery to spend the remainder of his days in ascetic\r\nsolitude; but neither in the monastic population as a whole, nor in any\r\nparticular monastery, do we find at any time a spontaneous, vigorous\r\nmovement towards reform. During the last two hundred years reforms have\r\ncertainly been effected, but they have all been the work of the civil\r\npower, and in the realisation of them the monks have shown little more\r\nthan the virtue of resignation. Here, as elsewhere, we have evidence of\r\nthat inertness, apathy, and want of spontaneous vigour which form one of\r\nthe most characteristic traits of Russian national life. In this, as in\r\nother departments of national activity, the spring of action has lain\r\nnot in the people, but in the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to the monks to state that in their dislike to progress\r\nand change of every kind they merely reflect the traditional spirit of\r\nthe Church to which they belong. The Russian Church, like the Eastern\r\nOrthodox Church generally, is essentially conservative. Anything in\r\nthe nature of a religious revival is foreign to her traditions and\r\ncharacter. Quieta non movere is her fundamental principle of conduct.\r\nShe prides herself as being above terrestrial influences.\r\n\r\nThe modifications that have been made in her administrative organisation\r\nhave not affected her inner nature. In spirit and character she is now\r\nwhat she was under the Patriarchs in the time of the Muscovite Tsars,\r\nholding fast to the promise that no jot or tittle shall pass from the\r\nlaw till all be fulfilled. To those who talk about the requirements of\r\nmodern life and modern science she turns a deaf ear. Partly from the\r\npredominance which she gives to the ceremonial element, partly from\r\nthe fact that her chief aim is to preserve unmodified the doctrine and\r\nceremonial as determined by the early Ecumenical Councils, and partly\r\nfrom the low state of general culture among the clergy, she has ever\r\nremained outside of the intellectual movements. The attempts of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church to develop the traditional dogmas by definition\r\nand deduction, and the efforts of Protestants to reconcile their creeds\r\nwith progressive science and the ever-varying intellectual currents of\r\nthe time, are alike foreign to her nature. Hence she has produced no\r\nprofound theological treatises conceived in a philosophical spirit, and\r\nhas made no attempt to combat the spirit of infidelity in its modern\r\nforms. Profoundly convinced that her position is impregnable, she has\r\n\"let the nations rave,\" and scarcely deigned to cast a glance at their\r\nintellectual and religious struggles. In a word, she is \"in the world,\r\nbut not of it.\"\r\n\r\nIf we wish to see represented in a visible form the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the Russian Church, we have only to glance at Russian\r\nreligious art, and compare it with that of Western Europe. In the West,\r\nfrom the time of the Renaissance downwards, religious art has kept pace\r\nwith artistic progress. Gradually it emancipated itself from archaic\r\nforms and childish symbolism, converted the lifeless typical figures\r\ninto living individuals, lit up their dull eyes and expressionless\r\nfaces with human intelligence and human feeling, and finally aimed at\r\narchaeological accuracy in costume and other details. Thus in the\r\nWest the Icon grew slowly into the naturalistic portrait, and the rude\r\nsymbolical groups developed gradually into highly-finished historical\r\npictures. In Russia the history of religious art has been entirely\r\ndifferent. Instead of distinctive schools of painting and great\r\nreligious artists, there has been merely an anonymous traditional craft,\r\ndestitute of any artistic individuality. In all the productions of\r\nthis craft the old Byzantine forms have been faithfully and rigorously\r\npreserved, and we can see reflected in the modern Icons--stiff, archaic,\r\nexpressionless--the immobility of the Eastern Church in general, and of\r\nthe Russian Church in particular.\r\n\r\nTo the Roman Catholic, who struggles against science as soon as it\r\ncontradicts traditional conceptions, and to the Protestant, who strives\r\nto bring his religious beliefs into accordance with his scientific\r\nknowledge, the Russian Church may seem to resemble an antediluvian\r\npetrifaction, or a cumbrous line-of-battle ship that has been long\r\nstranded. It must be confessed, however, that the serene inactivity for\r\nwhich she is distinguished has had very valuable practical consequences.\r\nThe Russian clergy have neither that haughty, aggressive intolerance\r\nwhich characterises their Roman Catholic brethren, nor that bitter,\r\nuncharitable, sectarian spirit which is too often to be found among\r\nProtestants. They allow not only to heretics, but also to members of\r\ntheir own communion, the most complete intellectual freedom, and never\r\nthink of anathematising any one for his scientific or unscientific\r\nopinions. All that they demand is that those who have been born\r\nwithin the pale of Orthodoxy should show the Church a certain nominal\r\nallegiance; and in this matter of allegiance they are by no mean very\r\nexacting. So long as a member refrains from openly attacking the Church\r\nand from going over to another confession, he may entirely neglect all\r\nreligious ordinances and publicly profess scientific theories logically\r\ninconsistent with any kind of dogmatic religious belief without the\r\nslightest danger of incurring ecclesiastical censure.\r\n\r\nThis apathetic tolerance may be partly explained by the national\r\ncharacter, but it is also to some extent due to the peculiar relations\r\nbetween Church and State. The government vigilantly protects the Church\r\nfrom attack, and at the same time prevents her from attacking her\r\nenemies. Hence religious questions are never discussed in the Press,\r\nand the ecclesiastical literature is all historical, homiletic, or\r\ndevotional. The authorities allow public oral discussions to be held\r\nduring Lent in the Kremlin of Moscow between members of the State Church\r\nand Old Ritualists; but these debates are not theological in our sense\r\nof the term. They turn exclusively on details of Church history, and on\r\nthe minutiae of ceremonial observance.\r\n\r\nA few years ago there was a good deal of vague talk about a possible\r\nunion of the Russian and Anglican Churches. If by \"union\" is meant\r\nsimply union in the bonds of brotherly love, there can be, of course, no\r\nobjection to any amount of such pia desideria; but if anything more real\r\nand practical is intended, the project is an absurdity. A real union of\r\nthe Russian and Anglican Churches would be as difficult of realisation,\r\nand is as undesirable, as a union of the Russian Council of State and\r\nthe British House of Commons.*\r\n\r\n     * I suppose that the more serious partisans of the union\r\n     scheme mean union with the Eastern Orthodox, and not with\r\n     the Russian, Church.  To them the above remarks are not\r\n     addressed.  Their scheme is, in my opinion, unrealisable and\r\n     undesirable, but it contains nothing absurd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE NOBLESSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nobles In Early Times--The Mongol Domination--The Tsardom of\r\nMuscovy--Family Dignity--Reforms of Peter the Great--The Nobles Adopt\r\nWest-European Conceptions--Abolition of Obligatory Service--Influence of\r\nCatherine II.--The Russian Dvoryanstvo Compared with the French Noblesse\r\nand the English Aristocracy--Russian Titles--Probable Future of the\r\nRussian Noblesse.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have been compelling the reader to move about among what\r\nwe should call the lower classes--peasants, burghers, traders, parish\r\npriests, Dissenters, heretics, Cossacks, and the like--and he feels\r\nperhaps inclined to complain that he has had no opportunity of mixing\r\nwith what old-fashioned people call gentle-folk and persons of quality.\r\nBy way of making amends to him for this reprehensible conduct on my\r\npart, I propose now to present him to the whole Noblesse* in a body, not\r\nonly those at present living, but also their near and distant ancestors,\r\nright back to the foundation of the Russian Empire a thousand years ago.\r\nThereafter I shall introduce him to some of the country families and\r\ninvite him to make with me a few country-house visits.\r\n\r\n     * I use here a foreign, in preference to an English, term,\r\n     because the word \"Nobility\" would convey a false impression.\r\n     Etymologically the Russian word \"Dvoryanin\" means a Courtier\r\n     (from Dvor\u003dcourt); but this term is equally objectionable,\r\n     because the great majority of the Dvoryanstvo have nothing\r\n     to do with the Court.\r\n\r\nIn the old times, when Russia was merely a collection of some seventy\r\nindependent principalities, each reigning prince was surrounded by\r\na group of armed men, composed partly of Boyars, or large landed\r\nproprietors, and partly of knights, or soldiers of fortune. These men,\r\nwho formed the Noblesse of the time, were to a certain extent under the\r\nauthority of the Prince, but they were by no means mere obedient, silent\r\nexecutors of his will. The Boyars might refuse to take part in his\r\nmilitary expeditions, and the \"free-lances\" might leave his service\r\nand seek employment elsewhere. If he wished to go to war without their\r\nconsent, they could say to him, as they did on one occasion, \"You have\r\nplanned this yourself, Prince, so we will not go with you, for we knew\r\nnothing of it.\" Nor was this resistance to the princely will always\r\nmerely passive. Once, in the principality of Galitch, the armed men\r\nseized their prince, killed his favourites, burned his mistress, and\r\nmade him swear that he would in future live with his lawful wife. To his\r\nsuccessor, who had married the wife of a priest, they spoke thus: \"We\r\nhave not risen against YOU, Prince, but we will not do reverence to a\r\npriest\u0027s wife: we will put her to death, and then you may marry whom you\r\nplease.\" Even the energetic Bogolubski, one of the most remarkable\r\nof the old Princes, did not succeed in having his own way. When he\r\nattempted to force the Boyars he met with stubborn opposition, and was\r\nfinally assassinated. From these incidents, which might be indefinitely\r\nmultiplied from the old chronicles, we see that in the early period\r\nof Russian history the Boyars and knights were a body of free men,\r\npossessing a considerable amount of political power.\r\n\r\nUnder the Mongol domination this political equilibrium was destroyed.\r\nWhen the country had been conquered, the Princes became servile vassals\r\nof the Khan and arbitrary rulers towards their own subjects. The\r\npolitical significance of the nobles was thereby greatly diminished. It\r\nwas not, however, by any means annihilated. Though the Prince no longer\r\ndepended entirely on their support, he had an interest in retaining\r\ntheir services, to protect his territory in case of sudden attack, or\r\nto increase his possessions at the expense of his neighbours when a\r\nconvenient opportunity presented itself. Theoretically, such conquests\r\nwere impossible, for all removing of the ancient landmarks depended on\r\nthe decision of the Khan; but in reality the Khan paid little attention\r\nto the affairs of his vassals so long as the tribute was regularly\r\npaid; and much took place in Russia without his permission. We find,\r\ntherefore, in some of the principalities the old relations still\r\nsubsisting under Mongol rule. The famous Dmitri of the Don, for\r\ninstance, when on his death-bed, speaks thus to his Boyars: \"You know\r\nmy habits and my character; I was born among you, grew up among you,\r\ngoverned with you--fighting by your side, showing you honour and love,\r\nand placing you over towns and districts. I loved your children, and\r\ndid evil to no one. I rejoiced with you in your joy, mourned with you in\r\nyour grief, and called you the princes of my land.\" Then, turning to his\r\nchildren, he adds, as a parting advice: \"Love your Boyars, my children;\r\nshow them the honour which their services merit, and undertake nothing\r\nwithout their consent.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Grand Princes of Moscow brought the other principalities under\r\ntheir power, and formed them into the Tsardom of Muscovy, the nobles\r\ndescended another step in the political scale. So long as there were\r\nmany principalities they could quit the service of a Prince as soon as\r\nhe gave them reason to be discontented, knowing that they would be well\r\nreceived by one of his rivals; but now they had no longer any choice.\r\nThe only rival of Moscow was Lithuania, and precautions were taken to\r\nprevent the discontented from crossing the Lithuanian frontier. The\r\nnobles were no longer voluntary adherents of a Prince, but had become\r\nsubjects of a Tsar; and the Tsars were not as the old Princes had\r\nbeen. By a violent legal fiction they conceived themselves to be\r\nthe successors of the Byzantine Emperors, and created a new court\r\nceremonial, borrowed partly from Constantinople and partly from the\r\nMongol Horde. They no longer associated familiarly with the Boyars, and\r\nno longer asked their advice, but treated them rather as menials.\r\nWhen the nobles entered their august master\u0027s presence they prostrated\r\nthemselves in Oriental fashion--occasionally as many as thirty\r\ntimes--and when they incurred his displeasure they were summarily\r\nflogged or executed, according to the Tsar\u0027s good pleasure. In\r\nsucceeding to the power of the Khans, the Tsars had adopted, we see, a\r\ngood deal of the Mongol system of government.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that a class of men which had formerly shown a proud\r\nspirit of independence should have submitted quietly to such humiliation\r\nand oppression without making a serious effort to curb the new power,\r\nwhich had no longer a Tartar Horde at its back to quell opposition. But\r\nwe must remember that the nobles, as well as the Princes, had passed in\r\nthe meantime through the school of the Mongol domination. In the course\r\nof two centuries they had gradually become accustomed to despotic rule\r\nin the Oriental sense. If they felt their position humiliating and\r\nirksome, they must have felt, too, how difficult it was to better it.\r\nTheir only resource lay in combining against the common oppressor;\r\nand we have only to glance at the motley, disorganised group, as they\r\ncluster round the Tsar, to perceive that combination was extremely\r\ndifficult. We can distinguish there the mediatised Princes, still\r\nharbouring designs for the recovery of their independence; the Moscow\r\nBoyars, jealous of their family honour and proud of Muscovite supremacy;\r\nTartar Murzi, who have submitted to be baptised and have received land\r\nlike the other nobles; the Novgorodian magnate, who cannot forget the\r\nancient glory of his native city; Lithuanian nobles, who find it more\r\nprofitable to serve the Tsar than their own sovereign; petty chiefs who\r\nhave fled from the opposition of the Teutonic order; and soldiers of\r\nfortune from every part of Russia. Strong, permanent political factors\r\nare not easily formed out of such heterogeneous material.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sixteenth century the old dynasty became extinct,\r\nand after a short period of political anarchy, commonly called \"the\r\ntroublous times\" (smutnoe vremya), the Romanof family were raised to the\r\nthrone by the will of the people, or at least by those who were assumed\r\nto be its representatives. By this change the Noblesse acquired a\r\nsomewhat better position. They were no longer exposed to capricious\r\ntyranny and barbarous cruelty, such as they had experienced at the hands\r\nof Ivan the Terrible, but they did not, as a class, gain any political\r\ninfluence. There were still rival families and rival factions, but\r\nthere were no political parties in the proper sense of the term, and the\r\nhighest aim of families and factions was to gain the favour of the Tsar.\r\n\r\nThe frequent quarrels about precedence which took place among the rival\r\nfamilies at this period form one of the most curious episodes of Russian\r\nhistory. The old patriarchal conception of the family as a unit, one and\r\nindivisible, was still so strong among these men that the elevation or\r\ndegradation of one member of a family was considered to affect deeply\r\nthe honour of all the other members. Each noble family had its rank in a\r\nrecognised scale of dignity, according to the rank which it held, or had\r\npreviously held, in the Tsar\u0027s service; and a whole family would have\r\nconsidered itself dishonoured if one of its members accepted a post\r\nlower than that to which he was entitled. Whenever a vacant place in\r\nthe service was filled up, the subordinates of the successful candidate\r\nexamined the official records and the genealogical trees of their\r\nfamilies, in order to discover whether some ancestor of their new\r\nsuperior had not served under one of their own ancestors. If the\r\nsubordinate found such a case, he complained to the Tsar that it was not\r\nbecoming for him to serve under a man who had less family honour than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nUnfounded complaints of this kind often entailed imprisonment or\r\ncorporal punishment, but in spite of this the quarrels for precedence\r\nwere very frequent. At the commencement of a campaign many such disputes\r\nwere sure to arise, and the Tsar\u0027s decision was not always accepted by\r\nthe party who considered himself aggrieved. I have met at least with one\r\nexample of a great dignitary voluntarily mutilating his hand in order\r\nto escape the necessity of serving under a man whom he considered his\r\ninferior in family dignity. Even at the Tsar\u0027s table these rivalries\r\nsometimes produced unseemly incidents, for it was almost impossible\r\nto arrange the places so as to satisfy all the guests. In one recorded\r\ninstance a noble who received a place lower than that to which he\r\nconsidered himself entitled openly declared to the Tsar that he would\r\nrather be condemned to death than submit to such an indignity. In\r\nanother instance of a similar kind the refractory guest was put on his\r\nchair by force, but saved his family honour by slipping under the table!\r\n\r\nThe next transformation of the Noblesse was effected by Peter the\r\nGreat. Peter was by nature and position an autocrat, and could brook no\r\nopposition. Having set before himself a great aim, he sought everywhere\r\nobedient, intelligent, energetic instruments to carry out his designs.\r\nHe himself served the State zealously--as a common artisan, when he\r\nconsidered it necessary--and he insisted on all his subjects doing\r\nlikewise, under pain of merciless punishment. To noble birth and long\r\npedigrees he habitually showed a most democratic, or rather autocratic,\r\nindifference. Intent on obtaining the service of living men, he paid no\r\nattention to the claims of dead ancestors, and gave to his servants the\r\npay and honour which their services merited, irrespectively of birth or\r\nsocial position. Hence many of his chief coadjutors had no connection\r\nwith the old Russian families. Count Yaguzhinski, who long held one of\r\nthe most important posts in the State, was the son of a poor sacristan;\r\nCount Devier was a Portuguese by birth, and had been a cabin-boy; Baron\r\nShafirof was a Jew; Hannibal, who died with the rank of Commander in\r\nChief, was a negro who had been bought in Constantinople; and his Serene\r\nHighness Prince Menshikof had begun life, it was said, as a baker\u0027s\r\napprentice! For the future, noble birth was to count for nothing. The\r\nservice of the State was thrown open to men of all ranks, and personal\r\nmerit was to be the only claim to promotion.\r\n\r\nThis must have seemed to the Conservatives of the time a most\r\nrevolutionary and reprehensible proceeding, but it did not satisfy the\r\nreforming tendencies of the great autocrat. He went a step further, and\r\nentirely changed the legal status of the Noblesse. Down to his time the\r\nnobles were free to serve or not as they chose, and those who chose to\r\nserve enjoyed land on what we should call a feudal tenure. Some served\r\npermanently in the military or civil administration, but by far the\r\ngreater number lived on their estates, and entered the active service\r\nmerely when the militia was called out in view of war. This system was\r\ncompletely changed when Peter created a large standing army and a\r\ngreat centralised bureaucracy. By one of those \"fell swoops\" which\r\nperiodically occur in Russian history, he changed the feudal into\r\nfreehold tenures, and laid down the principle that all nobles, whatever\r\ntheir landed possessions might be, should serve the State in the army,\r\nthe fleet, or the civil administration, from boyhood to old age. In\r\naccordance with this principle, any noble who refused to serve was not\r\nonly deprived of his estate, as in the old times, but was declared to be\r\na traitor and might be condemned to capital punishment.\r\n\r\nThe nobles were thus transformed into servants of the State, and the\r\nState in the time of Peter was a hard taskmaster. They complained\r\nbitterly, and with reason, that they had been deprived of their ancient\r\nrights, and were compelled to accept quietly and uncomplainingly\r\nwhatever burdens their master chose to place upon them. \"Though our\r\ncountry,\" they said, \"is in no danger of invasion, no sooner is peace\r\nconcluded than plans are laid for a new war, which has generally no\r\nother foundation than the ambition of the Sovereign, or perhaps merely\r\nthe ambition of one of his Ministers. To please him our peasants are\r\nutterly exhausted, and we ourselves are forced to leave our homes and\r\nfamilies, not as formerly for a single campaign, but for long years. We\r\nare compelled to contract debts and to entrust our estates to thieving\r\noverseers, who commonly reduce them to such a condition that when we\r\nare allowed to retire from the service, in consequence of old age or\r\nillness, we cannot to the end of our lives retrieve our prosperity. In\r\na word, we are so exhausted and ruined by the keeping up of a standing\r\narmy, and by the consequences flowing therefrom, that the most cruel\r\nenemy, though he should devastate the whole Empire, could not cause us\r\none-half of the injury.\"*\r\n\r\n     * These complaints have been preserved by Vockerodt, a\r\n     Prussian diplomatic agent of the time.\r\n\r\nThis Spartan regime, which ruthlessly sacrificed private interests to\r\nconsiderations of State policy, could not long be maintained in its\r\npristine severity. It undermined its own foundations by demanding too\r\nmuch. Draconian laws threatening confiscation and capital punishment\r\nwere of little avail. Nobles became monks, inscribed themselves as\r\nmerchants, or engaged themselves as domestic servants, in order to\r\nescape their obligations. \"Some,\" says a contemporary, \"grow old in\r\ndisobedience and have never once appeared in active service. . . . There\r\nis, for instance, Theodore Mokeyef. . . . In spite of the strict orders\r\nsent regarding him no one could ever catch him. Some of those sent\r\nto take him he belaboured with blows, and when he could not beat the\r\nmessengers, he pretended to be dangerously ill, or feigned idiocy, and,\r\nrunning into the pond, stood in the water up to his neck; but as soon\r\nas the messengers were out of sight he returned home and roared like a\r\nlion.\" *\r\n\r\n     * Pososhkof, \"O skudosti i bogatstve.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Peter\u0027s death the system was gradually relaxed, but the Noblesse\r\ncould not be satisfied by partial concessions. Russia had in the\r\nmeantime moved, as it were, out of Asia into Europe, and had become\r\none of the great European Powers. The upper classes had been gradually\r\nlearning something of the fashions, the literature, the institutions,\r\nand the moral conceptions of Western Europe, and the nobles naturally\r\ncompared the class to which they belonged with the aristocracies of\r\nGermany and France. For those who were influenced by the new foreign\r\nideas the comparison was humiliating. In the West the Noblesse was a\r\nfree and privileged class, proud of its liberty, its rights, and its\r\nculture; whereas in Russia the nobles were servants of the State,\r\nwithout privileges, without dignity, subject to corporal punishment, and\r\nburdened with onerous duties from which there was no escape. Thus arose\r\nin that section of the Noblesse which had some acquaintance with Western\r\ncivilisation a feeling of discontent, and a desire to gain a social\r\nposition similar to that of the nobles in France and Germany. These\r\naspirations were in part realised by Peter III., who in 1762 abolished\r\nthe principle of obligatory service. His consort, Catherine II., went\r\nmuch farther in the same direction, and inaugurated a new epoch in the\r\nhistory of the Dvoryanstvo, a period in which its duties and obligations\r\nfell into the background, and its rights and privileges came to the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nCatherine had good reason to favour the Noblesse. As a foreigner and\r\na usurper, raised to the throne by a Court conspiracy, she could not\r\nawaken in the masses that semi-religious veneration which the legitimate\r\nTsars have always enjoyed, and consequently she had to seek support\r\nin the upper classes, who were less rigid and uncompromising in their\r\nconceptions of legitimacy. She confirmed, therefore, the ukaz which\r\nabolished obligatory service of the nobles, and sought to gain their\r\nvoluntary service by honours and rewards. In her manifestoes she always\r\nspoke of them in the most flattering terms; and tried to convince them\r\nthat the welfare of the country depended on their loyalty and devotion.\r\nThough she had no intention of ceding any of her political power, she\r\nformed the nobles of each province into a corporation, with periodical\r\nassemblies, which were supposed to resemble the French Provincial\r\nParliaments, and entrusted to each of these corporations a large part\r\nof the local administration. By these and similar means, aided by her\r\nmasculine energy and feminine tact, she made herself very popular,\r\nand completely changed the old conceptions about the public service.\r\nFormerly service had been looked on as a burden; now it came to be\r\nlooked on as a privilege. Thousands who had retired to their estates\r\nafter the publication of the liberation edict now flocked back and\r\nsought appointments, and this tendency was greatly increased by the\r\nbrilliant campaigns against the Turks, which excited the patriotic\r\nfeelings and gave plentiful opportunities of promotion. \"Not only landed\r\nproprietors,\" it is said in a comedy of the time,* \"but all men, even\r\nshopkeepers and cobblers, aim at becoming officers, and the man who\r\nhas passed his whole life without official rank seems to be not a human\r\nbeing.\"\r\n\r\n     * Knyazhnina, \"Khvastun.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Catherine did more than this. She shared the idea--generally\r\naccepted throughout Europe since the brilliant reign of Louis XIV.--that\r\na refined, pomp-loving, pleasure-seeking Court Noblesse was not only the\r\nbest bulwark of Monarchy, but also a necessary ornament of every highly\r\ncivilised State; and as she ardently desired that her country should\r\nhave the reputation of being highly civilised, she strove to create\r\nthis national ornament. The love of French civilisation, which already\r\nexisted among the upper classes of her subjects, here came to her aid,\r\nand her efforts in this direction were singularly successful. The\r\nCourt of St. Petersburg became almost as brilliant, as galant, and as\r\nfrivolous as the Court of Versailles. All who aimed at high honours\r\nadopted French fashions, spoke the French language, and affected an\r\nunqualified admiration for French classical literature. The Courtiers\r\ntalked of the point d\u0027honneur, discussed the question as to what\r\nwas consistent with the dignity of a noble, sought to display \"that\r\nchivalrous spirit which constitutes the pride and ornament of France\";\r\nand looked back with horror on the humiliating position of their fathers\r\nand grandfathers. \"Peter the Great,\" writes one of them, \"beat all who\r\nsurrounded him, without distinction of family or rank; but now, many of\r\nus would certainly prefer capital punishment to being beaten or flogged,\r\neven though the castigation were applied by the sacred hands of the\r\nLord\u0027s Anointed.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone which reigned in the Court circle of St. Petersburg spread\r\ngradually towards the lower ranks of the Dvoryanstvo, and it seemed to\r\nsuperficial observers that a very fair imitation of the French Noblesse\r\nhad been produced; but in reality the copy was very unlike the model.\r\nThe Russian Dvoryanin easily learned the language and assumed the\r\nmanners of the French gentilhomme, and succeeded in changing his\r\nphysical and intellectual exterior; but all those deeper and more\r\ndelicate parts of human nature which are formed by the accumulated\r\nexperience of past generations could not be so easily and rapidly\r\nchanged. The French gentilhomme of the eighteenth century was the direct\r\ndescendant of the feudal baron, with the fundamental conceptions of his\r\nancestors deeply embedded in his nature. He had not, indeed, the old\r\nhaughty bearing towards the Sovereign, and his language was tinged with\r\nthe fashionable democratic philosophy of the time; but he possessed\r\na large intellectual and moral inheritance that had come down to him\r\ndirectly from the palmy days of feudalism--an inheritance which even the\r\nGreat Revolution, which was then preparing, could not annihilate. The\r\nRussian noble, on the contrary, had received from his ancestors entirely\r\ndifferent traditions. His father and grandfather had been conscious\r\nof the burdens rather than the privileges of the class to which they\r\nbelonged. They had considered it no disgrace to receive corporal\r\npunishment, and had been jealous of their honour, not as gentlemen or\r\ndescendants of Boyars, but as Brigadiers, College Assessors, or Privy\r\nCounsellors. Their dignity had rested not on the grace of God, but\r\non the will of the Tsar. Under these circumstances even the proudest\r\nmagnate of Catherine\u0027s Court, though he might speak French as fluently\r\nas his mother tongue, could not be very deeply penetrated with the\r\nconception of noble blood, the sacred character of nobility, and the\r\nnumerous feudal ideas interwoven with these conceptions. And in adopting\r\nthe outward forms of a foreign culture the nobles did not, it seems,\r\ngain much in true dignity. \"The old pride of the nobles has fallen!\"\r\nexclaims one who had more genuine aristocratic feeling than his\r\nfellows.* \"There are no longer any honourable families; but merely\r\nofficial rank and personal merits. All seek official rank, and as all\r\ncannot render direct services, distinctions are sought by every possible\r\nmeans--by flattering the Monarch and toadying the important personages.\"\r\nThere was considerable truth in this complaint, but the voice of this\r\nsolitary aristocrat was as of one crying in the wilderness. The whole of\r\nthe educated classes--men of old family and parvenus alike--were, with\r\nfew exceptions, too much engrossed with place-hunting to attend to such\r\nsentimental wailing.\r\n\r\n     * Prince Shtcherbatof.\r\n\r\nIf the Russian Noblesse was thus in its new form but a very imperfect\r\nimitation of its French model, it was still more unlike the English\r\naristocracy. Notwithstanding the liberal phrases in which Catherine\r\nhabitually indulged, she never had the least intention of ceding one\r\njot or tittle of her autocratic power, and the Noblesse as a class\r\nnever obtained even a shadow of political influence. There was no real\r\nindependence under the new airs of dignity and hauteur. In all their\r\nacts and openly expressed opinions the courtiers were guided by the\r\nreal or supposed wishes of the Sovereign, and much of their political\r\nsagacity was employed in endeavouring to discover what would please\r\nher. \"People never talk politics in the salons,\" says a contemporary\r\nwitness,* \"not even to praise the Government. Fear has produced habits of\r\nprudence, and the Frondeurs of the Capital express their opinions only\r\nin the confidence of intimate friendship or in a relationship still more\r\nconfidential. Those who cannot bear this constraint retire to Moscow,\r\nwhich cannot be called the centre of opposition, for there is no such\r\nthing as opposition in a country with an autocratic Government, but\r\nwhich is the capital of the discontented.\" And even there the discontent\r\ndid not venture to show itself in the Imperial presence. \"In Moscow,\"\r\nsays another witness, accustomed to the obsequiousness of Versailles,\r\n\"you might believe yourself to be among republicans who have just thrown\r\noff the yoke of a tyrant, but as soon as the Court arrives you see\r\nnothing but abject slaves.\"**\r\n\r\n     * Segur, long Ambassador of France at the Court of\r\n     Catherine.\r\n\r\n     ** Sabathier de Cabres, \"Catherine II. et la Cour de Russie\r\n     en 1772.\"\r\n\r\nThough thus excluded from direct influence in political affairs the\r\nNoblesse might still have acquired a certain political significance in\r\nthe State, by means of the Provincial Assemblies, and by the part\r\nthey took in local administration; but in reality they had neither the\r\nrequisite political experience nor the requisite patience, nor even\r\nthe desire to pursue such a policy. The majority of the proprietors\r\npreferred the chances of promotion in the Imperial service to the\r\ntranquil life of a country gentleman; and those who resided permanently\r\non their estates showed indifference or positive antipathy to everything\r\nconnected with the local administration. What was officially described\r\nas \"a privilege conferred on the nobles for their fidelity, and for\r\nthe generous sacrifice of their lives in their country\u0027s cause,\" was\r\nregarded by those who enjoyed it as a new kind of obligatory service--an\r\nobligation to supply judges and officers of rural police.\r\n\r\nIf we require any additional proof that the nobles amidst all these\r\nchanges were still as dependent as ever on the arbitrary will or caprice\r\nof the Monarch, we have only to glance at their position in the time\r\nof Paul I., the capricious, eccentric, violent son and successor of\r\nCatherine. The autobiographical memoirs of the time depict in vivid\r\ncolours the humiliating position of even the leading men in the State,\r\nin constant fear of exciting by act, word, or look the wrath of the\r\nSovereign. As we read these contemporary records we seem to have before\r\nus a picture of ancient Rome under the most despotic and capricious\r\nof her Emperors. Irritated and embittered before his accession to the\r\nthrone by the haughty demeanour of his mother\u0027s favourites, Paul lost no\r\nopportunity of showing his contempt for aristocratic pretensions, and\r\nof humiliating those who were supposed to harbour them. \"Apprenez,\r\nMonsieur,\" he said angrily on one occasion to Dumouriez, who had\r\naccidentally referred to one of the \"considerable\" personages of the\r\nCourt, \"Apprenez qu\u0027il n\u0027y a pas de considerable ici, que la personne a\r\nlaquelle je parle et pendant le temps que je lui parle!\"*\r\n\r\n     * This saying is often falsely attributed to Nicholas.  The\r\n     anecdote is related by Segur.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Catherine down to the accession of Alexander II. in\r\n1855 no important change was made in the legal status of the Noblesse,\r\nbut a gradual change took place in its social character by the continual\r\ninflux of Western ideas and Western culture. The exclusively French\r\nculture in vogue at the Court of Catherine assumed a more cosmopolitan\r\ncolouring, and permeated downwards till all who had any pretensions to\r\nbeing civilises spoke French with tolerable fluency and possessed at\r\nleast a superficial acquaintance with the literature of Western Europe.\r\nWhat chiefly distinguished them in the eye of the law from the other\r\nclasses was the privilege of possessing \"inhabited estates\"--that is to\r\nsay, estates with serfs. By the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 this\r\nvaluable privilege was abolished, and about one-half of their landed\r\nproperty passed into the hands of the peasantry. By the administrative\r\nreforms which have since taken place, any little significance which the\r\nprovincial corporations may have possessed has been annihilated. Thus\r\nat the present day the nobles are on a level with the other classes with\r\nregard to the right of possessing landed property and the administration\r\nof local affairs.\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid sketch the reader will easily perceive that the Russian\r\nNoblesse has had a peculiar historical development. In Germany, France,\r\nand England the nobles were early formed into a homogeneous organised\r\nbody by the political conditions in which they were placed. They had to\r\nrepel the encroaching tendencies of the Monarchy on the one hand, and\r\nof the bourgeoisie on the other; and in this long struggle with powerful\r\nrivals they instinctively held together and developed a vigorous esprit\r\nde corps. New members penetrated into their ranks, but these intruders\r\nwere so few in number that they were rapidly assimilated without\r\nmodifying the general character or recognised ideals of the class, and\r\nwithout rudely disturbing the fiction of purity of blood. The class thus\r\nassumed more and more the nature of a caste with a peculiar intellectual\r\nand moral culture, and stoutly defended its position and privileges\r\ntill the ever-increasing power of the middle classes undermined its\r\ninfluence. Its fate in different countries has been different. In\r\nGermany it clung to its feudal traditions, and still preserves its\r\nsocial exclusiveness. In France it was deprived of its political\r\ninfluence by the Monarchy and crushed by the Revolution. In England\r\nit moderated its pretensions, allied itself with the middle classes,\r\ncreated under the disguise of constitutional monarchy an aristocratic\r\nrepublic, and conceded inch by inch, as necessity demanded, a share of\r\nits political influence to the ally that had helped it to curb the Royal\r\npower. Thus the German baron, the French gentilhomme, and the English\r\nnobleman represent three distinct, well-marked types; but amidst all\r\ntheir diversities they have much in common. They have all preserved to\r\na greater or less extent a haughty consciousness of innate\r\ninextinguishable superiority over the lower orders, together with a more\r\nor less carefully disguised dislike for the class which has been, and\r\nstill is, an aggressive rival.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Noblesse has not these characteristics. It was formed out of\r\nmore heterogeneous materials, and these materials did not spontaneously\r\ncombine to form an organic whole, but were crushed into a conglomerate\r\nmass by the weight of the autocratic power. It never became a\r\nsemi-independent factor in the State. What rights and privileges it\r\npossesses it received from the Monarchy, and consequently it has no\r\ndeep-rooted jealousy or hatred of the Imperial prerogative. On the other\r\nhand, it has never had to struggle with the other social classes, and\r\ntherefore it harbours towards them no feelings of rivalry or hostility.\r\nIf we hear a Russian noble speak with indignation of autocracy or with\r\nacrimony of the bourgeoisie, we may be sure that these feelings have\r\ntheir source, not in traditional conceptions, but in principles learned\r\nfrom the modern schools of social and political philosophy. The class\r\nto which he belongs has undergone so many transformations that it has no\r\nhoary traditions or deep-rooted prejudices, and always willingly adapts\r\nitself to existing conditions. Indeed, it may be said in general that it\r\nlooks more to the future than the past, and is ever ready to accept any\r\nnew ideas that wear the badge of progress. Its freedom from traditions\r\nand prejudices makes it singularly susceptible of generous enthusiasm\r\nand capable of vigorous spasmodic action, but calm moral courage and\r\ntenacity of purpose are not among its prominent attributes. In a word,\r\nwe find in it neither the peculiar virtues nor the peculiar vices which\r\nare engendered and fostered by an atmosphere of political liberty.\r\n\r\nHowever we may explain the fact, there is no doubt that the\r\nRussian Noblesse has little or nothing of what we call aristocratic\r\nfeeling--little or nothing of that haughty, domineering, exclusive\r\nspirit which we are accustomed to associate with the word aristocracy.\r\nWe find plenty of Russians who are proud of their wealth, of their\r\nculture, or of their official position, but we rarely find a Russian\r\nwho is proud of his birth or imagines that the fact of his having a\r\nlong pedigree gives him any right to political privileges or social\r\nconsideration. Hence there is a certain amount of truth in the\r\noft-repeated saying that there is in reality no aristocracy in Russia.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Noblesse as a whole cannot be called an aristocracy. If\r\nthe term is to be used at all, it must be applied to a group of families\r\nwhich cluster around the Court and form the highest ranks of the\r\nNoblesse. This social aristocracy contains many old families, but its\r\nreal basis is official rank and general culture rather than pedigree or\r\nblood. The feudal conceptions of noble birth, good family, and the like\r\nhave been adopted by some of its members, but do not form one of\r\nits conspicuous features. Though habitually practising a certain\r\nexclusiveness, it has none of those characteristics of a caste which\r\nwe find in the German Adel, and is utterly unable to understand such\r\ninstitutions as Tafelfähigkeit, by which a man who has not a pedigree of\r\na certain length is considered unworthy to sit down at a royal table.\r\nIt takes rather the English aristocracy as its model, and harbours the\r\nsecret hope of one day obtaining a social and political position similar\r\nto that of the nobility and gentry of England. Though it has no peculiar\r\nlegal privileges, its actual position in the Administration and at\r\nCourt gives its members great facilities for advancement in the public\r\nservice. On the other hand, its semi-bureaucratic character, together\r\nwith the law and custom of dividing landed property among the children\r\nat the death of their parents, deprives it of stability. New men force\r\ntheir way into it by official distinction, whilst many of the old\r\nfamilies are compelled by poverty to retire from its ranks. The son of\r\na small proprietor, or even of a parish priest, may rise to the highest\r\noffices of State, whilst the descendants of the half-mythical Rurik may\r\ndescend to the position of peasants. It is said that not very long ago\r\na certain Prince Krapotkin gained his living as a cabman in St.\r\nPetersburg!\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that this social aristocracy must not be confounded\r\nwith the titled families. Titles do not possess the same value in Russia\r\nas in Western Europe. They are very common--because the titled families\r\nare numerous, and all the children bear the titles of the parents even\r\nwhile the parents are still alive--and they are by no means always\r\nassociated with official rank, wealth, social position, or distinction\r\nof any kind. There are hundreds of princes and princesses who have not\r\nthe right to appear at Court, and who would not be admitted into what is\r\ncalled in St. Petersburg la societe, or indeed into refined society in\r\nany country.\r\n\r\nThe only genuine Russian title is Knyaz, commonly translated \"Prince.\"\r\nIt is borne by the descendants of Rurik, of the Lithuanian Prince\r\nGhedimin, and of the Tartar Khans and Murzi officially recognised by the\r\nTsars. Besides these, there are fourteen families who have adopted it by\r\nImperial command during the last two centuries. The titles of count\r\nand baron are modern importations, beginning with the time of Peter\r\nthe Great. From Peter and his successors about seventy families have\r\nreceived the title of count and ten that of baron. The latter are all,\r\nwith two exceptions, of foreign extraction, and are mostly descended\r\nfrom Court bankers.*\r\n\r\n     * Besides these, there are of course the German counts and\r\n     barons of the Baltic Provinces, who are Russian subjects.\r\n\r\nThere is a very common idea that Russian nobles are as a rule enormously\r\nrich. This is a mistake. The majority of them are poor. At the time of\r\nthe Emancipation, in 1861, there were 100,247 landed proprietors, and\r\nof these, more than 41,000 were possessors of less than twenty-one male\r\nserfs--that is to say, were in a condition of poverty. A proprietor who\r\nwas owner of 500 serfs was not considered as by any means very rich, and\r\nyet there were only 3,803 proprietors belonging in that category. There\r\nwere a few, indeed, whose possessions were enormous. Count Sheremetief,\r\nfor instance, possessed more than 150,000 male serfs, or in other words\r\nmore than 300,000 souls; and thirty years ago Count Orloff-Davydof\r\nowned considerably more than half a million of acres. The Demidof family\r\nderive colossal revenues from their mines, and the Strogonofs have\r\nestates which, if put together, would be sufficient in extent to form a\r\ngood-sized independent State in Western Europe. The very rich families,\r\nhowever, are not numerous. The lavish expenditure in which Russian\r\nnobles often indulge indicates too frequently not large fortune, but\r\nsimply foolish ostentation and reckless improvidence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after having spoken so much about the past history of the\r\nNoblesse, I ought to endeavour to cast its horoscope, or at least to\r\nsay something of its probable future. Though predictions are always\r\nhazardous, it is sometimes possible, by tracing the great lines of\r\nhistory in the past, to follow them for a little distance into the\r\nfuture. If it be allowable to apply this method of prediction in\r\nthe present matter, I should say that the Russian Dvoryanstvo will\r\nassimilate with the other classes, rather than form itself into an\r\nexclusive corporation. Hereditary aristocracies may be preserved--or at\r\nleast their decomposition may be retarded--where they happen to exist,\r\nbut it seems that they can no longer be created. In Western Europe there\r\nis a large amount of aristocratic sentiment, both in the nobles and in\r\nthe people; but it exists in spite of, rather than in consequence of,\r\nactual social conditions. It is not a product of modern society, but an\r\nheirloom that has come down to us from feudal times, when power, wealth,\r\nand culture were in the hands of a privileged few. If there ever was in\r\nRussia a period corresponding to the feudal times in Western Europe,\r\nit has long since been forgotten. There is very little aristocratic\r\nsentiment either in the people or in the nobles, and it is difficult to\r\nimagine any source from which it could now be derived. More than this,\r\nthe nobles do not desire to make such an acquisition. In so far as\r\nthey have any political aspirations, they aim at securing the political\r\nliberty of the people as a whole, and not at acquiring exclusive rights\r\nand privileges for their own class.\r\n\r\nIn that section which I have called a social aristocracy there are a\r\nfew individuals who desire to gain exclusive political influence for\r\nthe class to which they belong, but there is very little chance of their\r\nsucceeding. If their desires were ever by chance realised, we should\r\nprobably have a repetition of the scene which occurred in 1730. When in\r\nthat year some of the great families raised the Duchess of Courland to\r\nthe throne on condition of her ceding part of her power to a supreme\r\ncouncil, the lower ranks of the Noblesse compelled her to tear up the\r\nconstitution which she had signed! Those who dislike the autocratic\r\npower dislike the idea of an aristocratic oligarchy infinitely more.\r\nNobles and people alike seem to hold instinctively the creed of the\r\nFrench philosopher, who thought it better to be governed by a lion of\r\ngood family than by a hundred rats of his own species.\r\n\r\nOf the present condition of the Noblesse I shall again have occasion to\r\nspeak when I come to consider the consequences of the Emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nLANDED PROPRIETORS OF THE OLD SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nRussian Hospitality--A Country-House--Its Owner Described--His Life,\r\nPast and Present--Winter Evenings--Books---Connection with the Outer\r\nWorld--The Crimean War and the Emancipation--A Drunken, Dissolute\r\nProprietor--An Old General and his Wife--\"Name Days\"--A Legendary\r\nMonster--A Retired Judge--A Clever Scribe--Social Leniency--Cause of\r\nDemoralisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the foreign countries in which I have travelled, Russia certainly\r\nbears off the palm in the matter of hospitality. Every spring I found\r\nmyself in possession of a large number of invitations from landed\r\nproprietors in different parts of the country--far more than I could\r\npossibly accept--and a great part of the summer was generally spent in\r\nwandering about from one country-house to another. I have no intention\r\nof asking the reader to accompany me in all these expeditions--for\r\nthough pleasant in reality, they might be tedious in description--but\r\nI wish to introduce him to some typical examples of the landed\r\nproprietors. Among them are to be found nearly all ranks and conditions\r\nof men, from the rich magnate, surrounded with the refined luxury of\r\nWest-European civilisation, to the poor, ill-clad, ignorant owner of a\r\nfew acres which barely supply him with the necessaries of life. Let us\r\ntake, first of all, a few specimens from the middle ranks.\r\n\r\nIn one of the central provinces, near the bank of a sluggish, meandering\r\nstream, stands an irregular group of wooden constructions--old,\r\nunpainted, blackened by time, and surmounted by high, sloping roofs\r\nof moss-covered planks. The principal building is a long, one-storied\r\ndwelling-house, constructed at right angles to the road. At the front\r\nof the house is a spacious, ill-kept yard, and at the back an equally\r\nspacious shady garden, in which art carries on a feeble conflict with\r\nencroaching nature. At the other side of the yard, and facing the front\r\ndoor--or rather the front doors, for there are two--stand the stables,\r\nhay-shed, and granary, and near to that end of the house which is\r\nfarthest from the road are two smaller houses, one of which is the\r\nkitchen, and the other the Lyudskaya, or servants\u0027 apartments. Beyond\r\nthese we can perceive, through a single row of lime-trees, another\r\ngroup of time-blackened wooden constructions in a still more dilapidated\r\ncondition. That is the farmyard.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly not much symmetry in the disposition of these\r\nbuildings, but there is nevertheless a certain order and meaning in the\r\napparent chaos. All the buildings which do not require stoves are built\r\nat a considerable distance from the dwelling-house and kitchen, which\r\nare more liable to take fire; and the kitchen stands by itself, because\r\nthe odour of cookery where oil is used is by no means agreeable, even\r\nfor those whose olfactory nerves are not very sensitive. The plan of the\r\nhouse is likewise not without a certain meaning. The rigorous separation\r\nof the sexes, which formed a characteristic trait of old Russian\r\nsociety, has long since disappeared, but its influence may still be\r\ntraced in houses built on the old model. The house in question is one of\r\nthese, and consequently it is composed of three sections--at the one\r\nend the male apartments, at the other the female apartments, and in the\r\nmiddle the neutral territory, comprising the dining-room and the salon.\r\nThis arrangement has its conveniences, and explains the fact that the\r\nhouse has two front doors. At the back is a third door, which opens from\r\nthe neutral territory into a spacious verandah overlooking the garden.\r\n\r\nHere lives, and has lived for many years, Ivan Ivanovitch K----, a\r\ngentleman of the old school, and a very worthy man of his kind. If we\r\nlook at him as he sits in his comfortable armchair, with his capacious\r\ndressing-gown hanging loosely about him, we shall be able to read at a\r\nglance something of his character. Nature endowed him with large bones\r\nand broad shoulders, and evidently intended him to be a man of great\r\nmuscular power, but he has contrived to frustrate this benevolent\r\nintention, and has now more fat than muscle. His close-cropped head\r\nis round as a bullet, and his features are massive and heavy, but\r\nthe heaviness is relieved by an expression of calm contentment and\r\nimperturbable good-nature, which occasionally blossoms into a broad\r\ngrin. His face is one of those on which no amount of histrionic talent\r\ncould produce a look of care and anxiety, and for this it is not to\r\nblame, for such an expression has never been demanded of it. Like\r\nother mortals, he sometimes experiences little annoyances, and on such\r\noccasions his small grey eyes sparkle and his face becomes suffused with\r\na crimson glow that suggests apoplexy; but ill-fortune has never been\r\nable to get sufficiently firm hold of him to make him understand what\r\nsuch words as care and anxiety mean. Of struggle, disappointment, hope,\r\nand all the other feelings which give to human life a dramatic interest,\r\nhe knows little by hearsay and nothing by experience. He has, in\r\nfact, always lived outside of that struggle for existence which modern\r\nphilosophers declare to be the law of nature.\r\n\r\nSomewhere about seventy years ago Ivan Ivan\u0027itch was born in the house\r\nwhere he still lives. His first lessons he received from the parish\r\npriest, and afterwards he was taught by a deacon\u0027s son, who had studied\r\nin the ecclesiastical seminary to so little purpose that he was unable\r\nto pass the final examination. By both of these teachers he was treated\r\nwith extreme leniency, and was allowed to learn as little as he chose.\r\nHis father wished him to study hard, but his mother was afraid that\r\nstudy might injure his health, and accordingly gave him several holidays\r\nevery week. Under these circumstances his progress was naturally\r\nnot very rapid, and he was still very slightly acquainted with the\r\nelementary rules of arithmetic, when his father one day declared that he\r\nwas already eighteen years of age, and must at once enter the service.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of service? Ivan had no natural inclination for any\r\nkind of activity. The project of entering him as a Junker in a cavalry\r\nregiment, the colonel of which was an old friend of the family, did not\r\nat all please him. He had no love for military service, and positively\r\ndisliked the prospect of an examination. Whilst seeming, therefore,\r\nto bow implicitly to the paternal authority, he induced his mother to\r\noppose the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe dilemma in which Ivan found himself was this: in deference to his\r\nfather he wished to be in the service and gain that official rank\r\nwhich every Russian noble desires to possess, and at the same time, in\r\ndeference to his mother and his own tastes, he wished to remain at home\r\nand continue his indolent mode of life. The Marshal of the Noblesse, who\r\nhappened to call one day, helped him out of the difficulty by offering\r\nto inscribe him as secretary in the Dvoryanskaya Opeka, a bureau which\r\nacts as curator for the estates of minors. All the duties of this office\r\ncould be fulfilled by a paid secretary, and the nominal occupant would\r\nbe periodically promoted as if he were an active official. This was\r\nprecisely what Ivan required. He accepted eagerly the proposal, and\r\nobtained, in the course of seven years, without any effort on his\r\npart, the rank of \"collegiate secretary,\" corresponding to the\r\n\"capitaine-en-second\" of the military hierarchy. To mount higher he\r\nwould have had to seek some place where he could not have fulfilled his\r\nduty by proxy, so he determined to rest on his laurels, and sent in his\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the termination of his official life his married\r\nlife began. Before his resignation had been accepted he suddenly found\r\nhimself one morning on the high road to matrimony. Here again there was\r\nno effort on his part. The course of true love, which is said never to\r\nrun smooth for ordinary mortals, ran smooth for him. He never had even\r\nthe trouble of proposing. The whole affair was arranged by his parents,\r\nwho chose as bride for their son the only daughter of their nearest\r\nneighbour. The young lady was only about sixteen years of age, and was\r\nnot remarkable for beauty, talent, or any other peculiarity, but she had\r\none very important qualification--she was the daughter of a man who\r\nhad an estate contiguous to their own, and who might give as a dowry\r\na certain bit of land which they had long desired to add to their own\r\nproperty. The negotiations, being of a delicate nature, were entrusted\r\nto an old lady who had a great reputation for diplomatic skill in such\r\nmatters, and she accomplished her mission with such success that in the\r\ncourse of a few weeks the preliminaries were arranged and the day fixed\r\nfor the wedding. Thus Ivan Ivan\u0027itch won his bride as easily as he had\r\nwon his tchin of \"collegiate secretary.\"\r\n\r\nThough the bridegroom had received rather than taken to himself a wife,\r\nand did not imagine for a moment that he was in love, he had no reason\r\nto regret the choice that was made for him. Maria Petrovna was exactly\r\nsuited by character and education to be the wife of a man like Ivan\r\nIvan\u0027itch. She had grown up at home in the society of nurses and\r\nservant-maids, and had never learned anything more than could be\r\nobtained from the parish priest and from \"Ma\u0027mselle,\" a personage\r\noccupying a position midway between a servant-maid and a governess.\r\nThe first events of her life were the announcement that she was to be\r\nmarried and the preparations for the wedding. She still remembers the\r\ndelight which the purchase of her trousseau afforded her, and keeps in\r\nher memory a full catalogue of the articles bought. The first years\r\nof her married life were not very happy, for she was treated by her\r\nmother-in-law as a naughty child who required to be frequently snubbed\r\nand lectured; but she bore the discipline with exemplary patience, and\r\nin due time became her own mistress and autocratic ruler in all domestic\r\naffairs. From that time she has lived an active, uneventful life.\r\nBetween her and her husband there is as much mutual attachment as can\r\nreasonably be expected in phlegmatic natures after half a century of\r\nmatrimony. She has always devoted her energies to satisfying his simple\r\nmaterial wants--of intellectual wants he has none--and securing his\r\ncomfort in every possible way. Under this fostering care he \"effeminated\r\nhimself\" (obabilsya), as he is wont to say. His love of shooting died\r\nout, he cared less and less to visit his neighbours, and each successive\r\nyear he spent more and more time in his comfortable arm-chair.\r\n\r\nThe daily life of this worthy couple is singularly regular and\r\nmonotonous, varying only with the changing seasons. In summer Ivan\r\nIvan\u0027itch gets up about seven o\u0027clock, and puts on, with the assistance\r\nof his valet de chambre, a simple costume, consisting chiefly of a\r\nfaded, plentifully stained dressing-gown. Having nothing particular\r\nto do, he sits down at the open window and looks into the yard. As the\r\nservants pass he stops and questions them, and then gives them orders,\r\nor scolds them, as circumstances demand. Towards nine o\u0027clock tea is\r\nannounced, and he goes into the dining-room--a long, narrow apartment\r\nwith bare wooden floor and no furniture but a table and chairs, all in a\r\nmore or less rickety condition. Here he finds his wife with the tea-urn\r\nbefore her. In a few minutes the grandchildren come in, kiss their\r\ngrandpapa\u0027s hand, and take their places round the table. As this morning\r\nmeal consists merely of bread and tea, it does not last long; and all\r\ndisperse to their several occupations. The head of the house begins the\r\nlabours of the day by resuming his seat at the open window. When he has\r\nsmoked some cigarettes and indulged in a proportionate amount of silent\r\ncontemplation, he goes out with the intention of visiting the stables\r\nand farmyard, but generally before he has crossed the court he finds the\r\nheat unbearable, and returns to his former position by the open window.\r\nHere he sits tranquilly till the sun has so far moved round that the\r\nverandah at the back of the house is completely in the shade, when he\r\nhas his arm-chair removed thither, and sits there till dinner-time.\r\n\r\nMaria Petrovna spends her morning in a more active way. As soon as the\r\nbreakfast table has been cleared she goes to the larder, takes stock\r\nof the provisions, arranges the menu du jour, and gives to the cook the\r\nnecessary materials, with detailed instructions as to how they are to\r\nbe prepared. The rest of the morning she devotes to her other household\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nTowards one o\u0027clock dinner is announced, and Ivan Ivan\u0027itch prepares his\r\nappetite by swallowing at a gulp a wineglassful of home-made bitters.\r\nDinner is the great event of the day. The food is abundant and of good\r\nquality, but mushrooms, onions, and fat play a rather too important part\r\nin the repast, and the whole is prepared with very little attention\r\nto the recognised principles of culinary hygiene. Many of the dishes,\r\nindeed, would make a British valetudinarian stand aghast, but they seem\r\nto produce no bad effect on those Russian organisms which have never\r\nbeen weakened by town life, nervous excitement, or intellectual\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the last dish been removed than a deathlike stillness\r\nfalls upon the house: it is the time of the after-dinner siesta.\r\nThe young folks go into the garden, and all the other members of the\r\nhousehold give way to the drowsiness naturally engendered by a heavy\r\nmeal on a hot summer day. Ivan Ivan\u0027itch retires to his own room, from\r\nwhich the flies have been carefully expelled. Maria Petrovna dozes in\r\nan arm-chair in the sitting-room, with a pocket-handkerchief spread\r\nover her face. The servants snore in the corridors, the garret, or the\r\nhay-shed; and even the old watch-dog in the corner of the yard stretches\r\nhimself out at full length on the shady side of his kennel.\r\n\r\nIn about two hours the house gradually re-awakens. Doors begin to creak;\r\nthe names of various servants are bawled out in all tones, from bass to\r\nfalsetto; and footsteps are heard in the yard. Soon a man-servant issues\r\nfrom the kitchen bearing an enormous tea-urn, which puffs like a little\r\nsteam-engine. The family assembles for tea. In Russia, as elsewhere,\r\nsleep after a heavy meal produces thirst, so that the tea and other\r\nbeverages are very acceptable. Then some little delicacies are\r\nserved--such as fruit and wild berries, or cucumbers with honey,\r\nor something else of the kind, and the family again disperses. Ivan\r\nIvan\u0027itch takes a turn in the fields on his begovuiya droshki--an\r\nextremely light vehicle composed of two pairs of wheels joined together\r\nby a single board, on which the driver sits stride-legged; and Maria\r\nPetrovna probably receives a visit from the Popadya (the priest\u0027s wife),\r\nwho is the chief gossipmonger of the neighbourhood. There is not much\r\nscandal in the district, but what little there is the Popadya carefully\r\ncollects, and distributes among her acquaintances with undiscriminating\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\nIn the evening it often happens that a little group of peasants come\r\ninto the court, and ask to see the \"master.\" The master goes to the\r\ndoor, and generally finds that they have some favour to request. In\r\nreply to his question, \"Well, children, what do you want?\" they tell\r\ntheir story in a confused, rambling way, several of them speaking at a\r\ntime, and he has to question and cross-question them before he comes to\r\nunderstand clearly what they desire. If he tells them he cannot grant\r\nit, they probably do not accept a first refusal, but endeavour by means\r\nof supplication to make him reconsider his decision. Stepping forward\r\na little, and bowing low, one of the group begins in a half-respectful,\r\nhalf-familiar, caressing tone: \"Little Father, Ivan Ivan\u0027itch, be\r\ngracious; you are our father, and we are your children\"--and so on.\r\nIvan Ivan\u0027itch good-naturedly listens, and again explains that he cannot\r\ngrant what they ask; but they have still hopes of gaining their point by\r\nentreaty, and continue their supplications till at last his patience is\r\nexhausted and he says to them in a paternal tone, \"Now, enough! enough!\r\nyou are blockheads--blockheads all round! There\u0027s no use talking; it\r\ncan\u0027t be done.\" And with these words he enters the house, so as to\r\nprevent all further discussion.\r\n\r\nA regular part of the evening\u0027s occupation is the interview with the\r\nsteward. The work that has just been done, and the programme for the\r\nmorrow, are always discussed at great length; and much time is spent in\r\nspeculating as to the weather during the next few days. On this latter\r\npoint the calendar is always carefully consulted, and great confidence\r\nis placed in its predictions, though past experience has often shown\r\nthat they are not to be implicitly trusted. The conversation drags on\r\ntill supper is announced, and immediately after that meal, which is an\r\nabridged repetition of dinner, all retire for the night.\r\n\r\nThus pass the days and weeks and months in the house of Ivan Ivan\u0027itch,\r\nand rarely is there any deviation from the ordinary programme. The\r\nclimate necessitates, of course, some slight modifications. When it is\r\ncold, the doors and windows have to be kept shut, and after heavy rains\r\nthose who do not like to wade in mud have to remain in the house\r\nor garden. In the long winter evenings the family assembles in the\r\nsitting-room, and all kill time as best they can. Ivan Ivan\u0027itch smokes\r\nand meditates or listens to the barrel-organ played by one of the\r\nchildren. Maria Petrovna knits a stocking. The old aunt, who commonly\r\nspends the winter with them, plays Patience, and sometimes draws from\r\nthe game conclusions as to the future. Her favourite predictions are\r\nthat a stranger will arrive, or that a marriage will take place, and she\r\ncan determine the sex of the stranger and the colour of the bridegroom\u0027s\r\nhair; but beyond this her art does not go, and she cannot satisfy the\r\nyoung ladies\u0027 curiosity as to further details.\r\n\r\nBooks and newspapers are rarely seen in the sitting-room, but for those\r\nwho wish to read there is a book-case full of miscellaneous literature,\r\nwhich gives some idea of the literary tastes of the family during\r\nseveral generations. The oldest volumes were bought by Ivan Ivan\u0027itch\u0027s\r\ngrandfather--a man who, according to the family traditions, enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the great Catherine. Though wholly overlooked by recent\r\nhistorians, he was evidently a man who had some pretensions to culture.\r\nHe had his portrait painted by a foreign artist of considerable\r\ntalent--it still hangs in the sitting-room--and he bought several pieces\r\nof Sevres ware, the last of which stands on a commode in the corner\r\nand contrasts strangely with the rude home-made furniture and squalid\r\nappearance of the apartment. Among the books which bear his name are\r\nthe tragedies of Sumarokof, who imagined himself to be \"the Russian\r\nVoltaire\"; the amusing comedies of Von-Wisin, some of which still keep\r\nthe stage; the loud-sounding odes of the courtly Derzhavin; two or three\r\nbooks containing the mystic wisdom of Freemasonry as interpreted by\r\nSchwarz and Novikoff; Russian translations of Richardson\u0027s \"Pamela,\"\r\n\"Sir Charles Grandison,\" and \"Clarissa Harlowe\"; Rousseau\u0027s \"Nouvelle\r\nHeloise,\" in Russian garb; and three or four volumes of Voltaire in\r\nthe original. Among the works collected at a somewhat later period are\r\ntranslations of Ann Radcliffe, of Scott\u0027s early novels, and of Ducray\r\nDumenil, whose stories, \"Lolotte et Fanfan\" and \"Victor,\" once enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation. At this point the literary tastes of the family\r\nappear to have died out, for the succeeding literature is represented\r\nexclusively by Kryloff\u0027s Fables, a farmer\u0027s manual, a handbook of family\r\nmedicine, and a series of calendars. There are, however, some signs of\r\na revival, for on the lowest shelf stand recent editions of Pushkin,\r\nLermontof, and Gogol, and a few works by living authors.\r\n\r\nSometimes the monotony of the winter is broken by visiting neighbours\r\nand receiving visitors in return, or in a more decided way by a visit\r\nof a few days to the capital of the province. In the latter case Maria\r\nPetrovna spends nearly all her time in shopping, and brings home a large\r\ncollection of miscellaneous articles. The inspection of these by the\r\nassembled family forms an important domestic event, which completely\r\nthrows into the shade the occasional visits of peddlers and colporteurs.\r\nThen there are the festivities at Christmas and Easter, and occasionally\r\nlittle incidents of less agreeable kind. It may be that there is a heavy\r\nfall of snow, so that it is necessary to cut roads to the kitchen and\r\nstables; or wolves enter the courtyard at night and have a fight with\r\nthe watch-dogs; or the news is brought that a peasant who had been\r\ndrinking in a neighbouring village has been found frozen to death on the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nAltogether the family live a very isolated life, but they have one bond\r\nof connection with the great outer world. Two of the sons are officers\r\nin the army and both of them write home occasionally to their mother\r\nand sisters. To these two youths is devoted all the little stock of\r\nsentimentality which Maria Petrovna possesses. She can talk of them\r\nby the hour to any one who will listen to her, and has related to the\r\nPopadya a hundred times every trivial incident of their lives. Though\r\nthey have never given her much cause for anxiety, and they are now men\r\nof middle age, she lives in constant fear that some evil may befall\r\nthem. What she most fears is that they may be sent on a campaign or may\r\nfall in love with actresses. War and actresses are, in fact, the two\r\nbug-bears of her existence, and whenever she has a disquieting dream she\r\nasks the priest to offer up a moleben for the safety of her absent\r\nones. Sometimes she ventures to express her anxiety to her husband, and\r\nrecommends him to write to them; but he considers writing a letter a\r\nvery serious bit of work, and always replies evasively, \"Well, well, we\r\nmust think about it.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean War Ivan Ivan\u0027itch half awoke from his habitual\r\nlethargy, and read occasionally the meagre official reports published by\r\nthe Government. He was a little surprised that no great victories were\r\nreported, and that the army did not at once advance on Constantinople.\r\nAs to causes he never speculated. Some of his neighbours told him that\r\nthe army was disorganised, and the whole system of Nicholas had been\r\nproved to be utterly worthless. That might all be very true, but he did\r\nnot understand military and political matters. No doubt it would all\r\ncome right in the end. All did come right, after a fashion, and he again\r\ngave up reading newspapers; but ere long he was startled by reports much\r\nmore alarming than any rumours of war. People began to talk about\r\nthe peasant question, and to say openly that the serfs must soon be\r\nemancipated. For once in his life Ivan Ivan\u0027itch asked explanations.\r\nFinding one of his neighbours, who had always been a respectable,\r\nsensible man, and a severe disciplinarian, talking in this way, he took\r\nhim aside and asked what it all meant. The neighbour explained that the\r\nold order of things had shown itself bankrupt and was doomed, that a\r\nnew epoch was opening, that everything was to be reformed, and that\r\nthe Emperor, in accordance with a secret clause of the Treaty with the\r\nAllies, was about to grant a Constitution! Ivan Ivan\u0027itch listened for\r\na little in silence, and then, with a gesture of impatience, interrupted\r\nthe speaker: \"Polno duratchitsya! enough of fun and tomfoolery. Vassili\r\nPetrovitch, tell me seriously what you mean.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Vassili Petrovitch vowed that he spoke in all seriousness, his\r\nfriend gazed at him with a look of intense compassion, and remarked, as\r\nhe turned away, \"So you, too, have gone out of your mind!\"\r\n\r\nThe utterances of Vassili Petrovitch, which his lethargic, sober-minded\r\nfriend regarded as indicating temporary insanity in the speaker,\r\nrepresented fairly the mental condition of very many Russian nobles at\r\nthat time, and were not without a certain foundation. The idea about a\r\nsecret clause in the Treaty of Paris was purely imaginary, but it was\r\nquite true that the country was entering on an epoch of great reforms,\r\namong which the Emancipation question occupied the chief place. Of\r\nthis even the sceptical Ivan Ivan\u0027itch was soon convinced. The Emperor\r\nformally declared to the Noblesse of the province of Moscow that the\r\nactual state of things could not continue forever, and called on the\r\nlanded proprietors to consider by what means the condition of their\r\nserfs might be ameliorated. Provincial committees were formed for the\r\npurpose of preparing definite projects, and gradually it became apparent\r\nthat the emancipation of the serfs was really at hand.\r\n\r\nIvan Ivan\u0027itch was alarmed at the prospect of losing his authority\r\nover his serfs. Though he had never been a cruel taskmaster, he had not\r\nspared the rod when he considered it necessary, and he believed birch\r\ntwigs to be a necessary instrument in the Russian system of agriculture.\r\nFor some time he drew consolation from the thought that peasants were\r\nnot birds of the air, that they must under all circumstances require\r\nfood and clothing, and that they would be ready to serve him as\r\nagricultural labourers; but when he learned that they were to receive\r\na large part of the estate for their own use, his hopes fell, and he\r\ngreatly feared that he would be inevitably ruined.\r\n\r\nThese dark forebodings have not been by any means realised. His serfs\r\nwere emancipated and received about a half of the estate, but in return\r\nfor the land ceded they paid him annually a considerable sum, and they\r\nwere always ready to cultivate his fields for a fair remuneration. The\r\nyearly outlay was considerably greater, but the price of grain rose,\r\nand this counterbalanced the additional yearly expenditure. The\r\nadministration of the estate has become much less patriarchal; much that\r\nwas formerly left to custom and tacit understanding is now regulated\r\nby express agreement on purely commercial principles; a great deal more\r\nmoney is paid out and a great deal more received; there is much less\r\nauthority in the hands of the master, and his responsibilities are\r\nproportionately diminished; but in spite of all these changes, Ivan\r\nIvan\u0027itch would have great difficulty in deciding whether he is a richer\r\nor a poorer man. He has fewer horses and fewer servants, but he has\r\nstill more than he requires, and his mode of life has undergone no\r\nperceptible alteration. Maria Petrovna complains that she is no longer\r\nsupplied with eggs, chickens, and homespun linen by the peasants, and\r\nthat everything is three times as dear as it used to be; but somehow the\r\nlarder is still full, and abundance reigns in the house as of old.\r\n\r\nIvan Ivan\u0027itch certainly does not possess transcendent qualities of any\r\nkind. It would be impossible to make a hero out of him, even though his\r\nown son should be his biographer. Muscular Christians may reasonably\r\ndespise him, an active, energetic man may fairly condemn him for\r\nhis indolence and apathy. But, on the other hand, he has no very\r\nbad qualities. His vices are of the passive, negative kind. He is a\r\nrespectable if not a distinguished member of society, and appears a\r\nvery worthy man when compared with many of his neighbours who have\r\nbeen brought up in similar conditions. Take, for instance, his younger\r\nbrother Dimitri, who lives a short way off.\r\n\r\nDimitri Ivanovitch, like his brother Ivan, had been endowed by nature\r\nwith a very decided repugnance to prolonged intellectual exertion,\r\nbut as he was a man of good parts he did not fear a Junker\u0027s\r\nexamination--especially when he could count on the colonel\u0027s\r\nprotection--and accordingly entered the army. In his regiment were a\r\nnumber of jovial young officers like himself, always ready to relieve\r\nthe monotony of garrison life by boisterous dissipation, and among these\r\nhe easily acquired the reputation of being a thoroughly good fellow. In\r\ndrinking bouts he could hold his own with the best of them, and in all\r\nmad pranks invariably played the chief part. By this means he endeared\r\nhimself to his comrades, and for a time all went well. The colonel had\r\nhimself sown wild oats plentifully in his youth, and was quite disposed\r\nto overlook, as far as possible, the bacchanalian peccadilloes of his\r\nsubordinates. But before many years had passed, the regiment suddenly\r\nchanged its character. Certain rumours had reached headquarters, and the\r\nEmperor Nicholas appointed as colonel a stern disciplinarian of German\r\norigin, who aimed at making the regiment a kind of machine that should\r\nwork with the accuracy of a chronometer.\r\n\r\nThis change did not at all suit the tastes of Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch. He\r\nchafed under the new restraints, and as soon as he had gained the rank\r\nof lieutenant retired from the service to enjoy the freedom of country\r\nlife. Shortly afterwards his father died, and he thereby became owner of\r\nan estate, with two hundred serfs. He did not, like his elder brother,\r\nmarry, and \"effeminate himself,\" but he did worse. In his little\r\nindependent kingdom--for such was practically a Russian estate in the\r\ngood old times--he was lord of all he surveyed, and gave full scope to\r\nhis boisterous humour, his passion for sport, and his love of drinking\r\nand dissipation. Many of the mad pranks in which he indulged will long\r\nbe preserved by popular tradition, but they cannot well be related here.\r\n\r\nDimitri Ivan\u0027itch is now a man long past middle age, and still continues\r\nhis wild, dissipated life. His house resembles an ill-kept, disreputable\r\ntavern. The floor is filthy, the furniture chipped and broken, the\r\nservants indolent, slovenly, and in rags. Dogs of all breeds and sizes\r\nroam about the rooms and corridors. The master, when not asleep, is\r\nalways in a more or less complete state of intoxication. Generally\r\nhe has one or two guests staying with him--men of the same type as\r\nhimself--and days and nights are spent in drinking and card-playing.\r\nWhen he cannot have his usual boon-companions he sends for one or two\r\nsmall proprietors who live near--men who are legally nobles, but who are\r\nso poor that they differ little from peasants. Formerly, when ordinary\r\nresources failed, he occasionally had recourse to the violent expedient\r\nof ordering his servants to stop the first passing travellers,\r\nwhoever they might be, and bring them in by persuasion or force, as\r\ncircumstances might demand. If the travellers refused to accept\r\nsuch rough, undesired hospitality, a wheel would be taken off their\r\ntarantass, or some indispensable part of the harness would be secreted,\r\nand they might consider themselves fortunate if they succeeded in\r\ngetting away next morning.*\r\n\r\n     * This custom has fortunately gone out of fashion even in\r\n     outlying districts, but an incident of the kind happened to\r\n     a friend of mine as late as 1871.  He was detained against\r\n     his will for two whole days by a man whom he had never seen\r\n     before, and at last effected his escape by bribing the\r\n     servants of his tyrannical host.\r\n\r\nIn the time of serfage the domestic serfs had much to bear from their\r\ncapricious, violent master. They lived in an atmosphere of abusive\r\nlanguage, and were subjected not unfrequently to corporal punishment.\r\nWorse than this, their master was constantly threatening to \"shave their\r\nforehead\"--that is to say, to give them as recruits--and occasionally he\r\nput his threat into execution, in spite of the wailings and entreaties\r\nof the culprit and his relations. And yet, strange to say, nearly all of\r\nthem remained with him as free servants after the Emancipation.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Russian landed proprietors, I must say that the class\r\nrepresented by Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch has now almost disappeared. It was the\r\nnatural result of serfage and social stagnation--of a state of society\r\nin which there were few legal and moral restraints, and few inducements\r\nto honourable activity.\r\n\r\nAmong the other landed proprietors of the district, one of the best\r\nknown is Nicolai Petrovitch B----, an old military man with the rank of\r\ngeneral. Like Ivan Ivan\u0027itch, he belongs to the old school; but the two\r\nmen must be contrasted rather than compared. The difference in their\r\nlives and characters is reflected in their outward appearance. Ivan\r\nIvan\u0027itch, as we know, is portly in form and heavy in all his movements,\r\nand loves to loll in his arm-chair or to loaf about the house in a\r\ncapacious dressing-gown. The General, on the contrary, is thin, wiry,\r\nand muscular, wears habitually a close-buttoned military tunic, and\r\nalways has a stern expression, the force of which is considerably\r\naugmented by a bristly moustache resembling a shoe-brush. As he paces up\r\nand down the room, knitting his brows and gazing at the floor, he looks\r\nas if he were forming combinations of the first magnitude; but those who\r\nknow him well are aware that this is an optical delusion, of which he\r\nis himself to some extent a victim. He is quite innocent of deep thought\r\nand concentrated intellectual effort. Though he frowns so fiercely he is\r\nby no means of a naturally ferocious temperament. Had he passed all\r\nhis life in the country he would probably have been as good-natured and\r\nphlegmatic as Ivan Ivan\u0027itch himself, but, unlike that worshipper of\r\ntranquillity, he had aspired to rise in the service, and had adopted\r\nthe stern, formal bearing which the Emperor Nicholas considered\r\nindispensable in an officer. The manner which he had at first put on as\r\npart of his uniform became by the force of habit almost a part of his\r\nnature, and at the age of thirty he was a stern disciplinarian and\r\nuncompromising formalist, who confined his attention exclusively to\r\ndrill and other military duties. Thus he rose steadily by his own merit,\r\nand reached the goal of his early ambition--the rank of general.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this point was reached he determined to leave the service and\r\nretire to his property. Many considerations urged him to take this step.\r\nHe enjoyed the title of Excellency which he had long coveted, and when\r\nhe put on his full uniform his breast was bespangled with medals and\r\ndecorations. Since the death of his father the revenues of his estate\r\nhad been steadily decreasing, and report said that the best wood in his\r\nforest was rapidly disappearing. His wife had no love for the country,\r\nand would have preferred to settle in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but they\r\nfound that with their small income they could not live in a large town\r\nin a style suitable to their rank.\r\n\r\nThe General determined to introduce order into his estate, and become\r\na practical farmer; but a little experience convinced him that his new\r\nfunctions were much more difficult than the commanding of a regiment. He\r\nhas long since given over the practical management of the property to a\r\nsteward, and he contents himself with exercising what he imagines to be\r\nan efficient control. Though he wishes to do much, he finds small scope\r\nfor his activity, and spends his days in pretty much the same way as\r\nIvan Ivan\u0027itch, with this difference, that he plays cards whenever he\r\ngets an opportunity, and reads regularly the Moscow Gazette and Russki\r\nInvalid, the official military paper. What specially interests him is\r\nthe list of promotions, retirements, and Imperial rewards for merit and\r\nseniority. When he sees the announcement that some old comrade has been\r\nmade an officer of his Majesty\u0027s suite or has received a grand cordon,\r\nhe frowns a little more than usual, and is tempted to regret that he\r\nretired from the service. Had he waited patiently, perhaps a bit of\r\ngood fortune might have fallen likewise to his lot. This idea takes\r\npossession of him, and during the remainder of the day he is taciturn\r\nand morose. His wife notices the change, and knows the reason of it, but\r\nhas too much good sense and tact to make any allusion to the subject.\r\n\r\nAnna Alexandrovna--as the good lady is called--is an elderly dame\r\nwho does not at all resemble the wife of Ivan Ivan\u0027itch. She was long\r\naccustomed to a numerous military society, with dinner-parties, dancing,\r\npromenades, card-playing, and all the other amusements of garrison life,\r\nand she never contracted a taste for domestic concerns. Her knowledge of\r\nculinary affairs is extremely vague, and she has no idea of how to\r\nmake preserves, nalivka, and other home-made delicacies, though Maria\r\nPetrovna, who is universally acknowledged to be a great adept in such\r\nmatters, has proposed a hundred times to give her some choice recipes.\r\nIn short, domestic affairs are a burden to her, and she entrusts them\r\nas far as possible to the housekeeper. Altogether she finds country life\r\nvery tiresome, but, possessing that placid, philosophical temperament\r\nwhich seems to have some casual connection with corpulence, she submits\r\nwithout murmuring, and tries to lighten a little the unavoidable\r\nmonotony by paying visits and receiving visitors. The neighbours within\r\na radius of twenty miles are, with few exceptions, more or less of\r\nthe Ivan Ivan\u0027itch and Maria Petrovna type--decidedly rustic in their\r\nmanners and conceptions; but their company is better than absolute\r\nsolitude, and they have at least the good quality of being always able\r\nand willing to play cards for any number of hours. Besides this, Anna\r\nAlexandrovna has the satisfaction of feeling that amongst them she is\r\nalmost a great personage, and unquestionably an authority in all matters\r\nof taste and fashion; and she feels specially well disposed towards\r\nthose of them who frequently address her as \"Your Excellency.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief festivities take place on the \"name-days\" of the General and\r\nhis spouse--that is to say, the days sacred to St. Nicholas and\r\nSt. Anna. On these occasions all the neighbours come to offer their\r\ncongratulations, and remain to dinner as a matter of course. After\r\ndinner the older visitors sit down to cards, and the young people\r\nextemporise a dance. The fete is specially successful when the eldest\r\nson comes home to take part in it, and brings a brother officer with\r\nhim. He is now a general like his father.* In days gone by one of his\r\ncomrades was expected to offer his hand to Olga Nekola\u0027vna, the second\r\ndaughter, a delicate young lady who had been educated in one of the\r\ngreat Instituts--gigantic boarding-schools, founded and kept up by the\r\nGovernment, for the daughters of those who are supposed to have deserved\r\nwell of their country. Unfortunately the expected offer was never made,\r\nand she and her sister live at home as old maids, bewailing the absence\r\nof \"civilised\" society, and killing time in a harmless, elegant way by\r\nmeans of music, needlework, and light literature.\r\n\r\n     * Generals are much more common in Russia than in other\r\n     countries. A few years ago there was an old lady in Moscow\r\n     who had a family of ten sons, all of whom were generals!\r\n     The rank may be obtained in the civil as well as the\r\n     military service.\r\n\r\nAt these \"name-day\" gatherings one used to meet still more interesting\r\nspecimens of the old school. One of them I remember particularly. He was\r\na tall, corpulent old man, in a threadbare frock-coat, which wrinkled\r\nup about his waist. His shaggy eyebrows almost covered his small, dull\r\neyes, his heavy moustache partially concealed a large mouth strongly\r\nindicating sensuous tendencies. His hair was cut so short that it was\r\ndifficult to say what its colour would be if it were allowed to grow.\r\nHe always arrived in his tarantass just in time for the zakuska--the\r\nappetising collation that is served shortly before dinner--grunted out\r\na few congratulations to the host and hostess and monosyllabic greetings\r\nto his acquaintances, ate a copious meal, and immediately afterwards\r\nplaced himself at a card-table, where he sat in silence as long as he\r\ncould get any one to play with him. People did not like, however, to\r\nplay with Andrei Vassil\u0027itch, for his society was not agreeable, and he\r\nalways contrived to go home with a well-filled purse.\r\n\r\nAndrei Vassil\u0027itch was a noted man in the neighbourhood. He was the\r\ncentre of a whole cycle of legends, and I have often heard that his name\r\nwas used with effect by nurses to frighten naughty children. I never\r\nmissed an opportunity of meeting him, for I was curious to see and study\r\na legendary monster in the flesh. How far the numerous stories told\r\nabout him were true I cannot pretend to say, but they were certainly\r\nnot without foundation. In his youth he had served for some time in the\r\narmy, and was celebrated, even in an age when martinets had always a\r\ngood chance of promotion, for his brutality to his subordinates. His\r\ncareer was cut short, however, when he had only the rank of captain.\r\nHaving compromised himself in some way, he found it advisable to send in\r\nhis resignation and retire to his estate. Here he organised his house on\r\nMahometan rather than Christian principles, and ruled his servants and\r\npeasants as he had been accustomed to rule his soldiers--using corporal\r\npunishment in merciless fashion. His wife did not venture to protest\r\nagainst the Mahometan arrangements, and any peasant who stood in the way\r\nof their realisation was at once given as a recruit, or transported to\r\nSiberia, in accordance with his master\u0027s demand.* At last his tyranny\r\nand extortion drove his serfs to revolt. One night his house was\r\nsurrounded and set on fire, but he contrived to escape the fate that was\r\nprepared for him, and caused all who had taken part in the revolt to\r\nbe mercilessly punished. This was a severe lesson, but it had no effect\r\nupon him. Taking precautions against a similar surprise, he continued\r\nto tyrannise and extort as before, until in 1861 the serfs were\r\nemancipated, and his authority came to an end.\r\n\r\n     * When a proprietor considered any of his serfs unruly he\r\n     could, according to law, have them transported to Siberia\r\n     without trial, on condition of paying the expenses of\r\n     transport.  Arrived at their destination, they received\r\n     land, and lived as free colonists, with the single\r\n     restriction that they were not allowed to leave the locality\r\n     where they settled.\r\n\r\nA very different sort of man was Pavel Trophim\u0027itch, who likewise came\r\nregularly to pay his respects and present his congratulations to the\r\nGeneral and \"Gheneralsha.\"* It was pleasant to turn from the hard,\r\nwrinkled, morose features of the legendary monster to the soft, smooth,\r\njovial face of this man, who had been accustomed to look at the bright\r\nside of things, till his face had caught something of their brightness.\r\n\"A good, jovial, honest face!\" a stranger might exclaim as he looked at\r\nhim. Knowing something of his character and history, I could not endorse\r\nsuch an opinion. Jovial he certainly was, for few men were more capable\r\nof making and enjoying mirth. Good he might be also called, if the word\r\nwere taken in the sense of good-natured, for he never took offence,\r\nand was always ready to do a kindly action if it did not cost him any\r\ntrouble. But as to his honesty, that required some qualification. Wholly\r\nuntarnished his reputation certainly could not be, for he had been a\r\njudge in the District Court before the time of the judicial reforms;\r\nand, not being a Cato, he had succumbed to the usual temptations. He had\r\nnever studied law, and made no pretensions to the possession of great\r\nlegal knowledge. To all who would listen to him he declared openly\r\nthat he knew much more about pointers and setters than about legal\r\nformalities. But his estate was very small, and he could not afford to\r\ngive up his appointment.\r\n\r\n     * The female form of the word General.\r\n\r\nOf these unreformed Courts, which are happily among the things of the\r\npast, I shall have occasion to speak in the sequel. For the present I\r\nwish merely to say that they were thoroughly corrupt, and I hasten to\r\nadd that Pavel Trophim\u0027itch was by no means a judge of the worst kind.\r\nHe had been known to protect widows and orphans against those who wished\r\nto despoil them, and no amount of money would induce him to give an\r\nunjust decision against a friend who had privately explained the case to\r\nhim; but when he knew nothing of the case or of the parties he readily\r\nsigned the decision prepared by the secretary, and quietly pocketed the\r\nproceeds, without feeling any very disagreeable twinges of conscience.\r\nAll judges, he knew, did likewise, and he had no pretension to being\r\nbetter than his fellows.\r\n\r\nWhen Pavel Trophim\u0027itch played cards at the General\u0027s house or\r\nelsewhere, a small, awkward, clean-shaven man, with dark eyes and a\r\nTartar cast of countenance, might generally be seen sitting at the same\r\ntable. His name was Alexei Petrovitch T----. Whether he really had any\r\nTartar blood in him it is impossible to say, but certainly his ancestors\r\nfor one or two generations were all good orthodox Christians. His father\r\nhad been a poor military surgeon in a marching regiment, and he himself\r\nhad become at an early age a scribe in one of the bureaux of the\r\ndistrict town. He was then very poor, and had great difficulty in\r\nsupporting life on the miserable pittance which he received as a salary;\r\nbut he was a sharp, clever youth, and soon discovered that even a scribe\r\nhad a great many opportunities of extorting money from the ignorant\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThese opportunities Alexei Petrovitch used with great ability,\r\nand became known as one of the most accomplished bribe-takers\r\n(vzyatotchniki) in the district. His position, however, was so very\r\nsubordinate that he would never have become rich had he not fallen upon\r\na very ingenious expedient which completely succeeded. Hearing that a\r\nsmall proprietor, who had an only daughter, had come to live in the town\r\nfor a few weeks, he took a room in the inn where the newcomers lived,\r\nand when he had made their acquaintance he fell dangerously ill. Feeling\r\nhis last hours approaching, he sent for a priest, confided to him that\r\nhe had amassed a large fortune, and requested that a will should be\r\ndrawn up. In the will he bequeathed large sums to all his relations, and\r\na considerable sum to the parish church. The whole affair was to be kept\r\na secret till after his death, but his neighbour--the old gentleman with\r\nthe daughter--was called in to act as a witness. When all this had been\r\ndone he did not die, but rapidly recovered, and now induced the old\r\ngentleman to whom he had confided his secret to grant him his daughter\u0027s\r\nhand. The daughter had no objections to marry a man possessed of such\r\nwealth, and the marriage was duly celebrated. Shortly after this the\r\nfather died--without discovering, it is to be hoped, the hoax that had\r\nbeen perpetrated--and Alexei Petrovitch became virtual possessor of\r\na very comfortable little estate. With the change in his fortunes he\r\ncompletely changed his principles, or at least his practice. In all his\r\ndealings he was strictly honest. He lent money, it is true, at from ten\r\nto fifteen per cent., but that was considered in these parts not a very\r\nexorbitant rate of interest, nor was he unnecessarily hard upon his\r\ndebtors.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that an honourable man like the General should\r\nreceive in his house such a motley company, comprising men of decidedly\r\ntarnished reputation; but in this respect he was not at all peculiar.\r\nOne constantly meets in Russian society persons who are known to\r\nhave been guilty of flagrant dishonesty, and we find that men who are\r\nthemselves honourable enough associate with them on friendly terms. This\r\nsocial leniency, moral laxity, or whatever else it may be called, is the\r\nresult of various causes. Several concurrent influences have tended to\r\nlower the moral standard of the Noblesse. Formerly, when the noble lived\r\non his estate, he could play with impunity the petty tyrant, and could\r\nfreely indulge his legitimate and illegitimate caprices without any\r\nlegal or moral restraint. I do not at all mean to assert that all\r\nproprietors abused their authority, but I venture to say that no class\r\nof men can long possess such enormous arbitrary power over those around\r\nthem without being thereby more or less demoralised. When the noble\r\nentered the service he had not the same immunity from restraint--on\r\nthe contrary, his position resembled rather that of the serf--but he\r\nbreathed an atmosphere of peculation and jobbery, little conducive to\r\nmoral purity and uprightness. If an official had refused to associate\r\nwith those who were tainted with the prevailing vices, he would have\r\nfound himself completely isolated, and would have been ridiculed as a\r\nmodern Don Quixote. Add to this that all classes of the Russian people\r\nhave a certain kindly, apathetic good-nature which makes them very\r\ncharitable towards their neighbours, and that they do not always\r\ndistinguish between forgiving private injury and excusing public\r\ndelinquencies. If we bear all this in mind, we may readily understand\r\nthat in the time of serfage and maladministration a man could be\r\nguilty of very reprehensible practises without incurring social\r\nexcommunication.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of moral awakening, after the Crimean War and the\r\ndeath of Nicholas I., society revelled in virtuous indignation against\r\nthe prevailing abuses, and placed on the pillory the most prominent\r\ndelinquents; but the intensity of the moral feeling has declined, and\r\nsomething of the old apathy has returned. This might have been predicted\r\nby any one well acquainted with the character and past history of the\r\nRussian people. Russia advances on the road of progress, not in that\r\nsmooth, gradual, prosaic way to which we are accustomed, but by a series\r\nof unconnected, frantic efforts, each of which is naturally followed by\r\na period of temporary exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nPROPRIETORS OF THE MODERN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nA Russian Petit Maitre--His House and Surroundings--Abortive Attempts\r\nto Improve Agriculture and the Condition of the Serfs--A Comparison--A\r\n\"Liberal\" Tchinovnik--His Idea of Progress--A Justice of the Peace--His\r\nOpinion of Russian Literature, Tchinovniks, and Petits Maitres--His\r\nSupposed and Real Character--An Extreme Radical--Disorders in\r\nthe Universities--Administrative Procedure--Russia\u0027s Capacity for\r\nAccomplishing Political and Social Evolutions--A Court Dignitary in his\r\nCountry House.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have presented to the reader old-fashioned types which were\r\ncommon enough thirty years ago, when I first resided in Russia, but\r\nwhich are rapidly disappearing. Let me now present a few of the modern\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIn the same district as Ivan Ivan\u0027itch and the General lives Victor\r\nAlexandr\u0027itch L----. As we approach his house we can at once perceive\r\nthat he differs from the majority of his neighbours. The gate is painted\r\nand moves easily on its hinges, the fence is in good repair, the short\r\navenue leading up to the front door is well kept, and in the garden we\r\ncan perceive at a glance that more attention is paid to flowers than\r\nto vegetables. The house is of wood, and not large, but it has some\r\narchitectural pretensions in the form of a great, pseudo-Doric wooden\r\nportico that covers three-fourths of the façade. In the interior\r\nwe remark everywhere the influence of Western civilisation. Victor\r\nAlexandr\u0027itch is by no means richer than Ivan Ivan\u0027itch, but his rooms\r\nare much more luxuriously furnished. The furniture is of a lighter\r\nmodel, more comfortable, and in a much better state of preservation.\r\nInstead of the bare, scantily furnished sitting-room, with the\r\nold-fashioned barrel-organ which played only six airs, we find an\r\nelegant drawing-room, with a piano by one of the most approved makers,\r\nand numerous articles of foreign manufacture, comprising a small buhl\r\ntable and two bits of genuine old Wedgwood. The servants are clean,\r\nand dressed in European costume. The master, too, is very different\r\nin appearance. He pays great attention to his toilette, wearing a\r\ndressing-gown only in the early morning, and a fashionable lounging\r\ncoat during the rest of the day. The Turkish pipes which his grandfather\r\nloved he holds in abhorrence, and habitually smokes cigarettes. With his\r\nwife and daughters he always speaks French, and calls them by French or\r\nEnglish names.\r\n\r\nBut the part of the house which most strikingly illustrates the\r\ndifference between old and new is \"le cabinet de monsieur.\" In the\r\ncabinet of Ivan Ivan\u0027itch the furniture consists of a broad sofa which\r\nserves as a bed, a few deal chairs, and a clumsy deal table, on which\r\nare generally to be found a bundle of greasy papers, an old chipped\r\nink-bottle, a pen, and a calendar. The cabinet of Victor Alexandr\u0027itch\r\nhas an entirely different appearance. It is small, but at once\r\ncomfortable and elegant. The principal objects which it contains are a\r\nlibrary-table, with ink-stand, presse-papier, paper-knives, and other\r\narticles in keeping, and in the opposite corner a large bookcase. The\r\ncollection of books is remarkable, not from the number of volumes or\r\nthe presence of rare editions, but from the variety of the subjects.\r\nHistory, art, fiction, the drama, political economy, and agriculture\r\nare represented in about equal proportions. Some of the works are\r\nin Russian, others in German, a large number in French, and a few\r\nin Italian. The collection illustrates the former life and present\r\noccupations of the owner.\r\n\r\nThe father of Victor Alexandr\u0027itch was a landed proprietor who had\r\nmade a successful career in the civil service, and desired that his son\r\nshould follow the same profession. For this purpose Victor was first\r\ncarefully trained at home, and then sent to the University of Moscow,\r\nwhere he spent four years as a student of law. From the University he\r\npassed to the Ministry of the Interior in St. Petersburg, but he found\r\nthe monotonous routine of official life not at all suited to his taste,\r\nand very soon sent in his resignation. The death of his father had made\r\nhim proprietor of an estate, and thither he retired, hoping to find\r\nthere plenty of occupation more congenial than the writing of official\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Moscow he had attended lectures on history and\r\nphilosophy, and had got through a large amount of desultory reading.\r\nThe chief result of his studies was the acquisition of many ill-digested\r\ngeneral principles, and certain vague, generous, humanitarian\r\naspirations. With this intellectual capital he hoped to lead a useful\r\nlife in the country. When he had repaired and furnished the house he set\r\nhimself to improve the estate. In the course of his promiscuous reading\r\nhe had stumbled on some descriptions of English and Tuscan agriculture,\r\nand had there learned what wonders might be effected by a rational\r\nsystem of farming. Why should not Russia follow the example of England\r\nand Tuscany? By proper drainage, plentiful manure, good ploughs, and the\r\ncultivation of artificial grasses, the production might be multiplied\r\ntenfold; and by the introduction of agricultural machines the manual\r\nlabour might be greatly diminished. All this seemed as simple as a sum\r\nin arithmetic, and Victor Alexandr\u0027itch, more scholarum rei familiaris\r\nignarus, without a moment\u0027s hesitation expended his ready money in\r\nprocuring from England a threshing-machine, ploughs, harrows, and other\r\nimplements of the newest model.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of these was an event that was long remembered. The peasants\r\nexamined them with attention, not unmixed with wonder, but said nothing.\r\nWhen the master explained to them the advantages of the new\r\ninstruments, they still remained silent. Only one old man, gazing at the\r\nthreshing-machine, remarked, in an audible \"aside,\" \"A cunning people,\r\nthese Germans!\"* On being asked for their opinion, they replied vaguely,\r\n\"How should we know? It OUGHT to be so.\" But when their master had\r\nretired, and was explaining to his wife and the French governess that\r\nthe chief obstacle to progress in Russia was the apathetic indolence and\r\nconservative spirit of the peasantry, they expressed their opinions more\r\nfreely. \"These may be all very well for the Germans, but they won\u0027t do\r\nfor us. How are our little horses to drag these big ploughs? And as for\r\nthat [the threshing-machine], it\u0027s of no use.\" Further examination\r\nand reflection confirmed this first impression, and it was unanimously\r\ndecided that no good would come of the new-fangled inventions.\r\n\r\n     * The Russian peasant comprehends all the inhabitants of\r\n     Western Europe under the term Nyemtsi, which in the language\r\n     of the educated designates only Germans.  The rest of\r\n     humanity is composed of Pravoslavniye (Greek Orthodox),\r\n     Busurmanye (Mahometans), and Poliacki (Poles).\r\n\r\nThese apprehensions proved to be only too well founded. The ploughs were\r\nmuch too heavy for the peasants\u0027 small horses, and the threshing-machine\r\nbroke down at the first attempt to use it. For the purchase of lighter\r\nimplements or stronger horses there was no ready money, and for the\r\nrepairing of the threshing-machine there was not an engineer within a\r\nradius of a hundred and fifty miles. The experiment was, in short, a\r\ncomplete failure, and the new purchases were put away out of sight.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks after this incident Victor Alexandr\u0027itch felt very\r\ndespondent, and spoke more than usual about the apathy and stupidity of\r\nthe peasantry. His faith in infallible science was somewhat shaken, and\r\nhis benevolent aspirations were for a time laid aside. But this eclipse\r\nof faith was not of long duration. Gradually he recovered his normal\r\ncondition, and began to form new schemes. From the study of certain\r\nworks on political economy he learned that the system of communal\r\nproperty was ruinous to the fertility of the soil, and that free\r\nlabour was always more productive than serfage. By the light of these\r\nprinciples he discovered why the peasantry in Russia were so poor, and\r\nby what means their condition could he ameliorated. The Communal land\r\nshould be divided into family lots, and the serfs, instead of being\r\nforced to work for the proprietor, should pay a yearly sum as rent. The\r\nadvantages of this change he perceived clearly--as clearly as he\r\nhad formerly perceived the advantages of English agricultural\r\nimplements--and he determined to make the experiment on his own estate.\r\n\r\nHis first step was to call together the more intelligent and influential\r\nof his serfs, and to explain to them his project; but his efforts at\r\nexplanation were eminently unsuccessful. Even with regard to ordinary\r\ncurrent affairs he could not express himself in that simple, homely\r\nlanguage with which alone the peasants are familiar, and when he spoke\r\non abstract subjects he naturally became quite unintelligible to his\r\nuneducated audience. The serfs listened attentively, but understood\r\nnothing. He might as well have spoken to them, as he often did in\r\nanother kind of society, about the comparative excellence of Italian\r\nand German music. At a second attempt he had rather more success. The\r\npeasants came to understand that what he wished was to break up the Mir,\r\nor rural Commune, and to put them all on obrok--that is to say,\r\nmake them pay a yearly sum instead of giving him a certain amount of\r\nagricultural labour. Much to his astonishment, his scheme did not meet\r\nwith any sympathy. As to being put on obrok, the serfs did not much\r\nobject, though they preferred to remain as they were; but his proposal\r\nto break up the Mir astonished and bewildered them. They regarded it\r\nas a sea-captain might regard the proposal of a scientific wiseacre\r\nto knock a hole in the ship\u0027s bottom in order to make her sail faster.\r\nThough they did not say much, he was intelligent enough to see that they\r\nwould offer a strenuous passive resistance, and as he did not wish\r\nto act tyrannically, he let the matter drop. Thus a second benevolent\r\nscheme was shipwrecked. Many other schemes had a similar fate, and\r\nVictor Alexandr\u0027itch began to perceive that it was very difficult to\r\ndo good in this world, especially when the persons to be benefited were\r\nRussian peasants.\r\n\r\nIn reality the fault lay less with the serfs than with their master.\r\nVictor Alexandr\u0027itch was by no means a stupid man. On the contrary, he\r\nhad more than average talents. Few men were more capable of grasping\r\na new idea and forming a scheme for its realisation, and few men could\r\nplay more dexterously with abstract principles. What he wanted was\r\nthe power of dealing with concrete facts. The principles which he had\r\nacquired from University lectures and desultory reading were far too\r\nvague and abstract for practical use. He had studied abstract science\r\nwithout gaining any technical knowledge of details, and consequently\r\nwhen he stood face to face with real life he was like a student who,\r\nhaving studied mechanics in text-books, is suddenly placed in a workshop\r\nand ordered to construct a machine. Only there was one difference:\r\nVictor Alexandr\u0027itch was not ordered to do anything. Voluntarily,\r\nwithout any apparent necessity, he set himself to work with tools which\r\nhe could not handle. It was this that chiefly puzzled the peasants. Why\r\nshould he trouble himself with these new schemes, when he might live\r\ncomfortably as he was? In some of his projects they could detect a\r\ndesire to increase the revenue, but in others they could discover\r\nno such motive. In these latter they attributed his conduct to pure\r\ncaprice, and put it into the same category as those mad pranks in which\r\nproprietors of jovial humour sometimes indulged.\r\n\r\nIn the last years of serfage there were a good many landed proprietors\r\nlike Victor Alexandr\u0027itch--men who wished to do something beneficent,\r\nand did not know how to do it. When serfage was being abolished the\r\nmajority of these men took an active part in the great work and rendered\r\nvaluable service to their country. Victor Alexandr\u0027itch acted otherwise.\r\nAt first he sympathised warmly with the proposed emancipation and\r\nwrote several articles on the advantages of free labour, but when the\r\nGovernment took the matter into its own hands he declared that the\r\nofficials had deceived and slighted the Noblesse, and he went over to\r\nthe opposition. Before the Imperial Edict was signed he went abroad, and\r\ntravelled for three years in Germany, France, and Italy. Shortly after\r\nhis return he married a pretty, accomplished young lady, the daughter of\r\nan eminent official in St. Petersburg, and since that time he has lived\r\nin his country-house.\r\n\r\nThough a man of education and culture, Victor Alexandr\u0027itch spends his\r\ntime in almost as indolent a way as the men of the old school. He rises\r\nsomewhat later, and instead of sitting by the open window and gazing\r\ninto the courtyard, he turns over the pages of a book or periodical.\r\nInstead of dining at midday and supping at nine o\u0027clock, he takes\r\ndejeuner at twelve and dines at five. He spends less time in sitting in\r\nthe verandah and pacing up and down with his hands behind his back,\r\nfor he can vary the operation of time-killing by occasionally writing\r\na letter, or by standing behind his wife at the piano while she plays\r\nselections from Mozart and Beethoven. But these peculiarities are merely\r\nvariations in detail. If there is any essential difference between the\r\nlives of Victor Alexandr\u0027itch and of Ivan Ivan\u0027itch, it is in the fact\r\nthat the former never goes out into the fields to see how the work is\r\ndone, and never troubles himself with the state of the weather, the\r\ncondition of the crops, and cognate subjects. He leaves the management\r\nof his estate entirely to his steward, and refers to that personage all\r\npeasants who come to him with complaints or petitions. Though he takes\r\na deep interest in the peasant as an impersonal, abstract entity, and\r\nloves to contemplate concrete examples of the genus in the works of\r\ncertain popular authors, he does not like to have any direct relations\r\nwith peasants in the flesh. If he has to speak with them he always feels\r\nawkward, and suffers from the odour of their sheepskins. Ivan Ivan\u0027itch\r\nis ever ready to talk with the peasants, and give them sound, practical\r\nadvice or severe admonitions; and in the old times he was apt, in\r\nmoments of irritation, to supplement his admonitions by a free use of\r\nhis fists. Victor Alexandr\u0027itch, on the contrary, never could give any\r\nadvice except vague commonplace, and as to using his fist, he would have\r\nshrunk from that, not only from respect to humanitarian principles, but\r\nalso from motives which belong to the region of aesthetic sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nThis difference between the two men has an important influence on their\r\npecuniary affairs. The stewards of both steal from their masters; but\r\nthat of Ivan Ivan\u0027itch steals with difficulty, and to a very limited\r\nextent, whereas that of Victor Alexandr\u0027itch steals regularly and\r\nmethodically, and counts his gains, not by kopecks, but by roubles.\r\nThough the two estates are of about the same size and value, they give\r\na very different revenue. The rough, practical man has a much larger\r\nincome than his elegant, well-educated neighbour, and at the same time\r\nspends very much less. The consequences of this, if not at present\r\nvisible, must some day become painfully apparent. Ivan Ivan\u0027itch will\r\ndoubtless leave to his children an unencumbered estate and a certain\r\namount of capital. The children of Victor Alexandr\u0027itch have a different\r\nprospect. He has already begun to mortgage his property and to cut down\r\nthe timber, and he always finds a deficit at the end of the year. What\r\nwill become of his wife and children when the estate comes to be sold\r\nfor payment of the mortgage, it is difficult to predict. He thinks very\r\nlittle of that eventuality, and when his thoughts happen to wander in\r\nthat direction he consoles himself with the thought that before the\r\ncrash comes he will have inherited a fortune from a rich uncle who has\r\nno children.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of the old school lead the same uniform, monotonous life\r\nyear after year, with very little variation. Victor Alexandr\u0027itch,\r\non the contrary, feels the need of a periodical return to \"civilised\r\nsociety,\" and accordingly spends a few weeks every winter in St.\r\nPetersburg. During the summer months he has the society of his\r\nbrother--un homme tout a fait civilise--who possesses an estate a few\r\nmiles off.\r\n\r\nThis brother, Vladimir Alexandr\u0027itch, was educated in the School of Law\r\nin St. Petersburg, and has since risen rapidly in the service. He holds\r\nnow a prominent position in one of the Ministries, and has the honourary\r\ncourt title of \"Chambellan de sa Majeste.\" He is a marked man in the\r\nhigher circles of the Administration, and will, it is thought, some\r\nday become Minister. Though an adherent of enlightened views, and a\r\nprofessed \"Liberal,\" he contrives to keep on very good terms with those\r\nwho imagine themselves to be \"Conservatives.\" In this he is assisted by\r\nhis soft, oily manner. If you express an opinion to him he will always\r\nbegin by telling you that you are quite right; and if he ends by showing\r\nyou that you are quite wrong, he will at least make you feel that your\r\nerror is not only excusable, but in some way highly creditable to your\r\nintellectual acuteness or goodness of heart. In spite of his Liberalism\r\nhe is a staunch Monarchist, and considers that the time has not yet come\r\nfor the Emperor to grant a Constitution. He recognises that the present\r\norder of things has its defects, but thinks that, on the whole, it acts\r\nvery well, and would act much better if certain high officials were\r\nremoved, and more energetic men put in their places. Like all genuine\r\nSt. Petersburg tchinovniks (officials), he has great faith in the\r\nmiraculous power of Imperial ukazes and Ministerial circulars, and\r\nbelieves that national progress consists in multiplying these documents,\r\nand centralising the Administration, so as to give them more effect.\r\nAs a supplementary means of progress he highly approves of aesthetic\r\nculture, and he can speak with some eloquence of the humanising\r\ninfluence of the fine arts. For his own part he is well acquainted with\r\nFrench and English classics, and particularly admires Macaulay, whom\r\nhe declares to have been not only a great writer, but also a great\r\nstatesman. Among writers of fiction he gives the palm to George Eliot,\r\nand speaks of the novelists of his own country, and, indeed, of Russian\r\nliterature as a whole, in the most disparaging terms.\r\n\r\nA very different estimate of Russian literature is held by Alexander\r\nIvan\u0027itch N----, formerly arbiter in peasant affairs, and afterwards\r\njustice of the peace. Discussions on this subject often take place\r\nbetween the two. The admirer of Macaulay declares that Russia has,\r\nproperly speaking, no literature whatever, and that the works which\r\nbear the names of Russian authors are nothing but a feeble echo of the\r\nliterature of Western Europe. \"Imitators,\" he is wont to say, \"skilful\r\nimitators, we have produced in abundance. But where is there a man of\r\noriginal genius? What is our famous poet Zhukofski? A translator. What\r\nis Pushkin? A clever pupil of the romantic school. What is Lermontoff? A\r\nfeeble imitator of Byron. What is Gogol?\"\r\n\r\nAt this point Alexander Ivan\u0027itch invariable intervenes. He is ready to\r\nsacrifice all the pseudo-classic and romantic poetry, and, in fact, the\r\nwhole of Russian literature anterior to about the year 1840, but he will\r\nnot allow anything disrespectful to be said of Gogol, who about that\r\ntime founded the Russian realistic school. \"Gogol,\" he holds, \"was\r\na great and original genius. Gogol not only created a new kind of\r\nliterature; he at the same time transformed the reading public, and\r\ninaugurated a new era in the intellectual development of the nation. By\r\nhis humorous, satirical sketches he swept away the metaphysical dreaming\r\nand foolish romantic affectation then in fashion, and taught men to see\r\ntheir country as it was, in all its hideous ugliness. With his help the\r\nyoung generation perceived the rottenness of the Administration, and\r\nthe meanness, stupidity, dishonesty, and worthlessness of the landed\r\nproprietors, whom he made the special butt of his ridicule. The\r\nrecognition of defects produced a desire for reform. From laughing at\r\nthe proprietors there was but one step to despising them, and when we\r\nlearned to despise the proprietors we naturally came to sympathise with\r\nthe serfs. Thus the Emancipation was prepared by the literature; and\r\nwhen the great question had to be solved, it was the literature that\r\ndiscovered a satisfactory solution.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a subject on which Alexander Ivan\u0027itch feels very strongly, and\r\non which he always speaks with warmth. He knows a good deal regarding\r\nthe intellectual movement which began about 1840, and culminated in\r\nthe great reforms of the sixties. As a University student he troubled\r\nhimself very little with serious academic work, but he read with intense\r\ninterest all the leading periodicals, and adopted the doctrine of\r\nBelinski that art should not be cultivated for its own sake, but should\r\nbe made subservient to social progress. This belief was confirmed by\r\na perusal of some of George Sand\u0027s earlier works, which were for him\r\na kind of revelation. Social questions engrossed his thoughts, and all\r\nother subjects seemed puny by comparison. When the Emancipation question\r\nwas raised he saw an opportunity of applying some of his theories,\r\nand threw himself enthusiastically into the new movement as an ardent\r\nabolitionist. When the law was passed he helped to put it into execution\r\nby serving for three years as an Arbiter of the Peace. Now he is an\r\nold man, but he has preserved some of his youthful enthusiasm, attends\r\nregularly the annual assemblies of the Zemstvo, and takes a lively\r\ninterest in all public affairs.\r\n\r\nAs an ardent partisan of local self-government he habitually scoffs at\r\nthe centralised bureaucracy, which he proclaims to be the great bane of\r\nhis unhappy country. \"These tchinovniks,\" he is wont to say in moments\r\nof excitement, \"who live in St. Petersburg and govern the Empire, know\r\nabout as much of Russia as they do of China. They live in a world of\r\nofficial documents, and are hopelessly ignorant of the real wants and\r\ninterests of the people. So long as all the required formalities are\r\nduly observed they are perfectly satisfied. The people may be allowed\r\nto die of starvation if only the fact do not appear in the official\r\nreports. Powerless to do any good themselves, they are powerful enough\r\nto prevent others from working for the public good, and are extremely\r\njealous of all private initiative. How have they acted, for instance,\r\ntowards the Zemstvo? The Zemstvo is really a good institution, and might\r\nhave done great things if it had been left alone, but as soon as it\r\nbegan to show a little independent energy the officials at once clipped\r\nits wings and then strangled it. Towards the Press they have acted in\r\nthe same way. They are afraid of the Press, because they fear above\r\nall things a healthy public opinion, which the Press alone can create.\r\nEverything that disturbs the habitual routine alarms them. Russia\r\ncannot make any real progress so long as she is ruled by these cursed\r\ntchinovniks.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely less pernicious than the tchinovnik, in the eyes of our\r\nwould-be reformer, is the baritch--that is to say, the pampered,\r\ncapricious, spoiled child of mature years, whose life is spent in\r\nelegant indolence and fine talking. Our friend Victor Alexandr\u0027itch\r\nis commonly selected as a representative of this type. \"Look at him!\"\r\nexclaims Alexander Ivan\u0027itch. \"What a useless, contemptible member of\r\nsociety! In spite of his generous aspirations he never succeeds in doing\r\nanything useful to himself or to others. When the peasant question\r\nwas raised and there was work to be done, he went abroad and talked\r\nliberalism in Paris and Baden-Baden. Though he reads, or at least\r\nprofesses to read, books on agriculture, and is always ready to\r\ndiscourse on the best means of preventing the exhaustion of the soil,\r\nhe knows less of farming than a peasant-boy of twelve, and when he goes\r\ninto the fields he can hardly distinguish rye from oats. Instead of\r\nbabbling about German and Italian music, he would do well to learn a\r\nlittle about practical farming, and look after his estate.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Alexander Ivan\u0027itch thus censures his neighbours, he is himself\r\nnot without detractors. Some staid old proprietors regard him as a\r\ndangerous man, and quote expressions of his which seem to indicate\r\nthat his notions of property are somewhat loose. Many consider that his\r\nliberalism is of a very violent kind, and that he has strong republican\r\nsympathies. In his decisions as Justice he often leaned, it is said,\r\nto the side of the peasants against the proprietors. Then he was always\r\ntrying to induce the peasants of the neighbouring villages to found\r\nschools, and he had wonderful ideas about the best method of teaching\r\nchildren. These and similar facts make many people believe that he has\r\nvery advanced ideas, and one old gentleman habitually calls him--half in\r\njoke and half in earnest--\"our friend the communist.\"\r\n\r\nIn reality Alexander Ivan\u0027itch has nothing of the communist about him.\r\nThough he loudly denounces the tchinovnik spirit--or, as we should\r\nsay, red-tape in all its forms--and is an ardent partisan of local\r\nself-government, he is one of the last men in the world to take part in\r\nany revolutionary movement, he would like to see the Central Government\r\nenlightened and controlled by public opinion and by a national\r\nrepresentation, but he believes that this can only be effected by\r\nvoluntary concessions on the part of the autocratic power. He has,\r\nperhaps, a sentimental love of the peasantry, and is always ready\r\nto advocate its interests; but he has come too much in contact with\r\nindividual peasants to accept those idealised descriptions in which\r\nsome popular writers indulge, and it may safely be asserted that the\r\naccusation of his voluntarily favouring peasants at the expense of the\r\nproprietors is wholly unfounded. Alexander Ivan\u0027itch is, in fact, a\r\nquiet, sensible man, who is capable of generous enthusiasm, and is not\r\nat all satisfied with the existing state of things; but he is not a\r\ndreamer and a revolutionnaire, as some of his neighbours assert.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I cannot say as much for his younger brother Nikolai, who\r\nlives with him. Nikolai Ivan\u0027itch is a tall, slender man, about sixty\r\nyears of age, with emaciated face, bilious complexion and long black\r\nhair--evidently a person of excitable, nervous temperament. When he\r\nspeaks he articulates rapidly, and uses more gesticulation than is\r\ncommon among his countrymen. His favourite subject of conversation, or\r\nrather of discourse, for he more frequently preaches than talks, is the\r\nlamentable state of the country and the worthlessness of the Government.\r\nAgainst the Government he has a great many causes for complaint, and one\r\nor two of a personal kind. In 1861 he was a student in the University of\r\nSt. Petersburg. At that time there was a great deal of public excitement\r\nall over Russia, and especially in the capital. The serfs had just been\r\nemancipated, and other important reforms had been undertaken. There was\r\na general conviction among the young generation--and it must be added\r\namong many older men--that the autocratic, paternal system of government\r\nwas at an end, and that Russia was about to be reorganised according\r\nto the most advanced principles of political and social science.\r\nThe students, sharing this conviction, wished to be freed from\r\nall academical authority, and to organise a kind of academic\r\nself-government. They desired especially the right of holding public\r\nmeetings for the discussion of their common affairs. The authorities\r\nwould not allow this, and issued a list of rules prohibiting meetings\r\nand raising the class-fees, so as practically to exclude many of the\r\npoorer students. This was felt to be a wanton insult to the spirit of\r\nthe new era. In spite of the prohibition, indignation meetings were\r\nheld, and fiery speeches made by male and female orators, first in the\r\nclass-rooms, and afterwards in the courtyard of the University. On one\r\noccasion a long procession marched through the principal streets to the\r\nhouse of the Curator. Never had such a spectacle been seen before in\r\nSt. Petersburg. Timid people feared that it was the commencement of a\r\nrevolution, and dreamed about barricades. At last the authorities took\r\nenergetic measures; about three hundred students were arrested, and of\r\nthese, thirty-two were expelled from the University.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were expelled was Nicolai Ivan\u0027itch. All his hopes of\r\nbecoming a professor, as he had intended, were thereby shipwrecked,\r\nand he had to look out for some other profession. A literary career\r\nnow seemed the most promising, and certainly the most congenial to his\r\ntastes. It would enable him to gratify his ambition of being a\r\npublic man, and give him opportunities of attacking and annoying his\r\npersecutors. He had already written occasionally for one of the leading\r\nperiodicals, and now he became a regular contributor. His stock of\r\npositive knowledge was not very large, but he had the power of writing\r\nfluently and of making his readers believe that he had an unlimited\r\nstore of political wisdom which the Press-censure prevented him from\r\npublishing. Besides this, he had the talent of saying sharp, satirical\r\nthings about those in authority, in such a way that even a Press censor\r\ncould not easily raise objections. Articles written in this style were\r\nsure at that time to be popular, and his had a very great success. He\r\nbecame a known man in literary circles, and for a time all went well.\r\nBut gradually he became less cautious, whilst the authorities became\r\nmore vigilant. Some copies of a violent seditious proclamation fell into\r\nthe hands of the police, and it was generally believed that the document\r\nproceeded from the coterie to which he belonged. From that moment he was\r\ncarefully watched, till one night he was unexpectedly roused from his\r\nsleep by a gendarme and conveyed to the fortress.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is arrested in this way for a real or supposed political\r\noffence, there are two modes of dealing with him. He may be tried\r\nbefore a regular tribunal, or he may be dealt with \"by administrative\r\nprocedure\" (administrativnym poryadkom). In the former case he will, if\r\nconvicted, be condemned to imprisonment for a certain term; or, if the\r\noffence be of a graver nature, he may be transported to Siberia either\r\nfor a fixed period or for life. By the administrative procedure he is\r\nsimply removed without a trial to some distant town, and compelled\r\nto live there under police supervision during his Majesty\u0027s pleasure.\r\nNikolai Ivan\u0027itch was treated \"administratively,\" because the\r\nauthorities, though convinced that he was a dangerous character, could\r\nnot find sufficient evidence to procure his conviction before a court\r\nof justice. For five years he lived under police supervision in a small\r\ntown near the White Sea, and then one day he was informed, without any\r\nexplanation, that he might go and live anywhere he pleased except in St.\r\nPetersburg and Moscow.\r\n\r\nSince that time he has lived with his brother, and spends his time in\r\nbrooding over his grievances and bewailing his shattered illusions. He\r\nhas lost none of that fluency which gained him an ephemeral literary\r\nreputation, and can speak by the hour on political and social questions\r\nto any one who will listen to him. It is extremely difficult, however,\r\nto follow his discourses, and utterly impossible to retain them in the\r\nmemory. They belong to what may be called political metaphysics--for\r\nthough he professes to hold metaphysics in abhorrence, he is himself a\r\nthorough metaphysician in his modes of thought. He lives, indeed, in\r\na world of abstract conceptions, in which he can scarcely perceive\r\nconcrete facts, and his arguments are always a kind of clever juggling\r\nwith such equivocal, conventional terms as aristocracy, bourgeoisie,\r\nmonarchy, and the like. At concrete facts he arrives, not directly by\r\nobservation, but by deductions from general principles, so that his\r\nfacts can never by any possibility contradict his theories. Then he has\r\ncertain axioms which he tacitly assumes, and on which all his arguments\r\nare based; as, for instance, that everything to which the term \"liberal\"\r\ncan be applied must necessarily be good at all times and under all\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAmong a mass of vague conceptions which it is impossible to reduce\r\nto any clearly defined form he has a few ideas which are perhaps not\r\nstrictly true, but which are at least intelligible. Among these is\r\nhis conviction that Russia has let slip a magnificent opportunity of\r\ndistancing all Europe on the road of progress. She might, he thinks, at\r\nthe time of the Emancipation, have boldly accepted all the most\r\nadvanced principles of political and social science, and have completely\r\nreorganised the political and social structure in accordance with them.\r\nOther nations could not take such a step, because they are old and\r\ndecrepit, filled with stubborn, hereditary prejudices, and cursed with\r\nan aristocracy and a bourgeoisie; but Russia is young, knows nothing of\r\nsocial castes, and has no deep-rooted prejudices to contend with. The\r\npopulation is like potter\u0027s clay, which can be made to assume any\r\nform that science may recommend. Alexander II. began a magnificent\r\nsociological experiment, but he stopped half-way.\r\n\r\nSome day, he believes, the experiment will be completed, but not by the\r\nautocratic power. In his opinion autocracy is \"played out,\" and must\r\ngive way to Parliamentary institutions. For him a Constitution is a kind\r\nof omnipotent fetish. You may try to explain to him that a Parliamentary\r\nregime, whatever its advantages may be, necessarily produces political\r\nparties and political conflicts, and is not nearly so suitable for grand\r\nsociological experiments as a good paternal despotism. You may try to\r\nconvince him that, though it may be difficult to convert an autocrat, it\r\nis infinitely more difficult to convert a House of Commons. But all your\r\nefforts will be in vain. He will assure you that a Russian Parliament\r\nwould be something quite different from what Parliaments commonly are.\r\nIt would contain no parties, for Russia has no social castes, and would\r\nbe guided entirely by scientific considerations--as free from prejudice\r\nand personal influences as a philosopher speculating on the nature of\r\nthe Infinite! In short, he evidently imagines that a national Parliament\r\nwould be composed of himself and his friends, and that the nation would\r\ncalmly submit to their ukazes, as it has hitherto submitted to the\r\nukazes of the Tsars.\r\n\r\nPending the advent of this political Millennium, when unimpassioned\r\nscience is to reign supreme, Nikolai Ivan\u0027itch allows himself the luxury\r\nof indulging in some very decided political animosities, and he hates\r\nwith the fervour of a fanatic. Firstly and chiefly, he hates what he\r\ncalls the bourgeoisie--he is obliged to use the French word, because\r\nhis native language does not contain an equivalent term--and especially\r\ncapitalists of all sorts and dimensions. Next, he hates aristocracy,\r\nespecially a form of aristocracy called Feudalism. To these abstract\r\nterms he does not attach a very precise meaning, but he hates the\r\nentities which they are supposed to represent quite as heartily as if\r\nthey were personal enemies. Among the things which he hates in his\r\nown country, the Autocratic Power holds the first place. Next, as\r\nan emanation from the Autocratic Power, come the tchinovniks, and\r\nespecially the gendarmes. Then come the landed proprietors. Though he\r\nis himself a landed proprietor, he regards the class as cumberers of\r\nthe ground, and thinks that all their land should be confiscated and\r\ndistributed among the peasantry.\r\n\r\nAll proprietors have the misfortune to come under his sweeping\r\ndenunciations, because they are inconsistent with his ideal of a peasant\r\nEmpire, but he recognises amongst them degrees of depravity. Some are\r\nsimply obstructive, whilst others are actively prejudicial to the public\r\nwelfare. Among these latter a special object of aversion is Prince\r\nS----, because he not only possesses very large estates, but at the same\r\ntime has aristocratic pretensions, and calls himself Conservative.\r\n\r\nPrince S---- is by far the most important man in the district. His\r\nfamily is one of the oldest in the country, but he does not owe his\r\ninfluence to his pedigree, for pedigree pure and simple does not count\r\nfor much in Russia. He is influential and respected because he is a\r\ngreat land-holder with a high official position, and belongs by birth\r\nto that group of families which forms the permanent nucleus of the\r\never-changing Court society. His father and grandfather were important\r\npersonages in the Administration and at Court, and his sons and\r\ngrandsons will probably in this respect follow in the footsteps of\r\ntheir ancestors. Though in the eye of the law all nobles are equal,\r\nand, theoretically speaking, promotion is gained exclusively by personal\r\nmerit, yet, in reality, those who have friends at Court rise more easily\r\nand more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has had a prosperous but not very eventful life. He was\r\neducated, first at home, under an English tutor, and afterwards in the\r\nCorps des Pages. On leaving this institution he entered a regiment\r\nof the Guards, and rose steadily to high military rank. His activity,\r\nhowever, has been chiefly in the civil administration, and he now has\r\na seat in the Council of State. Though he has always taken a certain\r\ninterest in public affairs, he did not play an important part in any of\r\nthe great reforms. When the peasant question was raised he sympathised\r\nwith the idea of Emancipation, but did not at all sympathise with the\r\nidea of giving land to the emancipated serfs and preserving the Communal\r\ninstitutions. What he desired was that the proprietors should liberate\r\ntheir serfs without any pecuniary indemnity, and should receive in\r\nreturn a certain share of political power. His scheme was not adopted,\r\nbut he has not relinquished the hope that the great landed proprietors\r\nmay somehow obtain a social and political position similar to that of\r\nthe great land-owners in England.\r\n\r\nOfficial duties and social relations compel the Prince to live for a\r\nlarge part of the year in the capital. He spends only a few weeks yearly\r\non his estate. The house is large, and fitted up in the English style,\r\nwith a view to combining elegance and comfort. It contains several\r\nspacious apartments, a library, and a billiard-room. There is an\r\nextensive park, an immense garden with hot houses, numerous horses and\r\ncarriages, and a legion of servants. In the drawing-room is a plentiful\r\nsupply of English and French books, newspapers, and periodicals,\r\nincluding the Journal de St. Petersbourg, which gives the news of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe family have, in short, all the conveniences and comforts which money\r\nand refinement can procure, but it cannot be said that they greatly\r\nenjoy the time spent in the country. The Princess has no decided\r\nobjection to it. She is devoted to a little grandchild, is fond of\r\nreading and correspondence, amuses herself with a school and hospital\r\nwhich she has founded for the peasantry, and occasionally drives over to\r\nsee her friend, the Countess N----, who lives about fifteen miles off.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, however, finds country life excessively dull. He does not\r\ncare for riding or shooting, and he finds nothing else to do. He knows\r\nnothing about the management of his estate, and holds consultations\r\nwith the steward merely pro forma--this estate and the others which he\r\npossesses in different provinces being ruled by a head-steward in St.\r\nPetersburg, in whom he has the most complete confidence. In the vicinity\r\nthere is no one with whom he cares to associate. Naturally he is not a\r\nsociable man, and he has acquired a stiff, formal, reserved manner\r\nthat is rarely met with in Russia. This manner repels the neighbouring\r\nproprietors--a fact that he does not at all regret, for they do not\r\nbelong to his monde, and they have in their manners and habits a\r\nfree-and-easy rusticity which is positively disagreeable to him. His\r\nrelations with them are therefore confined to formal calls. The greater\r\npart of the day he spends in listless loitering, frequently yawning,\r\nregretting the routine of St. Petersburg life--the pleasant chats with\r\nhis colleagues, the opera, the ballet, the French theatre, and the quiet\r\nrubber at the Club Anglais. His spirits rise as the day of his departure\r\napproaches, and when he drives off to the station he looks bright and\r\ncheerful. If he consulted merely his own tastes he would never visit his\r\nestates at all, and would spend his summer holidays in Germany, France,\r\nor Switzerland, as he did in his bachelor days; but as a large landowner\r\nhe considers it right to sacrifice his personal inclinations to the\r\nduties of his position.\r\n\r\nThere is, by the way, another princely magnate in the district, and\r\nI ought perhaps to introduce him to my readers, because he represents\r\nworthily a new type. Like Prince S----, of whom I have just spoken, he\r\nis a great land-owner and a descendant of the half-mythical Rurik; but\r\nhe has no official rank, and does not possess a single grand cordon.\r\nIn that respect he has followed in the footsteps of his father and\r\ngrandfather, who had something of the frondeur spirit, and preferred\r\nthe position of a grand seigneur and a country gentleman to that of\r\na tchinovnik and a courtier. In the Liberal camp he is regarded as\r\na Conservative, but he has little in common with the Krepostnik, who\r\ndeclares that the reforms of the last half-century were a mistake,\r\nthat everything is going to the bad, that the emancipated serfs are all\r\nsluggards, drunkards, and thieves, that the local self-government is an\r\ningenious machine for wasting money, and that the reformed law-courts\r\nhave conferred benefits only on the lawyers. On the contrary, he\r\nrecognises the necessity and beneficent results of the reforms, and\r\nwith regard to the future he has none of the despairing pessimism of the\r\nincorrigible old Tory.\r\n\r\nBut in order that real progress should be made, he thinks that certain\r\ncurrent and fashionable errors must be avoided, and among these errors\r\nhe places, in the first rank, the views and principles of the advanced\r\nLiberals, who have a blind admiration for Western Europe, and for what\r\nthey are pleased to call the results of science. Like the Liberals of\r\nthe West, these gentlemen assume that the best form of government is\r\nconstitutionalism, monarchical or republican, on a broad democratic\r\nbasis, and towards the realisation of this ideal all their efforts\r\nare directed. Not so our Conservative friend. While admitting that\r\ndemocratic Parliamentary institutions may be the best form of government\r\nfor the more advanced nations of the West, he maintains that the only\r\nfirm foundation for the Russian Empire, and the only solid guarantee\r\nof its future prosperity, is the Autocratic Power, which is the sole\r\ngenuine representative of the national spirit. Looking at the past from\r\nthis point of view, he perceives that the Tsars have ever identified\r\nthemselves with the nation, and have always understood, in part\r\ninstinctively and in part by reflection, what the nation really\r\nrequired. Whenever the infiltration of Western ideas threatened to swamp\r\nthe national individuality, the Autocratic Power intervened and averted\r\nthe danger by timely precautions. Something of the kind may be observed,\r\nhe believes, at present, when the Liberals are clamouring for a\r\nParliament and a Constitution; but the Autocratic Power is on the alert,\r\nand is making itself acquainted with the needs of the people by means\r\nfar more effectual than could be supplied by oratorical politicians.\r\n\r\nWith the efforts of the Zemstvo in this direction, and with the activity\r\nof the Zemstvo generally, the Prince has little sympathy, partly because\r\nthe institution is in the hands of the Liberals and is guided by\r\ntheir unpractical ideas, and partly because it enables some ambitious\r\noutsiders to acquire the influence in local affairs which ought to be\r\nexercised by the old-established noble families of the neighbourhood.\r\nWhat he would like to see is an enlightened, influential gentry working\r\nin conjunction with the Autocratic Power for the good of the country. If\r\nRussia could produce a few hundred thousand men like himself, his ideal\r\nmight perhaps be realised. For the present, such men are extremely\r\nrare--I should have difficulty in naming a dozen of them--and\r\naristocratic ideas are extremely unpopular among the great majority of\r\nthe educated classes. When a Russian indulges in political speculation,\r\nhe is pretty sure to show himself thoroughly democratic, with a strong\r\nleaning to socialism.\r\n\r\nThe Prince belongs to the highest rank of the Russian Noblesse. If we\r\nwish to get an idea of the lowest rank, we can find in the neighbourhood\r\na number of poor, uneducated men, who live in small, squalid houses, and\r\nare not easily to be distinguished from peasants. They are nobles, like\r\nhis Highness; but, unlike him, they enjoy no social consideration,\r\nand their landed property consists of a few acres of land which barely\r\nsupply them with the first necessaries of life. If we went to other\r\nparts of the country we might find men in this condition bearing the\r\ntitle of Prince! This is the natural result of the Russian law of\r\ninheritance, which does not recognise the principle of primogeniture\r\nwith regard to titles and estates. All the sons of a Prince are Princes,\r\nand at his death his property, movable and immovable, is divided amongst\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CLASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Social Classes or Castes Exist in Russia?--Well-marked Social\r\nTypes--Classes Recognised by the Legislation and the Official\r\nStatistics--Origin and Gradual Formation of these Classes--Peculiarity\r\nin the Historical Development of Russia--Political Life and Political\r\nParties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages I have repeatedly used the expression \"social\r\nclasses,\" and probably more than once the reader has felt inclined to\r\nask, What are social classes in the Russian sense of the term? It may be\r\nwell, therefore, before going farther, to answer this question.\r\n\r\nIf the question were put to a Russian it is not at all unlikely that\r\nhe would reply somewhat in this fashion: \"In Russia there are no social\r\nclasses, and there never have been any. That fact constitutes one of the\r\nmost striking peculiarities of her historical development, and one of\r\nthe surest foundations of her future greatness. We know nothing,\r\nand have never known anything, of those class distinctions and class\r\nenmities which in Western Europe have often rudely shaken society in\r\npast times, and imperil its existence in the future.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement will not be readily accepted by the traveller who visits\r\nRussia with no preconceived ideas and forms his opinions from his own\r\nobservations. To him it seems that class distinctions form one of the\r\nmost prominent characteristics of Russian society. In a few days he\r\nlearns to distinguish the various classes by their outward appearance.\r\nHe easily recognises the French-speaking nobles in West-European\r\ncostume; the burly, bearded merchant in black cloth cap and long, shiny,\r\ndouble-breasted coat; the priest with his uncut hair and flowing robes;\r\nthe peasant with his full, fair beard and unsavoury, greasy sheepskin.\r\nMeeting everywhere those well-marked types, he naturally assumes\r\nthat Russian society is composed of exclusive castes; and this first\r\nimpression will be fully confirmed by a glance at the Code. On examining\r\nthat monumental work, he finds that an entire volume--and by no means\r\nthe smallest--is devoted to the rights and obligations of the various\r\nclasses. From this he concludes that the classes have a legal as well as\r\nan actual existence. To make assurance doubly sure he turns to official\r\nstatistics, and there he finds the following table:\r\n\r\n     Hereditary nobles........652,887\r\n     Personal nobles..........374,367\r\n     Clerical classes.........695,905\r\n     Town classes...........7,196,005\r\n     Rural classes.........63,840,291\r\n     Military classes.......4,767,703\r\n     Foreigners...............153,185\r\n     ----------                      77,680,293*\r\n\r\n\r\n     * Livron: \"Statistitcheskoe Obozrenie Rossiiskoi Imperii,\"\r\n     St. Petersburg, 1875.  The above figures include the whole\r\n     Empire.  The figures according to the latest census (1897)\r\n     are not yet available.\r\n\r\nArmed with these materials, the traveller goes to his Russian friends\r\nwho have assured him that their country knows nothing of class\r\ndistinctions. He is confident of being able to convince them that\r\nthey have been labouring under a strange delusion, but he will be\r\ndisappointed. They will tell him that these laws and statistics\r\nprove nothing, and that the categories therein mentioned are mere\r\nadministrative fictions.\r\n\r\nThis apparent contradiction is to be explained by the equivocal meaning\r\nof the Russian terms Sosloviya and Sostoyaniya, which are commonly\r\ntranslated \"social classes.\" If by these terms are meant \"castes\" in\r\nthe Oriental sense, then it may be confidently asserted that such do not\r\nexist in Russia. Between the nobles, the clergy, the burghers, and the\r\npeasants there are no distinctions of race and no impassable barriers.\r\nThe peasant often becomes a merchant, and there are many cases on record\r\nof peasants and sons of parish priests becoming nobles. Until very\r\nrecently the parish clergy composed, as we have seen, a peculiar and\r\nexclusive class, with many of the characteristics of a caste; but this\r\nhas been changed, and it may now be said that in Russia there are no\r\ncastes in the Oriental sense.\r\n\r\nIf the word Sosloviya be taken to mean an organised political unit\r\nwith an esprit de corps and a clearly conceived political aim, it may\r\nlikewise be admitted that there are none in Russia. As there has been\r\nfor centuries no political life among the subjects of the Tsars, there\r\nhave been no political parties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to say that social classes have never existed in\r\nRussia and that the categories which appear in the legislation and in\r\nthe official statistics are mere administrative fictions, is a piece of\r\ngross exaggeration.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of Russian history we can detect unmistakably\r\nthe existence of social classes, such as the Princes, the Boyars, the\r\narmed followers of the Princes, the peasantry, the slaves, and various\r\nothers; and one of the oldest legal documents which we possess--the\r\n\"Russian Right\" (Russkaya Pravda) of the Grand Prince Yaroslaff\r\n(1019-1054)--contains irrefragable proof, in the penalties attached\r\nto various crimes, that these classes were formally recognised by\r\nthe legislation. Since that time they have frequently changed their\r\ncharacter, but they have never at any period ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, when there was very little administrative regulation,\r\nthe classes had perhaps no clearly defined boundaries, and the\r\npeculiarities which distinguished them from each other were actual\r\nrather than legal--lying in the mode of life and social position rather\r\nthan in peculiar obligations and privileges. But as the autocratic power\r\ndeveloped and strove to transform the nation into a State with a highly\r\ncentralised administration, the legal element in the social distinctions\r\nbecame more and more prominent. For financial and other purposes\r\nthe people had to be divided into various categories. The actual\r\ndistinctions were of course taken as the basis of the legal\r\nclassification, but the classifying had more than a merely formal\r\nsignificance. The necessity of clearly defining the different groups\r\nentailed the necessity of elevating and strengthening the barriers which\r\nalready existed between them, and the difficulty of passing from one\r\ngroup to another was thereby increased.\r\n\r\nIn this work of classification Peter the Great especially distinguished\r\nhimself. With his insatiable passion for regulation, he raised\r\nformidable barriers between the different categories, and defined the\r\nobligations of each with microscopic minuteness. After his death the\r\nwork was carried on in the same spirit, and the tendency reached its\r\nclimax in the reign of Nicholas, when the number of students to be\r\nreceived in the universities was determined by Imperial ukaz!\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Catherine a new element was introduced into the official\r\nconception of social classes. Down to her time the Government had\r\nthought merely of class obligations; under the influence of Western\r\nideas she introduced the conception of class rights. She wished, as we\r\nhave seen, to have in her Empire a Noblesse and tiers-etat like those\r\nwhich existed in France, and for this purpose she granted, first to the\r\nDvoryanstvo and afterwards to the towns, an Imperial Charter, or Bill\r\nof Rights. Succeeding sovereigns have acted in the same spirit, and the\r\nCode now confers on each class numerous privileges as well as numerous\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThus, we see, the oft-repeated assertion that the Russian social classes\r\nare simply artificial categories created by the legislature is to a\r\ncertain extent true, but is by no means accurate. The social groups,\r\nsuch as peasants, landed proprietors, and the like, came into existence\r\nin Russia, as in other countries, by the simple force of circumstances.\r\nThe legislature merely recognised and developed the social distinctions\r\nwhich already existed. The legal status, obligations, and rights of each\r\ngroup were minutely defined and regulated, and legal barriers were added\r\nto the actual barriers which separated the groups from each other.\r\n\r\nWhat is peculiar in the historical development of Russia is this: until\r\nlately she remained an almost exclusively agricultural Empire with\r\nabundance of unoccupied land. Her history presents, therefore, few of\r\nthose conflicts which result from the variety of social conditions and\r\nthe intensified struggle for existence. Certain social groups were,\r\nindeed, formed in the course of time, but they were never allowed to\r\nfight out their own battles. The irresistible autocratic power kept them\r\nalways in check and fashioned them into whatever form it thought proper,\r\ndefining minutely and carefully their obligations, their rights, their\r\nmutual relations, and their respective positions in the political\r\norganisation. Hence we find in the history of Russia almost no trace\r\nof those class hatreds which appear so conspicuously in the history of\r\nWestern Europe.*\r\n\r\n     * This is, I believe, the true explanation of an important\r\n     fact, which the Slavophils endeavoured to explain by an\r\n     ill-authenticated legend (vide supra p.151).\r\n\r\nThe practical consequence of all this is that in Russia at the present\r\nday there is very little caste spirit or caste prejudice. Within\r\nhalf-a-dozen years after the emancipation of the serfs, proprietors and\r\npeasants, forgetting apparently their old relationship of master and\r\nserf, were working amicably together in the new local administration,\r\nand not a few similar curious facts might be cited. The confident\r\nanticipation of many Russians that their country will one day enjoy\r\npolitical life without political parties is, if not a contradiction\r\nin terms, at least a Utopian absurdity; but we may be sure that when\r\npolitical parties do appear they will be very different from those which\r\nexist in Germany, France, and England.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, let us see how the country is governed without political\r\nparties and without political life in the West-European sense of the\r\nterm. This will form the subject of our next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL ADMINISTRATION AND THE OFFICIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Officials in Norgorod Assist Me in My Studies--The Modern Imperial\r\nAdministration Created by Peter the Great, and Developed by his\r\nSuccessors--A Slavophil\u0027s View of the Administration--The Administration\r\nBriefly Described--The Tchinovniks, or Officials--Official Titles, and\r\nTheir Real Significance--What the Administration Has Done for Russia in\r\nthe Past--Its Character Determined by the Peculiar Relation between\r\nthe Government and the People--Its Radical Vices--Bureaucratic\r\nRemedies--Complicated Formal Procedure--The Gendarmerie: My Personal\r\nRelations with this Branch of the Administration; Arrest and Release--A\r\nStrong, Healthy Public Opinion the Only Effectual Remedy for Bad\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy administrative studies were begun in Novgorod. One of my reasons for\r\nspending a winter in that provincial capital was that I might study the\r\nprovincial administration, and as soon as I had made the acquaintance of\r\nthe leading officials I explained to them the object I had in view. With\r\nthe kindly bonhomie which distinguishes the Russian educated classes,\r\nthey all volunteered to give me every assistance in their power, but\r\nsome of them, on mature reflection, evidently saw reason to check their\r\nfirst generous impulse. Among these was the Vice-Governor, a gentleman\r\nof German origin, and therefore more inclined to be pedantic than a\r\ngenuine Russian. When I called on him one evening and reminded him of\r\nhis friendly offer, I found to my surprise that he had in the meantime\r\nchanged his mind. Instead of answering my first simple inquiry, he\r\nstared at me fixedly, as if for the purpose of detecting some covert,\r\nmalicious design, and then, putting on an air of official dignity,\r\ninformed me that as I had not been authorised by the Minister to make\r\nthese investigations, he could not assist me, and would certainly not\r\nallow me to examine the archives.\r\n\r\nThis was not encouraging, but it did not prevent me from applying to the\r\nGovernor, and I found him a man of a very different stamp. Delighted to\r\nmeet a foreigner who seemed anxious to study seriously in an unbiassed\r\nframe of mind the institutions of his much-maligned native country, he\r\nwillingly explained to me the mechanism of the administration which he\r\ndirected and controlled, and kindly placed at my disposal the books and\r\ndocuments in which I could find the historical and practical information\r\nwhich I required.\r\n\r\nThis friendly attitude of his Excellency towards me soon became\r\ngenerally known in the town, and from that moment my difficulties were\r\nat an end. The minor officials no longer hesitated to initiate me into\r\nthe mysteries of their respective departments, and at last even the\r\nVice-Governor threw off his reserve and followed the example of his\r\ncolleagues. The elementary information thus acquired I had afterwards\r\nabundant opportunities of completing by observation and study in other\r\nparts of the Empire, and I now propose to communicate to the reader a\r\nfew of the more general results.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic administrative machine which holds together all the various\r\nparts of the vast Empire has been gradually created by successive\r\ngenerations, but we may say roughly that it was first designed and\r\nconstructed by Peter the Great. Before his time the country was governed\r\nin a rude, primitive fashion. The Grand Princes of Moscow, in subduing\r\ntheir rivals and annexing the surrounding principalities, merely cleared\r\nthe ground for a great homogeneous State. Wily, practical politicians,\r\nrather than statesmen of the doctrinaire type, they never dreamed of\r\nintroducing uniformity and symmetry into the administration as a whole.\r\nThey developed the ancient institutions so far as these were useful and\r\nconsistent with the exercise of autocratic power, and made only such\r\nalterations as practical necessity demanded. And these necessary\r\nalterations were more frequently local than general. Special decisions,\r\ninstruction to particular officials, and charters for particular\r\ncommunes of proprietors were much more common than general legislative\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nIn short, the old Muscovite Tsars practised a hand-to-mouth policy,\r\ndestroying whatever caused temporary inconvenience, and giving little\r\nheed to what did not force itself upon their attention. Hence,\r\nunder their rule the administration presented not only territorial\r\npeculiarities, but also an ill-assorted combination of different systems\r\nin the same district--a conglomeration of institutions belonging to\r\ndifferent epochs, like a fleet composed of triremes, three-deckers, and\r\niron-clads.\r\n\r\nThis irregular system, or rather want of system, seemed highly\r\nunsatisfactory to the logical mind of Peter the Great, and he conceived\r\nthe grand design of sweeping it away, and putting in its place a\r\nsymmetrical bureaucratic machine. It is scarcely necessary to say\r\nthat this magnificent project, so foreign to the traditional ideas and\r\ncustoms of the people, was not easily realised. Imagine a man, without\r\ntechnical knowledge, without skilled workmen, without good tools, and\r\nwith no better material than soft, crumbling sandstone, endeavouring\r\nto build a palace on a marsh! The undertaking would seem to reasonable\r\nminds utterly absurd, and yet it must be admitted that Peter\u0027s project\r\nwas scarcely more feasible. He had neither technical knowledge, nor the\r\nrequisite materials, nor a firm foundation to build on. With his usual\r\nTitanic energy he demolished the old structure, but his attempts to\r\nconstruct were little more than a series of failures. In his numerous\r\nukazes he has left us a graphic description of his efforts, and it is\r\nat once instructive and pathetic to watch the great worker toiling\r\nindefatigably at his self-imposed task. His instruments are constantly\r\nbreaking in his hands. The foundations of the building are continually\r\ngiving way, and the lower tiers crumbling under the superincumbent\r\nweight. Now and then a whole section is found to be unsuitable, and is\r\nruthlessly pulled down, or falls of its own accord. And yet the builder\r\ntoils on, with a perseverance and an energy of purpose that compel\r\nadmiration, frankly confessing his mistakes and failures, and\r\npatiently seeking the means of remedying them, never allowing a word of\r\ndespondency to escape him, and never despairing of ultimate success. And\r\nat length death comes, and the mighty builder is snatched away suddenly\r\nin the midst of his unfinished labours, bequeathing to his successors\r\nthe task of carrying on the great work.\r\n\r\nNone of these successors possessed Peter\u0027s genius and energy--with the\r\nexception perhaps of Catherine II.--but they were all compelled by\r\nthe force of circumstances to adopt his plans. A return to the old\r\nrough-and-ready rule of the local Voyevods was impossible. As the\r\nAutocratic Power became more and more imbued with Western ideas, it\r\nfelt more and more the need of new means for carrying them out, and\r\naccordingly it strove to systematise and centralise the administration.\r\n\r\nIn this change we may perceive a certain analogy with the history of the\r\nFrench administration from the reign of Philippe le Bel to that of\r\nLouis XIV. In both countries we see the central power bringing the local\r\nadministrative organs more and more under its control, till at last it\r\nsucceeds in creating a thoroughly centralised bureaucratic organisation.\r\nBut under this superficial resemblance lie profound differences. The\r\nFrench kings had to struggle with provincial sovereignties and feudal\r\nrights, and when they had annihilated this opposition they easily found\r\nmaterials with which to build up the bureaucratic structure. The Russian\r\nsovereigns, on the contrary, met with no such opposition, but they\r\nhad great difficulty in finding bureaucratic material amongst their\r\nuneducated, undisciplined subjects, notwithstanding the numerous schools\r\nand colleges which were founded and maintained simply for the purpose of\r\npreparing men for the public service.\r\n\r\nThe administration was thus brought much nearer to the West-European\r\nideal, but some people have grave doubts as to whether it became thereby\r\nbetter adapted to the practical wants of the people for whom it was\r\ncreated. On this point a well-known Slavophil once made to me some\r\nremarks which are worthy of being recorded. \"You have observed,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that till very recently there was in Russia an enormous amount\r\nof official peculation, extortion, and misgovernment of every kind, that\r\nthe courts of law were dens of iniquity, that the people often committed\r\nperjury, and much more of the same sort, and it must be admitted that\r\nall this has not yet entirely disappeared. But what does it prove? That\r\nthe Russian people are morally inferior to the German? Not at all. It\r\nsimply proves that the German system of administration, which was forced\r\nupon them without their consent, was utterly unsuited to their nature.\r\nIf a young growing boy be compelled to wear very tight boots, he will\r\nprobably burst them, and the ugly rents will doubtless produce an\r\nunfavourable impression on the passers-by; but surely it is better that\r\nthe boots should burst than that the feet should be deformed. Now, the\r\nRussian people was compelled to put on not only tight boots, but also\r\na tight jacket, and, being young and vigorous, it burst them.\r\nNarrow-minded, pedantic Germans can neither understand nor provide for\r\nthe wants of the broad Slavonic nature.\"\r\n\r\nIn its present form the Russian administration seems at first sight a\r\nvery imposing edifice. At the top of the pyramid stands the Emperor,\r\n\"the autocratic monarch,\" as Peter the Great described him, \"who has\r\nto give an account of his acts to no one on earth, but has power\r\nand authority to rule his States and lands as a Christian sovereign\r\naccording to his own will and judgment.\" Immediately below the Emperor\r\nwe see the Council of State, the Committee of Ministers, and the Senate,\r\nwhich represent respectively the legislative, the administrative, and\r\nthe judicial power. An Englishman glancing over the first volume of the\r\ngreat Code of Laws might imagine that the Council of State is a kind of\r\nParliament, and the Committee of Ministers a cabinet in our sense of the\r\nterm, but in reality both institutions are simply incarnations of the\r\nAutocratic Power. Though the Council is entrusted by law with many\r\nimportant functions--such as discussing Bills, criticising the annual\r\nbudget, declaring war and concluding peace--it has merely a consultative\r\ncharacter, and the Emperor is not in any way bound by its decisions.\r\nThe Committee is not at all a cabinet as we understand the word. The\r\nMinisters are directly and individually responsible to the Emperor, and\r\ntherefore the Committee has no common responsibility or other cohesive\r\nforce. As to the Senate, it has descended from its high estate. It\r\nwas originally entrusted with the supreme power during the absence or\r\nminority of the monarch, and was intended to exercise a controlling\r\ninfluence in all sections of the administration, but now its activity\r\nis restricted to judicial matters, and it is little more than a supreme\r\ncourt of appeal.\r\n\r\nImmediately below these three institutions stand the Ministries, ten in\r\nnumber. They are the central points in which converge the various kinds\r\nof territorial administration, and from which radiates the Imperial will\r\nall over the Empire.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of territorial administration Russia proper--that is to\r\nsay, European Russia, exclusive of Poland, the Baltic Provinces, Finland\r\nand the Caucasus--is divided into forty-nine provinces or \"Governments\"\r\n(gubernii), and each Government is subdivided into Districts (uyezdi).\r\nThe average area of a province is about the size of Portugal, but some\r\nare as small as Belgium, whilst one at least is twenty-five times as\r\nbig. The population, however, does not correspond to the amount of\r\nterritory. In the largest province, that of Archangel, there are only\r\nabout 350,000 inhabitants, whilst in two of the smaller ones there are\r\nover three millions. The districts likewise vary greatly in size. Some\r\nare smaller than Oxfordshire or Buckingham, and others are bigger than\r\nthe whole of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOver each province is placed a Governor, who is assisted in his duties\r\nby a Vice-Governor and a small council. According to the legislation\r\nof Catherine II., which still appears in the Code and has only\r\nbeen partially repealed, the Governor is termed \"the steward of the\r\nprovince,\" and is entrusted with so many and such delicate duties, that\r\nin order to obtain qualified men for the post it would be necessary to\r\nrealise the great Empress\u0027s design of creating, by education, \"a new\r\nrace of people.\" Down to the time of the Crimean War the Governors\r\nunderstood the term \"stewards\" in a very literal sense, and ruled in\r\na most arbitrary, high-handed style, often exercising an important\r\ninfluence on the civil and criminal tribunals. These extensive and\r\nvaguely defined powers have now been very much curtailed, partly by\r\npositive legislation, and partly by increased publicity and improved\r\nmeans of communication. All judicial matters have been placed\r\ntheoretically beyond the Governor\u0027s control, and many of his former\r\nfunctions are now fulfilled by the Zemstvo--the new organ of local\r\nself-government. Besides this, all ordinary current affairs are\r\nregulated by an already big and ever-growing body of instructions, in\r\nthe form of Imperial orders and ministerial circulars, and as soon as\r\nanything not provided for by the instructions happens to occur, the\r\nminister is consulted through the post-office or by telegraph.\r\n\r\nEven within the sphere of their lawful authority the Governors have now\r\na certain respect for public opinion and occasionally a very wholesome\r\ndread of casual newspaper correspondents. Thus the men who were formerly\r\ndescribed by the satirists as \"little satraps\" have sunk to the level\r\nof subordinate officials. I can confidently say that many (I believe the\r\nmajority) of them are honest, upright men, who are perhaps not endowed\r\nwith any unusual administrative capacities, but who perform their duties\r\nfaithfully according to their lights. If any representatives of the old\r\n\"satraps\" still exist, they must be sought for in the outlying Asiatic\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the Governor, who is the local representative of the\r\nMinistry of the Interior, are a number of resident officials, who\r\nrepresent the other ministries, and each of them has a bureau, with the\r\nrequisite number of assistants, secretaries, and scribes.\r\n\r\nTo keep this vast and complex bureaucratic machine in motion it is\r\nnecessary to have a large and well-drilled army of officials. These are\r\ndrawn chiefly from the ranks of the Noblesse and the clergy, and form\r\na peculiar social class called Tchinovniks, or men with Tchins. As the\r\nTchin plays an important part in Russia, not only in the official world,\r\nbut also to some extent in social life, it may be well to explain its\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nAll offices, civil and military, are, according to a scheme invented\r\nby Peter the Great, arranged in fourteen classes or ranks, and to each\r\nclass or rank a particular name is attached. As promotion is supposed\r\nto be given according to personal merit, a man who enters the public\r\nservice for the first time must, whatever be his social position, begin\r\nin the lower ranks, and work his way upwards. Educational certificates\r\nmay exempt him from the necessity of passing through the lowest classes,\r\nand the Imperial will may disregard the restrictions laid down by\r\nlaw; but as general rule a man must begin at or near the bottom of the\r\nofficial ladder, and he must remain on each step a certain specified\r\ntime. The step on which he is for the moment standing, or, in other\r\nwords, the official rank or tchin which he possesses determines what\r\noffices he is competent to hold. Thus rank or tchin is a necessary\r\ncondition for receiving an appointment, but it does not designate any\r\nactual office, and the names of the different ranks are extremely apt to\r\nmislead a foreigner.\r\n\r\nWe must always bear this in mind when we meet with those imposing titles\r\nwhich Russian tourists sometimes put on their visiting cards, such as\r\n\"Conseiller de Cour,\" \"Conseiller d\u0027Etat,\" \"Conseiller prive de S. M.\r\nl\u0027Empereur de toutes les Russies.\" It would be uncharitable to suppose\r\nthat these titles are used with the intention of misleading, but that\r\nthey do sometimes mislead there cannot be the least doubt. I shall never\r\nforget the look of intense disgust which I once saw on the face of\r\nan American who had invited to dinner a \"Conseiller de Cour,\" on the\r\nassumption that he would have a Court dignitary as his guest, and\r\nwho casually discovered that the personage in question was simply an\r\ninsignificant official in one of the public offices. No doubt other\r\npeople have had similar experiences. The unwary foreigner who has heard\r\nthat there is in Russia a very important institution called the \"Conseil\r\nd\u0027Etat,\" naturally supposes that a \"Conseiller d\u0027Etat\" is a member\r\nof that venerable body; and if he meets \"Son Excellence le Conseiller\r\nprive,\" he is pretty sure to assume--especially if the word \"actuel\"\r\nhas been affixed--that he sees before him a real living member of the\r\nRussian Privy Council. When to the title is added, \"de S. M. l\u0027Empereur\r\nde toutes les Russies,\" a boundless field is opened up to the\r\nnon-Russian imagination. In reality these titles are not nearly so\r\nimportant as they seem. The soi-disant \"Conseiller de Cour\" has probably\r\nnothing to do with the Court. The Conseiller d\u0027Etat is so far from being\r\na member of the Conseil d\u0027Etat that he cannot possibly become a member\r\ntill he receives a higher tchin.* As to the Privy Councillor, it is\r\nsufficient to say that the Privy Council, which had a very odious\r\nreputation in its lifetime, died more than a century ago, and has not\r\nsince been resuscitated. The explanation of these anomalies is to be\r\nfound in the fact that the Russian tchins, like the German honorary\r\ntitles--Hofrath, Staatsrath, Geheimrath--of which they are a literal\r\ntranslation, indicate not actual office, but simply official rank.\r\nFormerly the appointment to an office generally depended on the tchin;\r\nnow there is a tendency to reverse the old order of things and make the\r\ntchin depend upon the office actually held.\r\n\r\n     * In Russian the two words are quite different; the Council\r\n     is called Gosudarstvenny sovet, and the title Statski\r\n     sovetnik.\r\n\r\nThe reader of practical mind who is in the habit of considering\r\nresults rather than forms and formalities desires probably no further\r\ndescription of the Russian bureaucracy, but wishes to know simply how it\r\nworks in practice. What has it done for Russia in the past, and what is\r\nit doing in the present?\r\n\r\nAt the present day, when faith in despotic civilisers and paternal\r\ngovernment has been rudely shaken, and the advantages of a free,\r\nspontaneous national development are fully recognised, centralised\r\nbureaucracies have everywhere fallen into bad odour. In Russia the\r\ndislike to them is particularly strong, because it has there something\r\nmore than a purely theoretical basis. The recollection of the reign\r\nof Nicholas I., with its stern military regime, and minute, pedantic\r\nformalism, makes many Russians condemn in no measured terms the\r\nadministration under which they live, and most Englishmen will feel\r\ninclined to endorse this condemnation. Before passing sentence,\r\nhowever, we ought to know that the system has at least an historical\r\njustification, and we must not allow our love of constitutional liberty\r\nand local self-government to blind us to the distinction between\r\ntheoretical and historical possibility. What seems to political\r\nphilosophers abstractly the best possible government may be utterly\r\ninapplicable in certain concrete cases. We need not attempt to decide\r\nwhether it is better for humanity that Russia should exist as a\r\nnation, but we may boldly assert that without a strongly centralised\r\nadministration Russia would never have become one of the great European\r\nPowers. Until comparatively recent times the part of the world which\r\nis known as the Russian Empire was a conglomeration of independent or\r\nsemi-independent political units, animated with centrifugal as well as\r\ncentripetal forces; and even at the present day it is far from being\r\na compact homogeneous State. It was the autocratic power, with the\r\ncentralised administration as its necessary complement, that first\r\ncreated Russia, then saved her from dismemberment and political\r\nannihilation, and ultimately secured for her a place among European\r\nnations by introducing Western civilisation.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus recognising clearly that autocracy and a strongly\r\ncentralised administration were necessary first for the creation and\r\nafterwards for the preservation of national independence, we must\r\nnot shut our eyes to the evil consequences which resulted from\r\nthis unfortunate necessity. It was in the nature of things that the\r\nGovernment, aiming at the realisation of designs which its subjects\r\nneither sympathised with nor clearly understood, should have become\r\nseparated from the nation; and the reckless haste and violence with\r\nwhich it attempted to carry out its schemes aroused a spirit of positive\r\nopposition among the masses. A considerable section of the people long\r\nlooked on the reforming Tsars as incarnations of the spirit of evil, and\r\nthe Tsars in their turn looked upon the people as raw material for the\r\nrealisation of their political designs. This peculiar relation between\r\nthe nation and the Government has given the key-note to the whole system\r\nof administration. The Government has always treated the people as\r\nminors, incapable of understanding its political aims, and only very\r\npartially competent to look after their own local affairs. The officials\r\nhave naturally acted in the same spirit. Looking for direction and\r\napprobation merely to their superiors, they have systematically treated\r\nthose over whom they were placed as a conquered or inferior race. The\r\nState has thus come to be regarded as an abstract entity, with interests\r\nentirely different from those of the human beings composing it; and in\r\nall matters in which State interests are supposed to be involved, the\r\nrights of individuals are ruthlessly sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIf we remember that the difficulties of centralised administration must\r\nbe in direct proportion to the extent and territorial variety of\r\nthe country to be governed, we may readily understand how slowly and\r\nimperfectly the administrative machine necessarily works in Russia. The\r\nwhole of the vast region stretching from the Polar Ocean to the Caspian,\r\nand from the shores of the Baltic to the confines of the Celestial\r\nEmpire, is administered from St. Petersburg. The genuine bureaucrat has\r\na wholesome dread of formal responsibility, and generally tries to\r\navoid it by taking all matters out of the hands of his subordinates,\r\nand passing them on to the higher authorities. As soon, therefore,\r\nas affairs are caught up by the administrative machine they begin to\r\nascend, and probably arrive some day at the cabinet of the minister.\r\nThus the ministries are flooded with papers--many of the most trivial\r\nimport--from all parts of the Empire; and the higher officials, even\r\nif they had the eyes of an Argus and the hands of a Briareus, could not\r\npossibly fulfil conscientiously the duties imposed on them. In reality\r\nthe Russian administrators of the higher ranks recall neither Argus\r\nnor Briareus. They commonly show neither an extensive nor a profound\r\nknowledge of the country which they are supposed to govern, and seem\r\nalways to have a fair amount of leisure time at their disposal.\r\n\r\nBesides the unavoidable evils of excessive centralisation, Russia has\r\nhad to suffer much from the jobbery, venality, and extortion of the\r\nofficials. When Peter the Great one day proposed to hang every man who\r\nshould steal as much as would buy a rope, his Procurator-General frankly\r\nreplied that if his Majesty put his project into execution there would\r\nbe no officials left. \"We all steal,\" added the worthy official; \"the\r\nonly difference is that some of us steal larger amounts and more openly\r\nthan others.\" Since these words were spoken nearly two centuries\r\nhave passed, and during all that time Russia has been steadily making\r\nprogress, but until the accession of Alexander II. in 1855 little change\r\ntook place in the moral character of the administration. Some people\r\nstill living can remember the time when they could have repeated,\r\nwithout much exaggeration, the confession of Peter\u0027s Procurator-General.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate aright this ugly phenomenon we must distinguish two kinds\r\nof venality. On the one hand there was the habit of exacting what are\r\nvulgarly termed \"tips\" for services performed, and on the other there\r\nwere the various kinds of positive dishonesty. Though it might not\r\nbe always easy to draw a clear line between the two categories, the\r\ndistinction was fully recognised in the moral consciousness of the\r\ntime, and many an official who regularly received \"sinless revenues\"\r\n(bezgreshniye dokhodi), as the tips were sometimes called, would have\r\nbeen very indignant had he been stigmatised as a dishonest man. The\r\npractice was, in fact, universal, and could be, to a certain extent,\r\njustified by the smallness of the official salaries. In some departments\r\nthere was a recognised tariff. The \"brandy farmers,\" for example, who\r\nworked the State Monopoly for the manufacture and sale of alcoholic\r\nliquors, paid regularly a fixed sum to every official, from the Governor\r\nto the policeman, according to his rank. I knew of one case where an\r\nofficial, on receiving a larger sum than was customary, conscientiously\r\nhanded back the change! The other and more heinous offences were by no\r\nmeans so common, but were still fearfully frequent. Many high officials\r\nand important dignitaries were known to receive large revenues, to\r\nwhich the term \"sinless\" could not by any means be applied, and yet they\r\nretained their position, and were received in society with respectful\r\ndeference.\r\n\r\nThe Sovereigns were well aware of the abuses, and strove more or less\r\nto root them out, but the success which attended their efforts does not\r\ngive us a very exalted idea of the practical omnipotence of autocracy.\r\nIn a centralised bureaucratic administration, in which each official is\r\nto a certain extent responsible for the sins of his subordinates, it is\r\nalways extremely difficult to bring an official culprit to justice, for\r\nhe is sure to be protected by his superiors; and when the superiors are\r\nthemselves habitually guilty of malpractices, the culprit is quite safe\r\nfrom exposure and punishment. The Tsar, indeed, might do much towards\r\nexposing and punishing offenders if he could venture to call in public\r\nopinion to his assistance, but in reality he is very apt to become a\r\nparty to the system of hushing up official delinquencies. He is himself\r\nthe first official in the realm, and he knows that the abuse of power by\r\na subordinate has a tendency to produce hostility towards the fountain\r\nof all official power. Frequent punishment of officials might, it is\r\nthought, diminish public respect for the Government, and undermine that\r\nsocial discipline which is necessary for the public tranquillity. It\r\nis therefore considered expedient to give to official delinquencies as\r\nlittle publicity as possible.\r\n\r\nBesides this, strange as it may seem, a Government which rests on the\r\narbitrary will of a single individual is, notwithstanding occasional\r\noutbursts of severity, much less systematically severe than authority\r\nfounded on free public opinion. When delinquencies occur in very high\r\nplaces the Tsar is almost sure to display a leniency approaching to\r\ntenderness. If it be necessary to make a sacrifice to justice, the\r\nsacrificial operation is made as painless as may be, and illustrious\r\nscapegoats are not allowed to die of starvation in the wilderness--the\r\nwilderness being generally Paris or the Riviera. This fact may seem\r\nstrange to those who are in the habit of associating autocracy with\r\nNeapolitan dungeons and the mines of Siberia, but it is not difficult\r\nto explain. No individual, even though he be the Autocrat of all the\r\nRussias, can so case himself in the armour of official dignity as to be\r\ncompletely proof against personal influences. The severity of autocrats\r\nis reserved for political offenders, against whom they naturally harbour\r\na feeling of personal resentment. It is so much easier for us to be\r\nlenient and charitable towards a man who sins against public morality\r\nthan towards one who sins against ourselves!\r\n\r\nIn justice to the bureaucratic reformers in Russia, it must be said that\r\nthey have preferred prevention to cure. Refraining from all Draconian\r\nlegislation, they have put their faith in a system of ingenious checks\r\nand a complicated formal procedure. When we examine the complicated\r\nformalities and labyrinthine procedure by which the administration is\r\ncontrolled, our first impression is that administrative abuses must be\r\nalmost impossible. Every possible act of every official seems to have\r\nbeen foreseen, and every possible outlet from the narrow path of honesty\r\nseems to have been carefully walled up. As the English reader has\r\nprobably no conception of formal procedure in a highly centralised\r\nbureaucracy, let me give, by way of illustration, an instance which\r\naccidentally came to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the residence of a Governor-General one of the stoves is in need\r\nof repairs. An ordinary mortal may assume that a man with the rank\r\nof Governor-General may be trusted to expend a few shillings\r\nconscientiously, and that consequently his Excellency will at once order\r\nthe repairs to be made and the payment to be put down among the petty\r\nexpenses. To the bureaucratic mind the case appears in a very different\r\nlight. All possible contingencies must be carefully provided for. As\r\na Governor-General may possibly be possessed with a mania for making\r\nuseless alterations, the necessity for the repairs ought to be verified;\r\nand as wisdom and honesty are more likely to reside in an assembly than\r\nin an individual, it is well to entrust the verification to a council. A\r\ncouncil of three or four members accordingly certifies that the repairs\r\nare necessary. This is pretty strong authority, but it is not enough.\r\nCouncils are composed of mere human beings, liable to error and subject\r\nto be intimidated by a Governor-General. It is prudent, therefore, to\r\ndemand that the decision of the council be confirmed by the Procureur,\r\nwho is directly subordinated to the Minister of Justice. When this\r\ndouble confirmation has been obtained, an architect examines the stove,\r\nand makes an estimate. But it would be dangerous to give carte blanche\r\nto an architect, and therefore the estimate has to be confirmed, first\r\nby the aforesaid council and afterwards by the Procureur. When all these\r\nformalities--which require sixteen days and ten sheets of paper--have\r\nbeen duly observed, his Excellency is informed that the contemplated\r\nrepairs will cost two roubles and forty kopecks, or about five shillings\r\nof our money. Even here the formalities do not stop, for the Government\r\nmust have the assurance that the architect who made the estimate and\r\nsuperintended the repairs has not been guilty of negligence. A second\r\narchitect is therefore sent to examine the work, and his report, like\r\nthe estimate, requires to be confirmed by the council and the Procureur.\r\nThe whole correspondence lasts thirty days, and requires no less than\r\nthirty sheets of paper! Had the person who desired the repairs been not\r\na Governor-General, but an ordinary mortal, it is impossible to say how\r\nlong the procedure might have lasted.*\r\n\r\n     * In fairness I feel constrained to add that incidents of\r\n     this kind occasionally occur--or at least occurred as late\r\n     as 1886--in our Indian Administration.  I remember an\r\n     instance of a pane of glass being broken in the Viceroy\u0027s\r\n     bedroom in the Viceregal Lodge at Simla, and it would have\r\n     required nearly a week, if the official procedure had been\r\n     scrupulously observed, to have it replaced by the Public\r\n     Works Department.\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be supposed that this circuitous and complicated\r\nmethod, with its registers, ledgers, and minutes of proceedings, must\r\nat least prevent pilfering; but this a priori conclusion has been\r\nemphatically belied by experience. Every new ingenious device had merely\r\nthe effect of producing a still more ingenious means of avoiding it.\r\nThe system did not restrain those who wished to pilfer, and it had a\r\ndeleterious effect on honest officials by making them feel that the\r\nGovernment reposed no confidence in them. Besides this, it produced\r\namong all officials, honest and dishonest alike, the habit of systematic\r\nfalsification. As it was impossible for even the most pedantic of\r\nmen--and pedantry, be it remarked, is a rare quality among Russians--to\r\nfulfil conscientiously all the prescribed formalities, it became\r\ncustomary to observe the forms merely on paper. Officials certified\r\nfacts which they never dreamed of examining, and secretaries gravely\r\nwrote the minutes of meetings that had never been held! Thus, in the\r\ncase above cited, the repairs were in reality begun and ended long\r\nbefore the architect was officially authorised to begin the work. The\r\ncomedy was nevertheless gravely played out to the end, so that any one\r\nafterwards revising the documents would have found that everything had\r\nbeen done in perfect order.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most ingenious means for preventing administrative abuses\r\nwas devised by the Emperor Nicholas I. Fully aware that he was regularly\r\nand systematically deceived by the ordinary officials, he formed a body\r\nof well-paid officers, called the gendarmerie, who were scattered over\r\nthe country, and ordered to report directly to his Majesty whatever\r\nseemed to them worthy of attention. Bureaucratic minds considered this\r\nan admirable expedient; and the Tsar confidently expected that he would,\r\nby means of these official observers who had no interest in concealing\r\nthe truth, be able to know everything, and to correct all official\r\nabuses. In reality the institution produced few good results, and in\r\nsome respects had a very pernicious influence. Though picked men and\r\nprovided with good salaries, these officers were all more or less\r\npermeated with the prevailing spirit. They could not but feel that they\r\nwere regarded as spies and informers--a humiliating conviction, little\r\ncalculated to develop that feeling of self-respect which is the main\r\nfoundation of uprightness--and that all their efforts could do but\r\nlittle good. They were, in fact, in pretty much the same position\r\nas Peter\u0027s Procurator-General, and, with true Russian bonhomie, they\r\ndisliked ruining individuals who were no worse than the majority of\r\ntheir fellows. Besides this, according to the received code of official\r\nmorality insubordination was a more heinous sin than dishonesty, and\r\npolitical offences were regarded as the blackest of all. The gendarmerie\r\nofficers shut their eyes, therefore, to the prevailing abuses, which\r\nwere believed to be incurable, and directed their attention to real or\r\nimaginary political delinquencies. Oppression and extortion remained\r\nunnoticed, whilst an incautious word or a foolish joke at the expense of\r\nthe Government was too often magnified into an act of high treason.\r\n\r\nThis force still exists under a slightly modified form. Towards the\r\nclose of the reign of Alexander II. (1880), when Count Loris Melikof,\r\nwith the sanction and approval of his august master, was preparing to\r\nintroduce a system of liberal political reforms, it was intended\r\nto abolish the gendarmerie as an organ of political espionage, and\r\naccordingly the direction of it was transferred from the so-called\r\nThird Section of his Imperial Majesty\u0027s Chancery to the Ministry of the\r\nInterior; but when the benevolent monarch was a few months afterwards\r\nassassinated by revolutionists, the project was naturally abandoned, and\r\nthe Corps of Gendarmes, while remaining nominally under the Minister of\r\nthe Interior, was practically reinstated in its former position. Now, as\r\nthen, it serves as a kind of supplement to the ordinary police, and\r\nis generally employed for matters in which secrecy is required.\r\nUnfortunately it is not bound by those legal restrictions which protect\r\nthe public against the arbitrary will of the ordinary authorities.\r\nIn addition to its regular duties it has a vaguely defined roving\r\ncommission to watch and arrest all persons who seem to it in any way\r\ndangerous or suspectes, and it may keep such in confinement for an\r\nindefinite time, or remove them to some distant and inhospitable part\r\nof the Empire, without making them undergo a regular trial. It is,\r\nin short, the ordinary instrument for punishing political dreamers,\r\nsuppressing secret societies, counteracting political agitations, and in\r\ngeneral executing the extra-legal orders of the Government.\r\n\r\nMy relations with this anomalous branch of the administration were\r\nsomewhat peculiar. After my experience with the Vice-Governor of\r\nNovgorod I determined to place myself above suspicion, and accordingly\r\napplied to the \"Chef des Gendarmes\" for some kind of official document\r\nwhich would prove to all officials with whom I might come in contact\r\nthat I had no illicit designs. My request was granted, and I was\r\nfurnished with the necessary documents; but I soon found that in\r\nseeking to avoid Scylla I had fallen into Charybdis. In calming official\r\nsuspicions, I inadvertently aroused suspicions of another kind. The\r\ndocuments proving that I enjoyed the protection of the Government made\r\nmany people suspect that I was an emissary of the gendarmerie, and\r\ngreatly impeded me in my efforts to collect information from private\r\nsources. As the private were for me more important than the official\r\nsources of information, I refrained from asking for a renewal of the\r\nprotection, and wandered about the country as an ordinary unprotected\r\ntraveller. For some time I had no cause to regret this decision. I knew\r\nthat I was pretty closely watched, and that my letters were occasionally\r\nopened in the post-office, but I was subjected to no further\r\ninconvenience. At last, when I had nearly forgotten all about Scylla\r\nand Charybdis, I one night unexpectedly ran upon the former, and, to my\r\nastonishment, found myself formally arrested! The incident happened in\r\nthis wise.\r\n\r\nI had been visiting Austria and Servia, and after a short absence\r\nreturned to Russia through Moldavia. On arriving at the Pruth, which\r\nthere forms the frontier, I found an officer of gendarmerie, whose duty\r\nit was to examine the passports of all passers-by. Though my passport\r\nwas completely en regle, having been duly vise by the British and\r\nRussian Consuls at Galatz, this gentleman subjected me to a searching\r\nexamination regarding my past life, actual occupation, and intentions\r\nfor the future. On learning that I had been for more than two years\r\ntravelling in Russia at my own expense, for the simple purpose of\r\ncollecting miscellaneous information, he looked incredulous, and seemed\r\nto have some doubts as to my being a genuine British subject; but when\r\nmy statements were confirmed by my travelling companion, a Russian\r\nfriend who carried awe-inspiring credentials, he countersigned my\r\npassport, and allowed us to depart. The inspection of our luggage by\r\nthe custom-house officers was soon got over; and as we drove off to the\r\nneighbouring village where we were to spend the night we congratulated\r\nourselves on having escaped for some time from all contact with the\r\nofficial world. In this we were \"reckoning without the host.\" As the\r\nclock struck twelve that night I was roused by a loud knocking at my\r\ndoor, and after a good deal of parley, during which some one proposed to\r\neffect an entrance by force, I drew the bolt. The officer who had\r\nsigned my passport entered, and said, in a stiff, official tone, \"I must\r\nrequest you to remain here for twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nNot a little astonished by this announcement, I ventured to inquire the\r\nreason for this strange request.\r\n\r\n\"That is my business,\" was the laconic reply.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it is; still you must, on mature consideration, admit that\r\nI too have some interest in the matter. To my extreme regret I cannot\r\ncomply with your request, and must leave at sunrise.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not leave. Give me your passport.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless detained by force, I shall start at four o\u0027clock; and as I wish\r\nto get some sleep before that time, I must request you instantly to\r\nretire. You had the right to stop me at the frontier, but you have no\r\nright to come and disturb me in this fashion, and I shall certainly\r\nreport you. My passport I shall give to none but a regular officer of\r\npolice.\"\r\n\r\nHere followed a long discussion on the rights, privileges, and general\r\ncharacter of the gendarmerie, during which my opponent gradually laid\r\naside his dictatorial tone, and endeavoured to convince me that the\r\nhonourable body to which he belonged was merely an ordinary branch of\r\nthe administration. Though evidently irritated, he never, I must say,\r\noverstepped the bounds of politeness, and seemed only half convinced\r\nthat he was justified in interfering with my movements. When he found\r\nthat he could not induce me to give up my passport, he withdrew, and I\r\nagain lay down to rest; but in about half an hour I was again disturbed.\r\nThis time an officer of regular police entered, and demanded my\r\n\"papers.\" To my inquiries as to the reason of all this disturbance, he\r\nreplied, in a very polite, apologetic way, that he knew nothing about\r\nthe reason, but he had received orders to arrest me, and must obey.\r\nTo him I delivered my passport, on condition that I should receive\r\na written receipt, and should be allowed to telegraph to the British\r\nambassador in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I telegraphed to the ambassador, and waited\r\nimpatiently all day for a reply. I was allowed to walk about the village\r\nand the immediate vicinity, but of this permission I did not make much\r\nuse. The village population was entirely Jewish, and Jews in that part\r\nof the world have a wonderful capacity for spreading intelligence. By\r\nthe early morning there was probably not a man, woman, or child in\r\nthe place who had not heard of my arrest, and many of them felt a not\r\nunnatural curiosity to see the malefactor who had been caught by the\r\npolice. To be stared at as a malefactor is not very agreeable, so I\r\npreferred to remain in my room, where, in the company of my friend, who\r\nkindly remained with me and made small jokes about the boasted liberty\r\nof British subjects, I spent the time pleasantly enough. The most\r\ndisagreeable part of the affair was the uncertainty as to how many\r\ndays, weeks, or months I might be detained, and on this point the\r\npolice-officer would not even hazard a conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe detention came to an end sooner than I expected. On the following\r\nday--that is to say, about thirty-six hours after the nocturnal\r\nvisit--the police-officer brought me my passport, and at the same time\r\na telegram from the British Embassy informed me that the central\r\nauthorities had ordered my release. On my afterwards pertinaciously\r\nrequesting an explanation of the unceremonious treatment to which I\r\nhad been subjected, the Minister for Foreign Affairs declared that the\r\nauthorities expected a person of my name to cross the frontier about\r\nthat time with a quantity of false bank-notes, and that I had been\r\narrested by mistake. I must confess that this explanation, though\r\nofficial, seemed to me more ingenious than satisfactory, but I was\r\nobliged to accept it for what it was worth. At a later period I had\r\nagain the misfortune to attract the attention of the secret police, but\r\nI reserve the incident till I come to speak of my relations with the\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nFrom all I have seen and heard of the gendarmerie I am disposed to\r\nbelieve that the officers are for the most part polite, well-educated\r\nmen, who seek to fulfil their disagreeable duties in as inoffensive a\r\nway as possible. It must, however, be admitted that they are generally\r\nregarded with suspicion and dislike, even by those people who fear the\r\nattempts at revolutionary propaganda which it is the special duty of the\r\ngendarmerie to discover and suppress. Nor need this surprise us. Though\r\nvery many people believe in the necessity of capital punishment, there\r\nare few who do not feel a decided aversion to the public executioner.\r\n\r\nThe only effectual remedy for administrative abuses lies in placing the\r\nadministration under public control. This has been abundantly proved in\r\nRussia. All the efforts of the Tsars during many generations to check\r\nthe evil by means of ingenious bureaucratic devices proved utterly\r\nfruitless. Even the iron will and gigantic energy of Nicholas I. were\r\ninsufficient for the task. But when, after the Crimean War, there was a\r\ngreat moral awakening, and the Tsar called the people to his assistance,\r\nthe stubborn, deep-rooted evils immediately disappeared. For a time\r\nvenality and extortion were unknown, and since that period they have\r\nnever been able to regain their old force.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment it cannot be said that the administration is\r\nimmaculate, but it is incomparably purer than it was in old times.\r\nThough public opinion is no longer so powerful as it was in the early\r\nsixties, it is still strong enough to repress many malpractices which\r\nin the time of Nicholas I. and his predecessors were too frequent to\r\nattract attention. On this subject I shall have more to say hereafter.\r\n\r\nIf administrative abuses are rife in the Empire of the Tsars, it is not\r\nfrom any want of carefully prepared laws. In no country in the world,\r\nperhaps, is the legislation more voluminous, and in theory, not only\r\nthe officials, but even the Tsar himself, must obey the laws he has\r\nsanctioned, like the meanest of his subjects. This is one of those\r\ncases, not infrequent in Russia, in which theory differs somewhat from\r\npractice. In real life the Emperor may at any moment override the law\r\nby means of what is called a Supreme Command (vysotchaishiye povelenie),\r\nand a minister may \"interpret\" a law in any way he pleases by means of\r\na circular. This is a frequent cause of complaint even among those who\r\nwish to uphold the Autocratic Power. In their opinion law-respecting\r\nautocracy wielded by a strong Tsar is an excellent institution for\r\nRussia; it is arbitrary autocracy wielded by irresponsible ministers\r\nthat they object to.\r\n\r\nAs Englishmen may have some difficulty in imagining how laws can come\r\ninto being without a Parliament or Legislative Chamber of some sort,\r\nI shall explain briefly how they are manufactured by the Russian\r\nbureaucratic machine without the assistance of representative\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nWhen a minister considers that some institution in his branch of the\r\nservice requires to be reformed, he begins by submitting to the Emperor\r\na formal report on the matter. If the Emperor agrees with his minister\r\nas to the necessity for reform, he orders a Commission to be appointed\r\nfor the purpose of considering the subject and preparing a definite\r\nlegislative project. The Commission meets and sets to work in what seems\r\na very thorough way. It first studies the history of the institution in\r\nRussia from the earliest times downwards--or rather, it listens to\r\nan essay on the subject, especially prepared for the occasion by some\r\nofficial who has a taste for historical studies, and can write in a\r\npleasant style. The next step--to use a phrase which often occurs in the\r\nminutes of such commissions--consists in \"shedding the light of science\r\non the question\" (prolit\u0027 na dyelo svet nauki). This important operation\r\nis performed by preparing a memorial containing the history of similar\r\ninstitutions in foreign countries, and an elaborate exposition of\r\nnumerous theories held by French and German philosophical jurists.\r\nIn these memorials it is often considered necessary to include every\r\nEuropean country except Turkey, and sometimes the small German States\r\nand principal Swiss cantons are treated separately.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the character of these wonderful productions, let me give\r\nan example. From a pile of such papers lying before me I take one almost\r\nat random. It is a memorial relating to a proposed reform of benevolent\r\ninstitutions. First I find a philosophical disquisition on benevolence\r\nin general; next, some remarks on the Talmud and the Koran; then a\r\nreference to the treatment of paupers in Athens after the Peloponnesian\r\nWar, and in Rome under the emperors: then some vague observations on the\r\nMiddle Ages, with a quotation that was evidently intended to be Latin;\r\nlastly, comes an account of the poor-laws of modern times, in which I\r\nmeet with \"the Anglo-Saxon domination,\" King Egbert, King Ethelred, \"a\r\nremarkable book of Icelandic laws, called Hragas\"; Sweden and Norway,\r\nFrance, Holland, Belgium, Prussia, and nearly all the minor German\r\nStates. The most wonderful thing is that all this mass of historical\r\ninformation, extending from the Talmud to the most recent legislation\r\nof Hesse-Darmstadt, is compressed into twenty-one octavo pages! The\r\ndoctrinal part of the memorandum is not less rich. Many respected names\r\nfrom the literature of Germany, France, and England are forcibly dragged\r\nin; and the general conclusion drawn from this mass of raw, undigested\r\nmaterials is believed to be \"the latest results of science.\"\r\n\r\nDoes the reader suspect that I have here chosen an extremely exceptional\r\ncase? If so, let us take the next paper in the file. It refers to a\r\nproject of law regarding imprisonment for debt. On the first page I find\r\nreferences to \"the Salic laws of the fifth century,\" and the \"Assises de\r\nJerusalem, A.D 1099.\" That, I think, will suffice. Let us pass, then, to\r\nthe next step.\r\n\r\nWhen the quintessence of human wisdom and experience has thus been\r\nextracted, the commission considers how the valuable product may\r\nbe applied to Russia, so as to harmonise with the existing general\r\nconditions and local peculiarities. For a man of practical mind this\r\nis, of course, the most interesting and most important part of the\r\noperation, but from Russian legislators it receives comparatively little\r\nattention. Very often have I turned to this section of official papers\r\nin order to obtain information regarding the actual state of the\r\ncountry, and in every case I have been grievously disappointed.\r\nVague general phrases, founded on a priori reasoning rather than on\r\nobservation, together with a few statistical tables--which the cautious\r\ninvestigator should avoid as he would an ambuscade--are too often all\r\nthat is to be found. Through the thin veil of pseudo-erudition the real\r\nfacts are clear enough. These philosophical legislators, who have spent\r\ntheir lives in the official atmosphere of St. Petersburg, know as much\r\nabout Russia as the genuine cockney knows about Great Britain, and\r\nin this part of their work they derive no assistance from the learned\r\nGerman treatises which supply an unlimited amount of historical facts\r\nand philosophical speculation.\r\n\r\nFrom the commission the project passes to the Council of State, where\r\nit is certainly examined and criticised, and perhaps modified, but it is\r\nnot likely to be improved from the practical point of view, because\r\nthe members of the Council are merely ci-devant members of similar\r\ncommissions, hardened by a few additional years of official routine. The\r\nCouncil is, in fact, an assembly of tchinovniks who know little of\r\nthe practical, everyday wants of the unofficial classes. No merchant,\r\nmanufacturer, or farmer ever enters its sacred precincts, so that its\r\nbureaucratic serenity is rarely disturbed by practical objections. It\r\nis not surprising, therefore, that it has been known to pass laws which\r\nwere found at once to be absolutely unworkable.\r\n\r\nFrom the Council of State the Bill is taken to the Emperor, and he\r\ngenerally begins by examining the signatures. The \"Ayes\" are in one\r\ncolumn and the \"Noes\" in another. If his Majesty is not specially\r\nacquainted with the matter--and he cannot possibly be acquainted with\r\nall the matters submitted to him--he usually signs with the majority,\r\nor on the side where he sees the names of officials in whose judgment he\r\nhas special confidence; but if he has strong views of his own, he places\r\nhis signature in whichever column he thinks fit, and it outweighs the\r\nsignatures of any number of Councillors. Whatever side he supports, that\r\nside \"has it,\" and in this way a small minority may be transformed into\r\na majority. When the important question, for example, as to how far\r\nclassics should be taught in the ordinary schools was considered by the\r\nCouncil, it is said that only two members signed in favour of classical\r\neducation, which was excessively unpopular at the moment, but the\r\nEmperor Alexander III., disregarding public opinion and the advice of\r\nhis Councillors, threw his signature into the lighter scale, and the\r\nclassicists were victorious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nMOSCOW AND THE SLAVOPHILS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Ancient Cities--Kief Not a Good Point for Studying Old Russian\r\nNational Life--Great Russians and Little Russians--Moscow--Easter Eve\r\nin the Kremlin--Curious Custom--Anecdote of the Emperor\r\nNicholas--Domiciliary Visits of the Iberian Madonna--The Streets of\r\nMoscow--Recent Changes in the Character of the City--Vulgar Conception\r\nof the Slavophils--Opinion Founded on Personal Acquaintance--Slavophil\r\nSentiment a Century Ago--Origin and Development of the Slavophil\r\nDoctrine--Slavophilism Essentially Muscovite--The Panslavist\r\nElement--The Slavophils and the Emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, as in many of the preceding ones, the reader must\r\nhave observed that at one moment there was a sudden break, almost\r\na solution of continuity, in Russian national life. The Tsardom of\r\nMuscovy, with its ancient Oriental costumes and Byzantine traditions,\r\nunexpectedly disappears, and the Russian Empire, clad in modern garb\r\nand animated with the spirit of modern progress, steps forward uninvited\r\ninto European history. Of the older civilisation, if civilisation it can\r\nbe called, very little survived the political transformation, and that\r\nlittle is generally supposed to hover ghostlike around Kief and Moscow.\r\nTo one or other of these towns, therefore, the student who desires\r\nto learn something of genuine old Russian life, untainted by foreign\r\ninfluences, naturally wends his way. For my part I thought first of\r\nsettling for a time in Kief, the oldest and most revered of Russian\r\ncities, where missionaries from Byzantium first planted Christianity on\r\nRussian soil, and where thousands of pilgrims still assemble yearly\r\nfrom far and near to prostrate themselves before the Holy Icons in the\r\nchurches and to venerate the relics of the blessed saints and martyrs in\r\nthe catacombs of the great monastery. I soon discovered, however, that\r\nKief, though it represents in a certain sense the Byzantine traditions\r\nso dear to the Russian people, is not a good point of observation for\r\nstudying the Russian character. It was early exposed to the ravages of\r\nthe nomadic tribes of the Steppe, and when it was liberated from those\r\nincursions it was seized by the Poles and Lithuanians, and remained for\r\ncenturies under their domination. Only in comparatively recent times\r\ndid it begin to recover its Russian character--a university having been\r\ncreated there for that purpose after the Polish insurrection of 1830.\r\nEven now the process of Russification is far from complete, and the\r\nRussian elements in the population are far from being pure in the\r\nnationalist sense. The city and the surrounding country are, in fact,\r\nLittle Russian rather than Great Russian, and between these two sections\r\nof the population there are profound differences--differences of\r\nlanguage, costume, traditions, popular songs, proverbs, folk-lore,\r\ndomestic arrangements, mode of life, and Communal organisation. In these\r\nand other respects the Little Russians, South Russians, Ruthenes,\r\nor Khokhly, as they are variously designated, differ from the Great\r\nRussians of the North, who form the predominant factor in the\r\nEmpire, and who have given to that wonderful structure its essential\r\ncharacteristics. Indeed, if I did not fear to ruffle unnecessarily the\r\npatriotic susceptibilities of my Great Russian friends who have a pet\r\ntheory on this subject, I should say that we have here two distinct\r\nnationalities, further apart from each other than the English and the\r\nScotch. The differences are due, I believe, partly to ethnographical\r\npeculiarities and partly to historic conditions.\r\n\r\nAs it was the energetic Great Russian empire-builders and not the\r\nhalf-dreamy, half-astute, sympathetic descendants of the Free Cossacks\r\nthat I wanted to study, I soon abandoned my idea of settling in the Holy\r\nCity on the Dnieper, and chose Moscow as my point of observation; and\r\nhere, during several years, I spent regularly some of the winter months.\r\n\r\nThe first few weeks of my stay in the ancient capital of the Tsars were\r\nspent in the ordinary manner of intelligent tourists. After mastering\r\nthe contents of a guide-book I carefully inspected all the officially\r\nrecognised objects of interest--the Kremlin, with its picturesque towers\r\nand six centuries of historical associations; the Cathedrals, containing\r\nthe venerated tombs of martyrs, saints, and Tsars; the old churches,\r\nwith their quaint, archaic, richly decorated Icons; the \"Patriarchs\u0027\r\nTreasury,\" rich in jewelled ecclesiastical vestments and vessels of\r\nsilver and gold; the ancient and the modern palace; the Ethnological\r\nMuseum, showing the costumes and physiognomy of all the various races in\r\nthe Empire; the archaeological collections, containing many objects that\r\nrecall the barbaric splendour of old Muscovy; the picture-gallery, with\r\nIvanof\u0027s gigantic picture, in which patriotic Russian critics discover\r\noccult merits which place it above anything that Western Europe has yet\r\nproduced! Of course I climbed up to the top of the tall belfry which\r\nrejoices in the name of \"Ivan the Great,\" and looked down on the \"gilded\r\ndomes\"* of the churches, and bright green roofs of the houses, and far\r\naway, beyond these, the gently undulating country with the \"Sparrow\r\nHills,\" from which Napoleon is said, in cicerone language, to have\r\n\"gazed upon the doomed city.\" Occasionally I walked about the bazaars\r\nin the hope of finding interesting specimens of genuine native\r\nart-industry, and was urgently invited to purchase every conceivable\r\narticle which I did not want. At midday or in the evening I visited the\r\nmost noted traktirs, and made the acquaintance of the caviar, sturgeons,\r\nsterlets, and other native delicacies for which these institutions\r\nare famous--deafened the while by the deep tones of the colossal\r\nbarrel-organ, out of all proportion to the size of the room; and in\r\norder to see how the common people spent their evenings I looked in at\r\nsome of the more modest traktirs, and gazed with wonder, not unmixed\r\nwith fear, at the enormous quantity of weak tea which the inmates\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\n     * Allowance must be made here for poetical licence.  In\r\n     reality, very few of the domes are gilt.  The great majority\r\n     of them are painted green, like the roofs of the houses.\r\n\r\nSince these first weeks of my sojourn in Moscow more than thirty years\r\nhave passed, and many of my early impressions have been blurred by time,\r\nbut one scene remains deeply graven on my memory. It was Easter Eve,\r\nand I had gone with a friend to the Kremlin to witness the customary\r\nreligious ceremonies. Though the rain was falling heavily, an immense\r\nnumber of people had assembled in and around the Cathedral of the\r\nAssumption. The crowd was of the most mixed kind. There stood the\r\npatient bearded muzhik in his well-worn sheepskin; the big, burly,\r\nself-satisfied merchant in his long black glossy kaftan; the noble with\r\nfashionable great-coat and umbrella; thinly clad old women shivering\r\nin the cold, and bright-eyed young damsels with their warm cloaks drawn\r\nclosely round them; old men with long beard, wallet, and pilgrim\u0027s\r\nstaff; and mischievous urchins with faces for the moment preternaturally\r\ndemure. Each right hand, of old and young alike, held a lighted taper,\r\nand these myriads of flickering little flames produced a curious\r\nillumination, giving to the surrounding buildings a weird\r\npicturesqueness which they do not possess in broad daylight. All stood\r\npatiently waiting for the announcement of the glad tidings: \"He is\r\nrisen!\" As midnight approached, the hum of voices gradually ceased,\r\ntill, as the clock struck twelve, the deep-toned bell on \"Ivan the\r\nGreat\" began to toll, and in answer to this signal all the bells in\r\nMoscow suddenly sent forth a merry peal. Each bell--and their name is\r\nlegion--seemed frantically desirous of drowning its neighbour\u0027s voice,\r\nthe solemn boom of the great one overhead mingling curiously with the\r\nsharp, fussy \"ting-a-ting-ting\" of diminutive rivals. If demons dwell\r\nin Moscow and dislike bell-ringing, as is generally supposed, then\r\nthere must have been at that moment a general stampede of the powers of\r\ndarkness such as is described by Milton in his poem on the Nativity, and\r\nas if this deafening din were not enough, big guns were fired in rapid\r\nsuccession from a battery of artillery close at hand! The noise seemed\r\nto stimulate the religious enthusiasm, and the general excitement had\r\na wonderful effect on a Russian friend who accompanied me. When in his\r\nnormal condition that gentleman was a quiet, undemonstrative person,\r\ndevoted to science, an ardent adherent of Western civilisation in\r\ngeneral and of Darwinism in particular, and a thorough sceptic with\r\nregard to all forms of religious belief; but the influence of the\r\nsurroundings was too much for his philosophical equanimity. For a moment\r\nhis orthodox Muscovite soul awoke from its sceptical, cosmopolitan\r\nlethargy. After crossing himself repeatedly--an act of devotion which I\r\nhad never before seen him perform--he grasped my arm, and, pointing to\r\nthe crowd, said in an exultant tone of voice, \"Look there! There is a\r\nsight that you can see nowhere but in the \u0027White-stone City.\u0027* Are not\r\nthe Russians a religious people?\"\r\n\r\n     *Belokamenny, meaning \"of white stone,\" is one of the\r\n     popular names of Moscow.\r\n\r\nTo this unexpected question I gave a monosyllabic assent, and refrained\r\nfrom disturbing my friend\u0027s new-born enthusiasm by any discordant note;\r\nbut I must confess that this sudden outburst of deafening noise and\r\nthe dazzling light aroused in my heretical breast feelings of a warlike\r\nrather than a religious kind. For a moment I could imagine myself in\r\nancient Moscow, and could fancy the people being called out to repel a\r\nTartar horde already thundering at the gates!\r\n\r\nThe service lasted two or three hours, and terminated with the curious\r\nceremony of blessing the Easter cakes, which were ranged--each one with\r\na lighted taper stuck in it--in long rows outside of the cathedral. A\r\nnot less curious custom practised at this season is that of exchanging\r\nkisses of fraternal love. Theoretically one ought to embrace and be\r\nembraced by all present--indicating thereby that all are brethren in\r\nChrist--but the refinements of modern life have made innovations in the\r\npractice, and most people confine their salutations to their friends\r\nand acquaintances. When two friends meet during that night or on the\r\nfollowing day, the one says, \"Christos voskres!\" (\"Christ hath risen!\");\r\nand the other replies, \"Vo istine voskres!\" (\"In truth he hath risen!\").\r\nThey then kiss each other three times on the right and left cheek\r\nalternately. The custom is more or less observed in all classes of\r\nsociety, and the Emperor himself conforms to it.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of an anecdote which is related of the Emperor Nicholas\r\nI., tending to show that he was not so devoid of kindly human feelings\r\nas his imperial and imperious exterior suggested. On coming out of his\r\ncabinet one Easter morning he addressed to the soldier who was mounting\r\nguard at the door the ordinary words of salutation, \"Christ hath risen!\"\r\nand received instead of the ordinary reply, a flat contradiction--\"Not\r\nat all, your Imperial Majesty!\" Astounded by such an unexpected\r\nanswer--for no one ventured to dissent from Nicholas even in the most\r\nguarded and respectful terms--he instantly demanded an explanation. The\r\nsoldier, trembling at his own audacity, explained that he was a Jew,\r\nand could not conscientiously admit the fact of the Resurrection. This\r\nboldness for conscience\u0027 sake so pleased the Tsar that he gave the man a\r\nhandsome Easter present.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century after the Easter Eve above mentioned--or, to be\r\nquite accurate, on the 26th of May, 1896--I again find myself in the\r\nKremlin on the occasion of a great religious ceremony--a ceremony\r\nwhich shows that \"the White-stone City\" on the Moskva is still in some\r\nrespects the capital of Holy Russia. This time my post of observation is\r\ninside the cathedral, which is artistically draped with purple hangings\r\nand crowded with the most distinguished personages of the Empire, all\r\narrayed in gorgeous apparel--Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses, Imperial\r\nHighnesses and High Excellencies, Metropolitans and Archbishops,\r\nSenators and Councillors of State, Generals and Court dignitaries. In\r\nthe centre of the building, on a high, richly decorated platform, sits\r\nthe Emperor with his Imperial Consort, and his mother, the widowed\r\nConsort of Alexander III. Though Nicholas II. has not the colossal\r\nstature which has distinguished so many of the Romanofs, he is well\r\nbuilt, holds himself erect, and shows a quiet dignity in his movements;\r\nwhile his face, which resembles that of his cousin, the Prince of Wales,\r\nwears a kindly, sympathetic expression. The Empress looks even more than\r\nusually beautiful, in a low dress cut in the ancient fashion, her thick\r\nbrown hair, dressed most simply without jewellery or other ornaments,\r\nfalling in two long ringlets over her white shoulders. For the moment,\r\nher attire is much simpler than that of the Empress Dowager, who wears\r\na diamond crown and a great mantle of gold brocade, lined and edged\r\nwith ermine, the long train displaying in bright-coloured embroidery the\r\nheraldic double-headed eagle of the Imperial arms.\r\n\r\nEach of these august personages sits on a throne of curious workmanship,\r\nconsecrated by ancient historic associations. That of the Emperor, the\r\ngift of the Shah of Persia to Ivan the Terrible, and commonly called the\r\nThrone of Tsar Michael, the founder of the Romanof dynasty, is covered\r\nwith gold plaques, and studded with hundreds of big, roughly cut\r\nprecious stones, mostly rubies, emeralds, and turquoises. Of still older\r\ndate is the throne of the young Empress, for it was given by Pope Paul\r\nII. to Tsar Ivan III., grandfather of the Terrible, on the occasion of\r\nhis marriage with a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor. More recent\r\nbut not less curious is that of the Empress Dowager. It is the throne of\r\nTsar Alexis, the father of Peter the Great, covered with countless and\r\npriceless diamonds, rubies, and pearls, and surmounted by an Imperial\r\neagle of solid gold, together with golden statuettes of St. Peter and\r\nSt. Nicholas, the miracle-worker. Over each throne is a canopy of purple\r\nvelvet fringed with gold, out of which rise stately plumes representing\r\nthe national colours.\r\n\r\nTheir Majesties have come hither, in accordance with time-honoured\r\ncustom, to be crowned in this old Cathedral of the Assumption, the\r\ncentral point of the Kremlin, within a stone-throw of the Cathedral of\r\nthe Archangel Michael, in which lie the remains of the old Grand Dukes\r\nand Tsars of Muscovy. Already the Emperor has read aloud, in a clear,\r\nunfaltering voice, from a richly bound parchment folio, held by the\r\nMetropolitan of St. Petersburg, the Orthodox creed; and his Eminence,\r\nafter invoking on his Majesty the blessing of the Holy Spirit, has\r\nperformed the mystic rite of placing his hands in the form of a cross on\r\nthe Imperial forehead. Thus all is ready for the most important part of\r\nthe solemn ceremony. Standing erect, the Emperor doffs his small\r\ndiadem and puts on with his own hands the great diamond crown, offered\r\nrespectfully by the Metropolitan; then he reseats himself on his\r\nthrone, holding in his right hand the Sceptre and in his left the Orb\r\nof Dominion. After sitting thus in state for a few minutes, he stands up\r\nand proceeds to crown his august spouse, kneeling before him. First he\r\ntouches her forehead with his own crown, and then he places on her\r\nhead a smaller one, which is immediately attached to her hair by four\r\nladies-in-waiting, dressed in the old Muscovite Court-costume. At the\r\nsame time her Majesty is invested with a mantle of heavy gold brocade,\r\nsimilar to those of the Emperor and Empress Dowager, lined and bordered\r\nwith ermine.\r\n\r\nThus crowned and robed their Majesties sit in state, while a\r\nproto-deacon reads, in a loud stentorian voice, the long list of\r\nsonorous hereditary titles belonging of right to the Imperator and\r\nAutocrat of all the Russias, and the choir chants a prayer invoking long\r\nlife and happiness--\"Many years! Many years! Many years!\"--on the high\r\nand mighty possessor of the titles aforesaid. And now begins the Mass,\r\ncelebrated with a pomp and magnificence that can be witnessed only\r\nonce or twice in a generation. Sixty gorgeously robed ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries of the highest orders fulfil their various functions with\r\ndue solemnity and unction; but the magnificence of the vestments and the\r\npomp of the ceremonial are soon forgotten in the exquisite solemnising\r\nmusic, as the deep double-bass tones of the adult singers in the\r\nbackground--carefully selected for the occasion in all parts of the\r\nEmpire--peal forth as from a great organ, and blend marvellously with\r\nthe clear, soft, gentle notes of the red-robed chorister boys in front\r\nof the Iconostase. Listening with intense emotion, I involuntarily\r\nrecall to mind Fra Angelico\u0027s pictures of angelic choirs, and cannot\r\nhelp thinking that the pious old Florentine, whose soul was attuned to\r\nall that was sacred and beautiful, must have heard in imagination such\r\nmusic as this. So strong is the impression that the subsequent details\r\nof the long ceremony, including the anointing with the holy chrism, fail\r\nto engrave themselves on my memory. One incident, however, remains; and\r\nif it had happened in an earlier and more superstitious age it would\r\ndoubtless have been chronicled as an omen full of significance. As the\r\nEmperor is on the point of descending from the dais, duly crowned and\r\nanointed, a staggering ray of sunshine steals through one of the narrow\r\nupper windows and, traversing the dimly lit edifice, falls full on the\r\nImperial crown, lighting up for a moment the great mass of diamonds with\r\na hundredfold brilliance.\r\n\r\nIn a detailed account of the Coronation which I wrote on leaving the\r\nKremlin, I find the following: \"The magnificent ceremony is at an end,\r\nand now Nicholas II. is the crowned Emperor and anointed Autocrat of all\r\nthe Russias. May the cares of Empire rest lightly on him! That must be\r\nthe earnest prayer of every loyal subject and every sincere well-wisher,\r\nfor of all living mortals he is perhaps the one who has been\r\nentrusted by Providence with the greatest power and the greatest\r\nresponsibilities.\" In writing those words I did not foresee how heavy\r\nhis responsibilities would one day weigh upon him, when his Empire would\r\nbe sorely tried, by foreign war and internal discontent.\r\n\r\nOne more of these old Moscow reminiscences, and I have done. A day or\r\ntwo after the Coronation I saw the Khodinskoye Polye, a great plain in\r\nthe outskirts of Moscow, strewn with hundreds of corpses! During\r\nthe previous night enormous crowds from the city and the surrounding\r\ndistricts had collected here in order to receive at sunrise, by the\r\nTsar\u0027s command, a little memento of the coronation ceremony, in the\r\nform of a packet containing a metal cup and a few eatables; and as day\r\ndawned, in their anxiety to get near the row of booths from which the\r\ndistribution was to be made, about two thousand had been crushed to\r\ndeath. It was a sight more horrible than a battlefield, because among\r\nthe dead were a large proportion of women and children, terribly\r\nmutilated in the struggle. Altogether, \"a sight to shudder at, not to\r\nsee!\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the remark of my friend in the Kremlin on Easter Eve,\r\nthe Russians in general, and the Muscovites in particular, as the\r\nquintessence of all that is Russian, are certainly a religious people,\r\nbut their piety sometimes finds modes of expression which rather\r\nshock the Protestant mind. As an instance of these, I may mention the\r\ndomiciliary visits of the Iberian Madonna. This celebrated Icon, for\r\nreasons which I have never heard satisfactorily explained, is held\r\nin peculiar veneration by the Muscovites, and occupies in popular\r\nestimation a position analogous to the tutelary deities of ancient pagan\r\ncities. Thus when Napoleon was about to enter the city in 1812, the\r\npopulace clamorously called upon the Metropolitan to take the Madonna,\r\nand lead them out armed with hatchets against the hosts of the infidel;\r\nand when the Tsar visits Moscow he generally drives straight from the\r\nrailway-station to the little chapel where the Icon resides--near one of\r\nthe entrances to the Kremlin--and there offers up a short prayer.\r\nEvery Orthodox Russian, as he passes this chapel, uncovers and crosses\r\nhimself, and whenever a religious service is performed in it there\r\nis always a considerable group of worshippers. Some of the richer\r\ninhabitants, however, are not content with thus performing their\r\ndevotions in public before the Icon. They like to have it from time to\r\ntime in their houses, and the ecclesiastical authorities think fit to\r\nhumour this strange fancy. Accordingly every morning the Iberian Madonna\r\nmay be seen driving about the city from one house to another in a\r\ncarriage and four! The carriage may be at once recognised, not from any\r\npeculiarity in its structure, for it is an ordinary close carriage such\r\nas may be obtained at livery stables, but by the fact that the coachman\r\nsits bare-headed, and all the people in the street uncover and cross\r\nthemselves as it passes. Arrived at the house to which it has been\r\ninvited, the Icon is carried through all the rooms, and in the principal\r\napartment a short religious service is performed before it. As it is\r\nbeing brought in or taken away, female servants may sometimes be seen\r\nto kneel on the floor so that it may be carried over them. During\r\nits absence from its chapel it is replaced by a copy not easily\r\ndistinguishable from the original, and thus the devotions of the\r\nfaithful and the flow of pecuniary contributions do not suffer\r\ninterruption. These contributions, together with the sums paid for the\r\ndomiciliary visits, amount to a considerable yearly sum, and go--if I am\r\nrightly informed--to swell the revenues of the Metropolitan.\r\n\r\nA single drive or stroll through Moscow will suffice to convince the\r\ntraveller, even if he knows nothing of Russian history, that the city\r\nis not, like its modern rival on the Neva, the artificial creation of a\r\nfar-seeing, self-willed autocrat, but rather a natural product which has\r\ngrown up slowly and been modified according to the constantly changing\r\nwants of the population. A few of the streets have been Europeanised--in\r\nall except the paving, which is everywhere execrably Asiatic--to suit\r\nthe tastes of those who have adopted European culture, but the great\r\nmajority of them still retain much of their ancient character and\r\nprimitive irregularity. As soon as we diverge from the principal\r\nthoroughfares, we find one-storied houses--some of them still of\r\nwood--which appear to have been transported bodily from the country,\r\nwith courtyard, garden, stables, and other appurtenances. The whole is\r\nno doubt a little compressed, for land has here a certain value, but the\r\ncharacter is in no way changed, and we have some difficulty in believing\r\nthat we are not in the suburbs but near the centre of a great\r\ntown. There is nothing that can by any possibility be called street\r\narchitecture. Though there is unmistakable evidence of the streets\r\nhaving been laid out according to a preconceived plan, many of them show\r\nclearly that in their infancy they had a wayward will of their own, and\r\nbent to the right or left without any topographical justification. The\r\nhouses, too, display considerable individuality of character, having\r\nevidently during the course of their construction paid no attention to\r\ntheir neighbours. Hence we find no regularly built terraces, crescents,\r\nor squares. There is, it is true, a double circle of boulevards, but the\r\nhouses which flank them have none of that regularity which we commonly\r\nassociate with the term. Dilapidated buildings which in West-European\r\ncities would hide themselves in some narrow lane or back slum here\r\nstand composedly in the face of day by the side of a palatial residence,\r\nwithout having the least consciousness of the incongruity of their\r\nposition, just as the unsophisticated muzhik, in his unsavoury\r\nsheepskin, can stand in the midst of a crowd of well-dressed people\r\nwithout feeling at all awkward or uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAll this incongruity, however, is speedily disappearing. Moscow has\r\nbecome the centre of a great network of railways, and the commercial\r\nand industrial capital of the Empire. Already her rapidly increasing\r\npopulation has nearly reached a million.* The value of land and property\r\nis being doubled and trebled, and building speculations, with the aid of\r\ncredit institutions of various kinds, are being carried on with feverish\r\nrapidity. Well may the men of the old school complain that the world is\r\nturned upside down, and regret the old times of traditional somnolence\r\nand comfortable routine! Those good old times are gone now, never to\r\nreturn. The ancient capital, which long gloried in its past historical\r\nassociations, now glories in its present commercial prosperity, and\r\nlooks forward with confidence to the future. Even the Slavophils, the\r\nobstinate champions of the ultra-Muscovite spirit, have changed with the\r\ntimes, and descended to the level of ordinary prosaic life. These men,\r\nwho formerly spent years in seeking to determine the place of Moscow\r\nin the past and future history of humanity, have--to their honour be\r\nit said--become in these latter days town-counsellors, and have devoted\r\nmuch of their time to devising ways and means of improving the drainage\r\nand the street-paving! But I am anticipating in a most unjustifiable\r\nway. I ought first to tell the reader who these Slavophils were, and why\r\nthey sought to correct the commonly received conceptions of universal\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n     * According to the census of 1897 it was 988,610.\r\n\r\nThe reader may have heard of the Slavophils as a set of fanatics who,\r\nabout half a century ago, were wont to go about in what they considered\r\nthe ancient Russian costume, who wore beards in defiance of Peter the\r\nGreat\u0027s celebrated ukaz and Nicholas\u0027s clearly-expressed wish anent\r\nshaving, who gloried in Muscovite barbarism, and had solemnly \"sworn a\r\nfeud\" against European civilisation and enlightenment. By the tourists\r\nof the time who visited Moscow they were regarded as among the most\r\nnoteworthy lions of the place, and were commonly depicted in not very\r\nflattering colours. At the beginning of the Crimean War they were among\r\nthe extreme Chauvinists who urged the necessity of planting the Greek\r\ncross on the desecrated dome of St. Sophia in Constantinople, and\r\nhoped to see the Emperor proclaimed \"Panslavonic Tsar\"; and after the\r\ntermination of the war they were frequently accused of inventing Turkish\r\natrocities, stirring up discontent among the Slavonic subjects of the\r\nSultan, and secretly plotting for the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire.\r\nAll this was known to me before I went to Russia, and I had consequently\r\ninvested the Slavophils with a halo of romance. Shortly after my arrival\r\nin St. Petersburg I heard something more which tended to increase my\r\ninterest in them--they had caused, I was told, great trepidation among\r\nthe highest official circles by petitioning the Emperor to resuscitate a\r\ncertain ancient institution, called Zemskiye Sobory, which might be\r\nmade to serve the purposes of a parliament! This threw a new light\r\nupon them--under the disguise of archaeological conservatives they were\r\nevidently aiming at important liberal reforms.\r\n\r\nAs a foreigner and a heretic, I expected a very cold and distant\r\nreception from these uncompromising champions of Russian nationality and\r\nthe Orthodox faith; but in this I was agreeably disappointed. By all\r\nof them I was received in the most amiable and friendly way, and I soon\r\ndiscovered that my preconceived ideas of them were very far from the\r\ntruth. Instead of wild fanatics I found quiet, extremely intelligent,\r\nhighly educated gentlemen, speaking foreign languages with ease and\r\nelegance, and deeply imbued with that Western culture which they were\r\ncommonly supposed to despise. And this first impression was amply\r\nconfirmed by subsequent experience during several years of friendly\r\nintercourse. They always showed themselves men of earnest character\r\nand strong convictions, but they never said or did anything that could\r\njustify the appellation of fanatics. Like all philosophical theorists,\r\nthey often allowed their logic to blind them to facts, but their\r\nreasonings were very plausible--so plausible, indeed, that, had I been a\r\nRussian they would have almost persuaded me to be a Slavophil, at least\r\nduring the time they were talking to me.\r\n\r\nTo understand their doctrine we must know something of its origin and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Slavophil sentiment, which must not be confounded\r\nwith the Slavophil doctrine, is to be sought in the latter half of\r\nthe seventeenth century, when the Tsars of Muscovy were introducing\r\ninnovations in Church and State. These innovations were profoundly\r\ndispleasing to the people. A large portion of the lower classes, as I\r\nhave related in a previous chapter, sought refuge in Old Ritualism or\r\nsectarianism, and imagined that Tsar Peter, who called himself by the\r\nheretical title of \"Imperator,\" was an emanation of the Evil Principle.\r\nThe nobles did not go quite so far. They remained members of the\r\nofficial Church, and restricted themselves to hinting that Peter was the\r\nson, not of Satan, but of a German surgeon--a lineage which, according\r\nto the conceptions of the time, was a little less objectionable; but\r\nmost of them were very hostile to the changes, and complained bitterly\r\nof the new burdens which these changes entailed. Under Peter\u0027s immediate\r\nsuccessors, when not only the principles of administration but also many\r\nof the administrators were German, this hostility greatly increased.\r\n\r\nSo long as the innovations appeared only in the official activity of\r\nthe Government, the patriotic, conservative spirit was obliged to keep\r\nsilence; but when the foreign influence spread to the social life of the\r\nCourt aristocracy, the opposition began to find a literary expression.\r\nIn the time of Catherine II., when Gallomania was at its height in Court\r\ncircles, comedies and satirical journals ridiculed those who, \"blinded\r\nby some externally brilliant gifts of foreigners, not only prefer\r\nforeign countries to their native land, but even despise their\r\nfellow-countrymen, and think that a Russian ought to borrow all--even\r\npersonal character. As if nature arranging all things with such wisdom,\r\nand bestowing on all regions the gifts and customs which are appropriate\r\nto the climate, had been so unjust as to refuse to the Russians a\r\ncharacter of their own! As if she condemned them to wander over all\r\nregions, and to adopt by bits the various customs of various nations,\r\nin order to compose out of the mixture a new character appropriate to\r\nno nation whatever!\" Numerous passages of this kind might be quoted,\r\nattacking the \"monkeyism\" and \"parrotism\" of those who indiscriminately\r\nadopted foreign manners and customs--those who\r\n\r\n     \"Sauntered Europe round,\r\n      And gathered ev\u0027ry vice in ev\u0027ry ground.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes the terms and metaphors employed were more forcible than\r\nrefined. One satirical journal, for instance, relates an amusing\r\nstory about certain little Russian pigs that went to foreign lands to\r\nenlighten their understanding, and came back to their country full-grown\r\nswine. The national pride was wounded by the thought that Russians\r\ncould be called \"clever apes who feed on foreign intelligence,\" and\r\nmany writers, stung by such reproaches, fell into the opposite extreme,\r\ndiscovering unheard-of excellences in the Russian mind and character,\r\nand vociferously decrying everything foreign in order to place these\r\nimagined excellences in a stronger light by contrast. Even when they\r\nrecognised that their country was not quite so advanced in civilisation\r\nas certain other nations, they congratulated themselves on the fact,\r\nand invented by way of justification an ingenious theory, which was\r\nafterwards developed by the Slavophils. \"The nations of the West,\" they\r\nsaid, \"began to live before us, and are consequently more advanced than\r\nwe are; but we have on that account no reason to envy them, for we can\r\nprofit by their errors, and avoid those deep-rooted evils from which\r\nthey are suffering. He who has just been born is happier than he who is\r\ndying.\"\r\n\r\nThus, we see, a patriotic reaction against the introduction of foreign\r\ninstitutions and the inordinate admiration of foreign culture already\r\nexisted in Russia more than a century ago. It did not, however, take the\r\nform of a philosophical theory till a much later period, when a similar\r\nmovement was going on in various countries of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter the overthrow of the great Napoleonic Empire a reaction against\r\ncosmopolitanism took place and a romantic enthusiasm for nationality\r\nspread over Europe like an epidemic. Blind, enthusiastic patriotism\r\nbecame the fashionable sentiment of the time. Each nation took to\r\nadmiring itself complacently, to praising its own character and\r\nachievements, and to idealising its historical and mythical past.\r\nNational peculiarities, \"local colour,\" ancient customs, traditional\r\nsuperstitions--in short, everything that a nation believed to be\r\nspecially and exclusively its own, now raised an enthusiasm similar to\r\nthat which had been formerly excited by cosmopolitan conceptions founded\r\non the law of nature. The movement produced good and evil results.\r\nIn serious minds it led to a deep and conscientious study of history,\r\nnational literature, popular mythology, and the like; whilst in\r\nfrivolous, inflammable spirits it gave birth merely to a torrent of\r\npatriotic fervour and rhetorical exaggeration. The Slavophils were the\r\nRussian representatives of this nationalistic reaction, and displayed\r\nboth its serious and its frivolous elements.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important products of this movement in Germany was the\r\nHegelian theory of universal history. According to Hegel\u0027s views,\r\nwhich were generally accepted by those who occupied themselves with\r\nphilosophical questions, universal history was described as \"Progress in\r\nthe consciousness of freedom\" (Fortschritt im Bewusstsein der Freiheit).\r\nIn each period of the world\u0027s history, it was explained, some one\r\nnation or race had been intrusted with the high mission of enabling the\r\nAbsolute Reason, or Weltgeist, to express itself in objective existence,\r\nwhile the other nations and races had for the time no metaphysical\r\njustification for their existence, and no higher duty than to imitate\r\nslavishly the favoured rival in which the Weltgeist had for the moment\r\nchosen to incorporate itself. The incarnation had taken place first in\r\nthe Eastern Monarchies, then in Greece, next in Rome, and lastly in the\r\nGermanic race; and it was generally assumed, if not openly asserted,\r\nthat this mystical Metempsychosis of the Absolute was now at an end. The\r\ncycle of existence was complete. In the Germanic peoples the Weltgeist\r\nhad found its highest and final expression.\r\n\r\nRussians in general knew nothing about German philosophy, and were\r\nconsequently not in any way affected by these ideas, but there was in\r\nMoscow a small group of young men who ardently studied German literature\r\nand metaphysics, and they were much shocked by Hegel\u0027s views. Ever since\r\nthe brilliant reign of Catherine II., who had defeated the Turks and had\r\ndreamed of resuscitating the Byzantine Empire, and especially since the\r\nmemorable events of 1812-15, when Alexander I. appeared as the liberator\r\nof enthralled Europe and the arbiter of her destinies, Russians\r\nwere firmly convinced that their country was destined to play a most\r\nimportant part in human history. Already the great Russian historian\r\nKaramzin had declared that henceforth Clio must be silent or accord\r\nto Russia a prominent place in the history of the nations. Now, by the\r\nHegelian theory, the whole of the Slav race was left out in the cold,\r\nwith no high mission, with no new truths to divulge, with nothing better\r\nto do, in fact, than to imitate the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic philosophers of Moscow could not, of course, adopt this\r\nview. Whilst accepting the fundamental principles, they declared the\r\ntheory to be incomplete. The incompleteness lay in the assumption that\r\nhumanity had already entered on the final stages of its development. The\r\nTeutonic nations were perhaps for the moment the leaders in the march of\r\ncivilisation, but there was no reason to suppose that they would always\r\nretain that privileged position. On the contrary, there were already\r\nsymptoms that their ascendency was drawing to a close. \"Western Europe,\"\r\nit was said, \"presents a strange, saddening spectacle. Opinion struggles\r\nagainst opinion, power against power, throne against throne. Science,\r\nArt, and Religion, the three chief motors of social life, have lost\r\ntheir force. We venture to make an assertion which to many at present\r\nmay seem strange, but which will be in a few years only too evident:\r\nWestern Europe is on the highroad to ruin! We Russians, on the contrary,\r\nare young and fresh, and have taken no part in the crimes of Europe.\r\nWe have a great mission to fulfil. Our name is already inscribed on\r\nthe tablets of victory, and now we have to inscribe our spirit in the\r\nhistory of the human mind. A higher kind of victory--the victory of\r\nScience, Art and Faith--awaits us on the ruins of tottering Europe!\"*\r\n\r\n     * These words were written by Prince Odoefski.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was supported by arguments drawn from history--or,\r\nat least, what was believed to be history. The European world was\r\nrepresented as being composed of two hemispheres--the Eastern or\r\nGraeco-Slavonic on the one hand, and the Western, or Roman Catholic\r\nand Protestant, on the other. These two hemispheres, it was said, are\r\ndistinguished from each other by many fundamental characteristics. In\r\nboth of them Christianity formed originally the basis of civilisation,\r\nbut in the West it became distorted and gave a false direction to the\r\nintellectual development. By placing the logical reason of the learned\r\nabove the conscience of the whole Church, Roman Catholicism produced\r\nProtestantism, which proclaimed the right of private judgment and\r\nconsequently became split up into innumerable sects. The dry, logical\r\nspirit which was thus fostered created a purely intellectual, one-sided\r\nphilosophy, which must end in pure scepticism, by blinding men to those\r\ngreat truths which lie above the sphere of reasoning and logic. The\r\nGraeco-Slavonic world, on the contrary, having accepted Christianity\r\nnot from Rome, but from Byzantium, received pure orthodoxy and true\r\nenlightenment, and was thus saved alike from Papal tyranny and from\r\nProtestant free-thinking. Hence the Eastern Christians have preserved\r\nfaithfully not only the ancient dogmas, but also the ancient spirit of\r\nChristianity--that spirit of pious humility, resignation, and brotherly\r\nlove which Christ taught by precept and example. If they have not yet a\r\nphilosophy, they will create one, and it will far surpass all previous\r\nsystems; for in the writings of the Greek Fathers are to be found the\r\ngerms of a broader, a deeper, and a truer philosophy than the dry,\r\nmeagre rationalism of the West--a philosophy founded not on the logical\r\nfaculty alone, but on the broader basis of human nature as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental characteristics of the Graeco-Slavonic world--so runs\r\nthe Slavophil theory--have been displayed in the history of Russia.\r\nThroughout Western Christendom the principal of individual judgment and\r\nreckless individual egotism have exhausted the social forces and brought\r\nsociety to the verge of incurable anarchy and inevitable dissolution,\r\nwhereas the social and political history of Russia has been harmonious\r\nand peaceful. It presents no struggles between the different social\r\nclasses, and no conflicts between Church and State. All the factors have\r\nworked in unison, and the development has been guided by the spirit of\r\npure orthodoxy. But in this harmonious picture there is one big,\r\nugly black spot--Peter, falsely styled \"the Great,\" and his so-called\r\nreforms. Instead of following the wise policy of his ancestors, Peter\r\nrejected the national traditions and principles, and applied to his\r\ncountry, which belonged to the Eastern world, the principles of Western\r\ncivilisation. His reforms, conceived in a foreign spirit, and elaborated\r\nby men who did not possess the national instincts, were forced upon the\r\nnation against its will, and the result was precisely what might have\r\nbeen expected. The \"broad Slavonic nature\" could not be controlled by\r\ninstitutions which had been invented by narrow-minded, pedantic German\r\nbureaucrats, and, like another Samson, it pulled down the building in\r\nwhich foreign legislators sought to confine it. The attempt to introduce\r\nforeign culture had a still worse effect. The upper classes, charmed and\r\ndazzled by the glare and glitter of Western science, threw themselves\r\nimpulsively on the newly found treasures, and thereby condemned\r\nthemselves to moral slavery and intellectual sterility. Fortunately--and\r\nherein lay one of the fundamental principles of the Slavophil\r\ndoctrine--the imported civilisation had not at all infected the common\r\npeople. Through all the changes which the administration and the\r\nNoblesse underwent the peasantry preserved religiously in their hearts\r\n\"the living legacy of antiquity,\" the essence of Russian nationality,\r\n\"a clear spring welling up living waters, hidden and unknown, but\r\npowerful.\"* To recover this lost legacy by studying the character,\r\ncustoms, and institutions of the peasantry, to lead the educated classes\r\nback to the path from which they had strayed, and to re-establish that\r\nintellectual and moral unity which had been disturbed by the foreign\r\nimportations--such was the task which the Slavophils proposed to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n     * This was one of the favourite themes of Khomiakof, the\r\n     Slavophil poet and theologian.\r\n\r\nDeeply imbued with that romantic spirit which distorted all the\r\nintellectual activity of the time, the Slavophils often indulged in\r\nthe wildest exaggerations, condemning everything foreign and praising\r\neverything Russian. When in this mood they saw in the history of the\r\nWest nothing but violence, slavery, and egotism, and in that of their\r\nown country free-will, liberty, and peace. The fact that Russia did not\r\npossess free political institutions was adduced as a precious fruit of\r\nthat spirit of Christian resignation and self-sacrifice which places\r\nthe Russian at such an immeasurable height above the proud, selfish\r\nEuropean; and because Russia possessed few of the comforts and\r\nconveniences of common life, the West was accused of having made comfort\r\nits God! We need not, however, dwell on these puerilities, which only\r\ngained for their authors the reputation of being ignorant, narrow-minded\r\nmen, imbued with a hatred of enlightenment and desirous of leading their\r\ncountry back to its primitive barbarism. What the Slavophils really\r\ncondemned, at least in their calmer moments, was not European culture,\r\nbut the uncritical, indiscriminate adoption of it by their countrymen.\r\nTheir tirades against foreign culture must appear excusable when we\r\nremember that many Russians of the upper ranks could speak and write\r\nFrench more correctly than their native language, and that even the\r\ngreat national poet Pushkin was not ashamed to confess--what was not\r\ntrue, and a mere piece of affectation--that \"the language of Europe\" was\r\nmore familiar to him than his mother-tongue!\r\n\r\nThe Slavophil doctrine, though it made a great noise in the world, never\r\nfound many adherents. The society of St. Petersburg regarded it as one\r\nof those harmless provincial eccentricities which are always to be found\r\nin Moscow. In the modern capital, with its foreign name, its streets\r\nand squares on the European model, its palaces and churches in the\r\nRenaissance style, and its passionate love of everything French, any\r\nattempt to resuscitate the old Boyaric times would have been eminently\r\nridiculous. Indeed, hostility to St. Petersburg and to \"the Petersburg\r\nperiod of Russian history\" is one of the characteristic traits of\r\ngenuine Slavophilism. In Moscow the doctrine found a more appropriate\r\nhome. There the ancient churches, with the tombs of Grand Princes and\r\nholy martyrs, the palace in which the Tsars of Muscovy had lived, the\r\nKremlin which had resisted--not always successfully--the attacks of\r\nsavage Tartars and heretical Poles, the venerable Icons that had many a\r\ntime protected the people from danger, the block of masonry from which,\r\non solemn occasions, the Tsar and the Patriarch had addressed the\r\nassembled multitude--these, and a hundred other monuments sanctified by\r\ntradition, have kept alive in the popular memory some vague remembrance\r\nof the olden time, and are still capable of awakening antiquarian\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, too, have preserved something of the old Muscovite\r\ncharacter. Whilst successive sovereigns have been striving to make the\r\ncountry a progressive European empire, Moscow has remained the home of\r\npassive conservatism and an asylum for the discontented, especially for\r\nthe disappointed aspirants to Imperial favour. Abandoned by the modern\r\nEmperors, she can glory in her ancient Tsars. But even the Muscovites\r\nwere not prepared to accept the Slavophil doctrine in the extreme form\r\nwhich it assumed, and were not a little perplexed by the eccentricities\r\nof those who professed it. Plain, sensible people, though they might\r\nbe proud of being citizens of the ancient capital, and might thoroughly\r\nenjoy a joke at the expense of St. Petersburg, could not understand\r\na little coterie of enthusiasts who sought neither official rank nor\r\ndecorations, who slighted many of the conventionalities of the higher\r\nclasses to which by birth and education they belonged, who loved to\r\nfraternise with the common people, and who occasionally dressed in the\r\nnational costume which had been discarded by the nobles since the time\r\nof Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nThe Slavophils thus remained merely a small literary party, which\r\nprobably did not count more than a dozen members, but their influence\r\nwas out of all proportion to their numbers. They preached successfully\r\nthe doctrine that the historical development of Russia has been\r\npeculiar, that her present social and political organisation is\r\nradically different from that of the countries of Western Europe, and\r\nthat consequently the social and political evils from which she suffers\r\nare not to be cured by the remedies which have proved efficacious in\r\nFrance and Germany. These truths, which now appear commonplace, were\r\nformerly by no means generally recognised, and the Slavophils deserve\r\ncredit for directing attention to them. Besides this, they helped to\r\nawaken in the upper classes a lively sympathy with the poor, oppressed,\r\nand despised peasantry. So long as the Emperor Nicholas lived they had\r\nto confine themselves to a purely literary activity; but during the\r\ngreat reforms initiated by his successor, Alexander II., they descended\r\ninto the arena of practical politics, and played a most useful and\r\nhonourable part in the emancipation of the serfs. In the new\r\nlocal self-government, too--the Zemstvo and the new municipal\r\ninstitutions--they laboured energetically and to good purpose. Of all\r\nthis I shall have occasion to speak more fully in future chapters.\r\n\r\nBut what of their Panslavist aspirations? By their theory they were\r\nconstrained to pay attention to the Slav race as a whole, but they were\r\nmore Russian than Slav, and more Muscovite than Russian. The Panslavist\r\nelement consequently occupied a secondary place in Slavophil doctrine.\r\nThough they did much to stimulate popular sympathy with the Southern\r\nSlavs, and always cherished the hope that the Serbs, Bulgarians, and\r\ncognate Slav nationalities would one day throw off the bondage of the\r\nGerman and the Turk, they never proposed any elaborate project for the\r\nsolution of the Eastern Question. So far as I was able to gather from\r\ntheir conversation, they seemed to favour the idea of a grand Slavonic\r\nConfederation, in which the hegemony would, of course, belong to Russia.\r\nIn ordinary times the only steps which they took for the realisation of\r\nthis idea consisted in contributing money for schools and churches\r\namong the Slav population of Austria and Turkey, and in educating young\r\nBulgarians in Russia. During the Cretan insurrection they\r\nsympathised warmly with the insurgents as co-religionists, but\r\nafterwards--especially during the crisis of the Eastern Question which\r\nculminated in the Treaty of San Stefano and the Congress of Berlin\r\n(1878)--their Hellenic sympathies cooled, because the Greeks showed that\r\nthey had political aspirations inconsistent with the designs of Russia,\r\nand that they were likely to be the rivals rather than the allies of the\r\nSlavs in the struggle for the Sick Man\u0027s inheritance.\r\n\r\nSince the time when I was living in Moscow in constant intercourse with\r\nthe leading Slavophils more than a quarter of a century has passed, and\r\nof those with whom I spent so many pleasant evenings discussing the past\r\nhistory and future destinies of the Slav races, not one remains alive.\r\nAll the great prophets of the old Slavophil doctrine--Jun Samarin,\r\nPrince Tcherkaski, Ivan Aksakof, Kosheleff--have departed without\r\nleaving behind them any genuine disciples. The present generation of\r\nMuscovite frondeurs, who continue to rail against Western Europe and the\r\npedantic officialism of St. Petersburg, are of a more modern and less\r\nacademic type. Their philippics are directed not against Peter the Great\r\nand his reforms, but rather against recent Ministers of Foreign Affairs\r\nwho are thought to have shown themselves too subservient to foreign\r\nPowers, and against M. Witte, the late Minister of Finance, who is\r\naccused of favouring the introduction of foreign capital and enterprise,\r\nand of sacrificing to unhealthy industrial development the interests of\r\nthe agricultural classes. These laments and diatribes are allowed free\r\nexpression in private conversation and in the Press, but they do not\r\ninfluence very deeply the policy of the Government or the natural course\r\nof events; for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to cultivate\r\nfriendly relations with the Cabinets of the West, and Moscow is rapidly\r\nbecoming, by the force of economic conditions, the great industrial and\r\ncommercial centre of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe administrative and bureaucratic centre--if anything on the frontier\r\nof a country can be called its centre--has long been, and is likely to\r\nremain, Peter\u0027s stately city at the mouth of the Neva, to which I now\r\ninvite the reader to accompany me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG AND EUROPEAN INFLUENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg and Berlin--Big Houses--The \"Lions\"--Peter the Great--His\r\nAims and Policy--The German Regime--Nationalist Reaction--French\r\nInfluence--Consequent Intellectual Sterility--Influence of the\r\nSentimental School--Hostility to Foreign Influences--A New Period of\r\nLiterary Importation--Secret Societies--The Catastrophe--The Age of\r\nNicholas--A Terrible War on Parnassus--Decline of Romanticism and\r\nTranscendentalism--Gogol--The Revolutionary Agitation of 1848--New\r\nReaction--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side the traveller approaches St. Petersburg, unless he\r\ngoes thither by sea, he must traverse several hundred miles of forest\r\nand morass, presenting few traces of human habitation or agriculture.\r\nThis fact adds powerfully to the first impression which the city makes\r\non his mind. In the midst of a waste howling wilderness, he suddenly\r\ncomes on a magnificent artificial oasis.\r\n\r\nOf all the great European cities, the one that most resembles the\r\ncapital of the Tsars is Berlin. Both are built on perfectly level\r\nground; both have wide, regularly arranged streets; in both there is\r\na general look of stiffness and symmetry which suggests military\r\ndiscipline and German bureaucracy. But there is at least one profound\r\ndifference. Though Berlin is said by geographers to be built on the\r\nSpree, we might live a long time in the city without noticing\r\nthe sluggish little stream on which the name of a river has been\r\nundeservedly conferred. St. Petersburg, on the contrary, is built on\r\na magnificent river, which forms the main feature of the place. By its\r\nbreadth, and by the enormous volume of its clear, blue, cold water,\r\nthe Neva is certainly one of the noblest rivers of Europe. A few miles\r\nbefore reaching the Gulf of Finland it breaks up into several streams\r\nand forms a delta. It is here that St. Petersburg stands.\r\n\r\nLike the river, everything in St. Petersburg is on a colossal scale. The\r\nstreets, the squares, the palaces, the public buildings, the churches,\r\nwhatever may be their defects, have at least the attribute of greatness,\r\nand seem to have been designed for the countless generations to come,\r\nrather than for the practical wants of the present inhabitants. In this\r\nrespect the city well represents the Empire of which it is the capital.\r\nEven the private houses are built in enormous blocks and divided into\r\nmany separate apartments. Those built for the working classes sometimes\r\ncontain, I am assured, more than a thousand inhabitants. How many cubic\r\nfeet of air is allowed to each person, I do not know; not so many, I\r\nfear, as is recommended by the most advanced sanitary authorities.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed description of the city I must refer the reader to the\r\nguide books. Among its numerous monuments, of which the Russians are\r\njustly proud, I confess that the one which interested me most was\r\nneither St. Isaac\u0027s Cathedral, with its majestic gilded dome, its\r\ncolossal monolithic columns of red granite, and its gaudy interior; nor\r\nthe Hermitage, with its magnificent collection of Dutch pictures; nor\r\nthe gloomy, frowning fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul, containing\r\nthe tombs of the Emperors. These and other \"sights\" may deserve all the\r\npraise which enthusiastic tourists have lavished upon them, but what\r\nmade a far deeper impression on me was the little wooden house in which\r\nPeter the Great lived whilst his future capital was being built. In its\r\nstyle and arrangement it looks more like the hut of a navvy than the\r\nresidence of a Tsar, but it was quite in keeping with the character of\r\nthe illustrious man who occupied it. Peter could and did occasionally\r\nwork like a navvy without feeling that his Imperial dignity was thereby\r\nimpaired. When he determined to build a new capital on a Finnish\r\nmarsh, inhabited chiefly by wildfowl, he did not content himself with\r\nexercising his autocratic power in a comfortable arm chair. Like the\r\nGreek gods, he went down from his Olympus and took his place in the\r\nranks of ordinary mortals, superintending the work with his own eyes,\r\nand taking part in it with his own hands. If he was as arbitrary and\r\noppressive as any of the pyramid-building Pharaohs, he could at least\r\nsay in self-justification that he did not spare himself any more than\r\nhis people, but exposed himself freely to the discomforts and dangers\r\nunder which thousands of his fellow-labourers succumbed.\r\n\r\nIn reading the account of Peter\u0027s life, written in part by his own pen,\r\nwe can easily understand how the piously Conservative section of his\r\nsubjects failed to recognise in him the legitimate successor of the\r\northodox Tsars. The old Tsars had been men of grave, pompous demeanour,\r\ndeeply imbued with the consciousness of their semi-religious dignity.\r\nLiving habitually in Moscow or its immediate neighbourhood, they spent\r\ntheir time in attending long religious services, in consulting with\r\ntheir Boyars, in being present at ceremonious hunting-parties, in\r\nvisiting the monasteries, and in holding edifying conversations with\r\necclesiastical dignitaries or revered ascetics. If they undertook a\r\njourney, it was probably to make a pilgrimage to some holy shrine; and,\r\nwhether in Moscow or elsewhere, they were always protected from contact\r\nwith ordinary humanity by a formidable barricade of court ceremonial.\r\nIn short, they combined the characters of a Christian monk and of an\r\nOriental potentate.\r\n\r\nPeter was a man of an entirely different type, and played in the calm,\r\ndignified, orthodox, ceremonious world of Moscow the part of the bull in\r\nthe china shop, outraging ruthlessly and wantonly all the time-honored\r\ntraditional conceptions of propriety and etiquette. Utterly regardless\r\nof public opinion and popular prejudices, he swept away the old\r\nformalities, avoided ceremonies of all kinds, scoffed at ancient usage,\r\npreferred foreign secular books to edifying conversations, chose profane\r\nheretics as his boon companions, travelled in foreign countries, dressed\r\nin heretical costume, defaced the image of God and put his soul in\r\njeopardy by shaving off his beard, compelled his nobles to dress and\r\nshave like himself, rushed about the Empire as if goaded on by the demon\r\nof unrest, employed his sacred hands in carpentering and other menial\r\noccupations, took part openly in the uproarious orgies of his foreign\r\nsoldiery, and, in short, did everything that \"the Lord\u0027s anointed\"\r\nmight reasonably be expected not to do. No wonder the Muscovites were\r\nscandalised by his conduct, and that some of them suspected he was not\r\nthe Tsar at all, but Antichrist in disguise. And no wonder he felt the\r\natmosphere of Moscow oppressive, and preferred living in the new capital\r\nwhich he had himself created.\r\n\r\nHis avowed object in building St. Petersburg was to have \"a window by\r\nwhich the Russians might look into civilised Europe\"; and well has\r\nthe city fulfilled its purpose. From its foundation may be dated the\r\nEuropean period of Russian history. Before Peter\u0027s time Russia belonged\r\nto Asia rather than to Europe, and was doubtless regarded by Englishmen\r\nand Frenchmen pretty much as we nowadays regard Bokhara or Kashgar;\r\nsince that time she has formed an integral part of the European\r\npolitical system, and her intellectual history has been but a reflection\r\nof the intellectual history of Western Europe, modified and coloured by\r\nnational character and by peculiar local conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the intellectual history of a nation we generally mean\r\nin reality the intellectual history of the upper classes. With regard\r\nto Russia, more perhaps than with regard to any other country, this\r\ndistinction must always carefully be borne in mind. Peter succeeded in\r\nforcing European civilisation on the nobles, but the people remained\r\nunaffected. The nation was, as it were, cleft in two, and with each\r\nsucceeding generation the cleft has widened. Whilst the masses clung\r\nobstinately to their time-honoured customs and beliefs, the nobles\r\ncame to look on the objects of popular veneration as the relics of a\r\nbarbarous past, of which a civilised nation ought to be ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual movement inaugurated by Peter had a purely practical\r\ncharacter. He was himself a thorough utilitarian, and perceived clearly\r\nthat what his people needed was not theological or philosophical\r\nenlightment, but plain, practical knowledge suitable for the\r\nrequirements of everyday life. He wanted neither theologians nor\r\nphilosophers, but military and naval officers, administrators, artisans,\r\nminers, manufacturers, and merchants, and for this purpose he introduced\r\nsecular technical education. For the young generation primary schools\r\nwere founded, and for more advanced pupils the best foreign works on\r\nfortification, architecture, navigation, metallurgy, engineering and\r\ncognate subjects were translated into the native tongue. Scientific men\r\nand cunning artificers were brought into the country, and young Russians\r\nwere sent abroad to learn foreign languages and the useful arts. In a\r\nword, everything was done that seemed likely to raise the Russians to\r\nthe level of material well-being already attained by the more advanced\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nWe have here an important peculiarity in the intellectual development\r\nof Russia. In Western Europe the modern scientific spirit, being the\r\nnatural offspring of numerous concomitant historical causes, was born in\r\nthe natural way, and Society had, consequently, before giving birth to\r\nit, to endure the pains of pregnancy and the throes of prolonged labour.\r\nIn Russia, on the contrary, this spirit appeared suddenly as an adult\r\nforeigner, adopted by a despotic paterfamilias. Thus Russia made the\r\ntransition from mediaeval to modern times without any violent struggle\r\nbetween the old and the new conceptions such as had taken place in the\r\nWest. The Church, effectually restrained from all active opposition by\r\nthe Imperial power, preserved unmodified her ancient beliefs; whilst the\r\nnobles, casting their traditional conceptions and beliefs to the\r\nwinds, marched forward unfettered on that path which their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers had regarded as the direct road to perdition.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of Peter\u0027s reign Russia was not subjected to\r\nthe exclusive influence of any one particular country. Thoroughly\r\ncosmopolitan in his sympathies, the great reformer, like the Japanese\r\nof the present day, was ready to borrow from any foreign nation--German,\r\nDutch, Danish, or French--whatever seemed to him to suit his purpose.\r\nBut soon the geographical proximity to Germany, the annexation of\r\nthe Baltic Provinces in which the civilisation was German, and\r\nintermarriages between the Imperial family and various German dynasties,\r\ngave to German influence a decided preponderance. When the Empress Anne,\r\nPeter\u0027s niece, who had been Duchess of Courland, entrusted the whole\r\nadministration of the country to her favourite Biron, the German\r\ninfluence became almost exclusive, and the Court, the official world,\r\nand the schools were Germanised.\r\n\r\nThe harsh, cruel, tyrannical rule of Biron produced a strong reaction,\r\nending in a revolution, which raised to the throne the Princess\r\nElizabeth, Peter\u0027s unmarried daughter, who had lived in retirement and\r\nneglect during the German regime. She was expected to rid the country of\r\nforeigners, and she did what she could to fulfil the expectations that\r\nwere entertained of her. With loud protestations of patriotic feelings,\r\nshe removed the Germans from all important posts, demanded that in\r\nfuture the members of the Academy should be chosen from among born\r\nRussians, and gave orders that the Russian youth should be carefully\r\nprepared for all kinds of official activity.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to throw off the German bondage did not lead to\r\nintellectual independence. During Peter\u0027s violent reforms Russia had\r\nruthlessly thrown away her own historic past with whatever germs it\r\ncontained, and now she possessed none of the elements of a genuine\r\nnational culture. She was in the position of a fugitive who has escaped\r\nfrom slavery, and, finding himself in danger of starvation, looks\r\nabout for a new master. The upper classes, who had acquired a taste for\r\nforeign civilisation, no sooner threw off everything German than they\r\nsought some other civilisation to put in its place. And they could not\r\nlong hesitate in making a choice, for at that time all who thought of\r\nculture and refinement turned their eyes to Paris and Versailles. All\r\nthat was most brilliant and refined was to be found at the Court of\r\nthe French kings, under whose patronage the art and literature of the\r\nRenaissance had attained their highest development. Even Germany, which\r\nhad resisted the ambitious designs of Louis XIV., imitated the manners\r\nof his Court. Every petty German potentate strove to ape the pomp and\r\ndignity of the Grand Monarque; and the courtiers, affecting to look on\r\neverything German as rude and barbarous, adopted French fashions, and\r\nspoke a hybrid jargon which they considered much more elegant than the\r\nplain mother tongue. In a word, Gallomania had become the prevailing\r\nsocial epidemic of the time, and it could not fail to attack and\r\nmetamorphose such a class as the Russian Noblesse, which possessed few\r\nstubborn deep-rooted national convictions.\r\n\r\nAt first the French influence was manifested chiefly in external\r\nforms--that is to say, in dress, manners, language, and upholstery--but\r\ngradually, and very rapidly after the accession of Catherine II., the\r\nfriend of Voltaire and the Encyclopaedists, it sank deeper. Every\r\nnoble who had pretensions to being \"civilised\" learned to speak\r\nFrench fluently, and gained some superficial acquaintance with French\r\nliterature. The tragedies of Corneille and Racine and the comedies of\r\nMoliere were played regularly at the Court theatre in presence of the\r\nEmpress, and awakened a real or affected enthusiasm among the audience.\r\nFor those who preferred reading in their native language, numerous\r\ntranslations were published, a simple list of which would fill\r\nseveral pages. Among them we find not only Voltaire, Rousseau, Lesage,\r\nMarmontel, and other favourite French authors, but also all the\r\nmasterpieces of European literature, ancient and modern, which at that\r\ntime enjoyed a high reputation in the French literary world--Homer and\r\nDemosthenes, Cicero and Virgil, Ariosto and Camoens, Milton and Locke,\r\nSterne and Fielding.\r\n\r\nIt is related of Byron that he never wrote a description whilst the\r\nscene was actually before him; and this fact points to an important\r\npsychological principle. The human mind, so long as it is compelled\r\nto strain the receptive faculties, cannot engage in that \"poetic\"\r\nactivity--to use the term in its Greek sense--which is commonly called\r\n\"original creation.\" And as with individuals, so with nations. By\r\naccepting in a lump a foreign culture a nation inevitably condemns\r\nitself for a time to intellectual sterility. So long as it is occupied\r\nin receiving and assimilating a flood of new ideas, unfamiliar\r\nconceptions, and foreign modes of thought, it will produce nothing\r\noriginal, and the result of its highest efforts will be merely\r\nsuccessful imitation. We need not be surprised therefore to find that\r\nthe Russians, in becoming acquainted with foreign literature, became\r\nimitators and plagiarists. In this kind of work their natural pliancy\r\nof mind and powerful histrionic talent made them wonderfully successful.\r\nOdes, pseudo-classical tragedies, satirical comedies, epic poems,\r\nelegies, and all the other recognised forms of poetical composition,\r\nappeared in great profusion, and many of the writers acquired a\r\nremarkable command over their native language, which had hitherto been\r\nregarded as uncouth and barbarous. But in all this mass of imitative\r\nliterature, which has since fallen into well-merited oblivion, there\r\nare very few traces of genuine originality. To obtain the title of\r\nthe Russian Racine, the Russian Lafontaine, the Russian Pindar, or the\r\nRussian Homer, was at that time the highest aim of Russian literary\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nTogether with the fashionable literature the Russian educated classes\r\nadopted something of the fashionable philosophy. They were peculiarly\r\nunfitted to resist that hurricane of \"enlightenment\" which swept over\r\nEurope during the latter half of the eighteenth century, first\r\nbreaking or uprooting the received philosophical systems, theological\r\nconceptions, and scientific theories, and then shaking to their\r\nfoundations the existing political and social institutions. The Russian\r\nNoblesse had neither the traditional conservative spirit, nor the firm,\r\nwell-reasoned, logical beliefs which in England and Germany formed a\r\npowerful barrier against the spread of French influence. They had been\r\ntoo recently metamorphosed, and were too eager to acquire a foreign\r\ncivilisation, to have even the germs of a conservative spirit. The\r\nrapidity and violence with which Peter\u0027s reforms had been effected,\r\ntogether with the peculiar spirit of Greek Orthodoxy and the low\r\nintellectual level of the clergy, had prevented theology from\r\nassociating itself with the new order of things. The upper classes had\r\nbecome estranged from the beliefs of their forefathers without acquiring\r\nother beliefs to supply the place of those which had been lost. The\r\nold religious conceptions were inseparably interwoven with what was\r\nrecognised as antiquated and barbarous, whilst the new philosophical\r\nideas were associated with all that was modern and civilised. Besides\r\nthis, the sovereign, Catherine II., who enjoyed the unbounded admiration\r\nof the upper classes, openly professed allegiance to the new philosophy,\r\nand sought the advice and friendship of its high priests. If we bear\r\nin mind these facts we shall not be surprised to find among the Russian\r\nnobles of that time a considerable number of so-called \"Voltaireans\"\r\nand numerous unquestioning believers in the infallibility of the\r\nEncyclopedie. What is a little more surprising is, that the new\r\nphilosophy sometimes found its way into the ecclesiastical seminaries.\r\nThe famous Speranski relates that in the seminary of St. Petersburg one\r\nof his professors, when not in a state of intoxication, was in the habit\r\nof preaching the doctrines of Voltaire and Diderot!\r\n\r\nThe rise of the sentimental school in Western Europe produced an\r\nimportant change in Russian literature, by undermining the inordinate\r\nadmiration for the French pseudo-classical school. Florian, Richardson,\r\nSterne, Rousseau, and Bernardin de St. Pierre found first translators,\r\nand then imitators, and soon the loud-sounding declamation and wordy\r\necstatic despair of the stage heroes were drowned in the deep-drawn\r\nsighs and plaintive wailings of amorous swains and peasant-maids\r\nforsaken. The mania seems to have been in Russia even more severe than\r\nin the countries where it originated. Full-grown, bearded men wept\r\nbecause they had not been born in peaceful primitive times, \"when all\r\nmen were shepherds and brothers.\" Hundreds of sighing youths and maidens\r\nvisited the scenes described by the sentimental writers, and wandered\r\nby the rivers and ponds in which despairing heroines had drowned\r\nthemselves. People talked, wrote, and meditated about \"the sympathy\r\nof hearts created for each other,\" \"the soft communion of sympathetic\r\nsouls,\" and much more of the same kind. Sentimental journeys became\r\na favourite amusement, and formed the subject of very popular books,\r\ncontaining maudlin absurdities likely to produce nowadays mirth rather\r\nthan tears. One traveller, for instance, throws himself on his knees\r\nbefore an old oak and makes a speech to it; another weeps daily on the\r\ngrave of a favourite dog, and constantly longs to marry a peasant girl;\r\na third talks love to the moon, sends kisses to the stars, and wishes to\r\npress the heavenly orbs to his bosom! For a time the public would read\r\nnothing but absurd productions of this sort, and Karamzin, the great\r\nliterary authority of the time, expressly declared that the true\r\nfunction of Art was \"to disseminate agreeable impressions in the region\r\nof the sentimental.\"\r\n\r\nThe love of French philosophy vanished as suddenly as the inordinate\r\nadmiration of the French pseudo-classical literature. When the great\r\nRevolution broke out in Paris the fashionable philosophic literature in\r\nSt. Petersburg disappeared. Men who talked about political freedom\r\nand the rights of man, without thinking for a moment of limiting\r\nthe autocratic power or of emancipating their serfs, were naturally\r\nsurprised and frightened on discovering what the liberal principles\r\ncould effect when applied to real life. Horrified by the awful scenes of\r\nthe Terror, they hastened to divest themselves of the principles which\r\nled to such results, and sank into a kind of optimistic conservatism\r\nthat harmonised well with the virtuous sentimentalism in vogue. In this\r\nthe Empress herself gave the example. The Imperial disciple and friend\r\nof the Encyclopaedists became in the last years of her reign a decided\r\nreactionnaire.\r\n\r\nDuring the Napoleonic wars, when the patriotic feelings were excited,\r\nthere was a violent hostility to foreign intellectual influence; and\r\nfeeble intermittent attempts were made to throw off the intellectual\r\nbondage. The invasion of the country in 1812 by the Grande Armee, and\r\nthe burning of Moscow, added abundant fuel to this patriotic fire. For\r\nsome time any one who ventured to express even a moderate admiration for\r\nFrench culture incurred the risk of being stigmatised as a traitor to\r\nhis country and a renegade to the national faith. But this patriotic\r\nfanaticism soon evaporated, and exaggerations of the ultra-national\r\nparty became the object of satire and parody. When the political danger\r\nwas past, and people resumed their ordinary occupations, those who\r\nloved foreign literature returned to their old favourites--or, as the\r\nultra-patriots called it, to their \"wallowing in the mire\"--simply\r\nbecause the native literature did not supply them with what they\r\ndesired. \"We are quite ready,\" they said to their upbraiders, \"to admire\r\nyour great works as soon as they appear, but in the meantime please\r\nallow us to enjoy what we possess.\" Thus in the last years of the reign\r\nof Alexander I. the patriotic opposition to West European literature\r\ngradually ceased, and a new period of unrestricted intellectual\r\nimportation began.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merchandise now brought into the country was very\r\ndifferent from that which had been imported in the time of Catherine.\r\nThe French Revolution, the Napoleonic domination, the patriotic wars,\r\nthe restoration of the Bourbons, and the other great events of that\r\nmemorable epoch, had in the interval produced profound changes in the\r\nintellectual as well as the political condition of Western Europe.\r\nDuring the Napoleonic wars Russia had become closely associated with\r\nGermany; and now the peculiar intellectual fermentation which was going\r\non among the German educated classes was reflected in the society of St.\r\nPetersburg. It did not appear, indeed, in the printed literature, for\r\nthe Press-censure had been recently organised on the principles laid\r\ndown by Metternich, but it was none the less violent on that account.\r\nWhilst the periodicals were filled with commonplace meditations on\r\nyouth, spring, the love of Art, and similar innocent topics, the young\r\ngeneration was discussing in the salons all the burning questions which\r\nMetternich and his adherents were endeavouring to extinguish.\r\n\r\nThese discussions, if discussions they might be called, were not of\r\na very serious kind. In true dilettante style the fashionable young\r\nphilosophers culled from the newest books the newest thoughts and\r\ntheories, and retailed them in the salon or the ballroom. And they were\r\nalways sure to find attentive listeners. The more astounding the idea\r\nor dogma, the more likely was it to be favourably received. No matter\r\nwhether it came from the Rationalists, the Mystics, the Freemasons, or\r\nthe Methodists, it was certain to find favour, provided it was novel and\r\npresented in an elegant form. The eclectic minds of that curious time\r\ncould derive equal satisfaction from the brilliant discourses of the\r\nreactionary jesuitical De Maistre, the revolutionary odes of Pushkin,\r\nand the mysticism of Frau von Krudener. For the majority the vague\r\ntheosophic doctrines and the projects for a spiritual union of\r\ngovernments and peoples had perhaps the greatest charm, being specially\r\ncommended by the fact that they enjoyed the protection and sympathy\r\nof the Emperor. Pious souls discovered in the mystical lucubrations\r\nof Jung-Stilling and Baader the final solution of all existing\r\ndifficulties--political, social, and philosophical. Men of less dreamy\r\ntemperament put their faith in political economy and constitutional\r\ntheories, and sought a foundation for their favourite schemes in\r\nthe past history of the country and in the supposed fundamental\r\npeculiarities of the national character. Like the young German\r\ndemocrats, who were then talking enthusiastically about Teutons,\r\nCheruskers, Skalds, the shade of Arminius, and the heroes of the\r\nNiebelungen, these young Russian savants recognised in early Russian\r\nhistory--when reconstructed according to their own fancy--lofty\r\npolitical ideals, and dreamed of resuscitating the ancient institutions\r\nin all their pristine imaginary splendour.\r\n\r\nEach age has its peculiar social and political panaceas. One generation\r\nputs its trust in religion, another in philanthropy, a third in written\r\nconstitutions, a fourth in universal suffrage, a fifth in popular\r\neducation. In the Epoch of the Restoration, as it is called, the\r\nfavourite panacea all over the Continent was secret political\r\nassociation. Very soon after the overthrow of Napoleon the peoples who\r\nhad risen in arms to obtain political independence discovered that they\r\nhad merely changed masters. The Princes reconstructed Europe according\r\nto their own convenience, without paying much attention to patriotic\r\naspirations, and forgot their promises of liberal institutions as soon\r\nas they were again firmly seated on their thrones. This was naturally\r\nfor many a bitter deception. The young generation, excluded from all\r\nshare in political life and gagged by the stringent police supervision,\r\nsought to realise its political aspirations by means of secret\r\nsocieties, resembling more or less the Masonic brotherhoods. There were\r\nthe Burschenschaften in Germany; the Union, and the \"Aide toi et le ciel\r\nt\u0027aidera,\" in France; the Order of the Hammer in Spain; the Carbonari in\r\nItaly; and the Hetairai in Greece. In Russia the young nobles followed\r\nthe prevailing fashion. Secret societies were formed, and in December,\r\n1825, an attempt was made to raise a military insurrection in St.\r\nPetersburg, for the purpose of deposing the Imperial family and\r\nproclaiming a republic; but the attempt failed, and the vague Utopian\r\ndreams of the romantic would-be reformers were swept away by grape-shot.\r\n\r\nThis \"December catastrophe,\" still vividly remembered, was for the\r\nsociety of St. Petersburg like the giving way of the floor in a crowded\r\nball-room. But a moment before, all had been animated, careless, and\r\nhappy; now consternation was depicted on every face. The salons, that\r\nbut yesterday had been ringing with lively discussions on morals,\r\naesthetics, politics, and theology, were now silent and deserted. Many\r\nof those who had been wont to lead the causeries had been removed to the\r\ncells of the fortress, and those who had not been arrested trembled for\r\nthemselves or their friends; for nearly all had of late dabbled more\r\nor less in the theory and practice of revolution. The announcement\r\nthat five of the conspirators had been condemned to the gallows and\r\nthe others sentenced to transportation did not tend to calm the\r\nconsternation. Society was like a discomfited child, who, amidst the\r\ndelight and excitement of letting off fireworks, has had its fingers\r\nseverely burnt.\r\n\r\nThe sentimental, wavering Alexander I. had been succeeded by his stern,\r\nenergetic brother Nicholas, and the command went forth that there should\r\nbe no more fireworks, no more dilettante philosophising or political\r\naspirations. There was, however, little need for such an order. Society\r\nhad been, for the moment at least, effectually cured of all tendencies\r\nto political dreaming. It had discovered, to its astonishment and\r\ndismay, that these new ideas, which were to bring temporal salvation to\r\nhumanity, and to make all men happy, virtuous, refined, and poetical,\r\nled in reality to exile and the scaffold! The pleasant dream was at an\r\nend, and the fashionable world, giving up its former habits, took to\r\nharmless occupations--card-playing, dissipation, and the reading of\r\nFrench light literature. \"The French quadrille,\" as a writer of the time\r\ntersely expresses it, \"has taken the place of Adam Smith.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the storm had passed, the life of the salons began anew, but it was\r\nvery different from what it had been. There was no longer any talk about\r\npolitical economy, theology, popular education, administrative abuses,\r\nsocial and political reforms. Everything that had any relation to\r\npolitics in the wider sense of the term was by tacit consent avoided.\r\nDiscussions there were as of old, but they were now confined to literary\r\ntopics, theories of art, and similar innocent subjects.\r\n\r\nThis indifference or positive repugnance to philosophy and political\r\nscience, strengthened and prolonged by the repressive system of\r\nadministration adopted by Nicholas, was of course fatal to the\r\nmany-sided intellectual activity which had flourished during the\r\npreceding reign, but it was by no means unfavourable to the cultivation\r\nof imaginative literature. On the contrary, by excluding those practical\r\ninterests which tend to disturb artistic production and to engross the\r\nattention of the public, it fostered what was called in the phraseology\r\nof that time \"the pure-hearted worship of the Muses.\" We need not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised to find that the reign of Nicholas, which\r\nis commonly and not unjustly described as an epoch of social and\r\nintellectual stagnation, may be called in a certain sense the Golden Age\r\nof Russian literature.\r\n\r\nAlready in the preceding reign the struggle between the Classical and\r\nthe Romantic school--between the adherents of traditional aesthetic\r\nprinciples and the partisans of untrammelled poetic inspiration--which\r\nwas being carried on in Western Europe, was reflected in Russia. A group\r\nof young men belonging to the aristocratic society of St. Petersburg\r\nembraced with enthusiasm the new doctrines, and declared war against\r\n\"classicism,\" under which term they understood all that was antiquated,\r\ndry, and pedantic. Discarding the stately, lumbering, unwieldy periods\r\nwhich had hitherto been in fashion, they wrote a light, elastic,\r\nvigorous style, and formed a literary society for the express purpose of\r\nridiculing the most approved classical writers. The new principles\r\nfound many adherents, and the new style many admirers, but this only\r\nintensified the hostility of the literary Conservatives. The staid,\r\nrespectable leaders of the old school, who had all their lives kept the\r\nfear of Boileau before their eyes and considered his precepts as the\r\ninfallible utterances of aesthetic wisdom, thundered against the impious\r\ninnovations as unmistakable symptoms of literary decline and moral\r\ndegeneracy--representing the boisterous young iconoclasts as dissipated\r\nDon Juans and dangerous freethinkers.\r\n\r\nThus for some time in Russia, as in Western Europe, \"a terrible war\r\nraged on Parnassus.\" At first the Government frowned at the innovators,\r\non account of certain revolutionary odes which one of their number had\r\nwritten; but when the Romantic Muse, having turned away from the present\r\nas essentially prosaic, went back into the distant past and soared into\r\nthe region of sublime abstractions, the most keen-eyed Press Censors\r\nfound no reason to condemn her worship, and the authorities placed\r\nalmost no restrictions on free poetic inspiration. Romantic poetry\r\nacquired the protection of the Government and the patronage of the\r\nCourt, and the names of Zhukofski, Pushkin, and Lermontof--the three\r\nchief representatives of the Russian Romantic school--became household\r\nwords in all ranks of the educated classes.\r\n\r\nThese three great luminaries of the literary world were of course\r\nattended by a host of satellites of various magnitudes, who did all\r\nin their power to refute the romantic principles by reductiones ad\r\nabsurdum. Endowed for the most part with considerable facility of\r\ncomposition, the poetasters poured forth their feelings with torrential\r\nrecklessness, demanding freedom for their inspiration, and cursing the\r\nage that fettered them with its prosaic cares, its cold reason, and\r\nits dry science. At the same time the dramatists and novelists created\r\nheroes of immaculate character and angelic purity, endowed with all the\r\ncardinal virtues in the superlative degree; and, as a contrast to these,\r\nterrible Satanic personages with savage passions, gleaming daggers,\r\ndeadly poisons, and all manner of aimless melodramatic villainy.\r\nThese stilted productions, interspersed with light satirical essays,\r\nhistorical sketches, literary criticism, and amusing anecdotes, formed\r\nthe contents of the periodical literature, and completely satisfied\r\nthe wants of the reading public. Almost no one at that time took\r\nany interest in public affairs or foreign politics. The acts of the\r\nGovernment which were watched most attentively were the promotions in\r\nthe service and the conferring of decorations. The publication of a\r\nnew tale by Zagoskin or Marlinski--two writers now well-nigh\r\nforgotten--seemed of much greater importance than any amount of\r\nlegislation, and such events as the French Revolution of 1830 paled\r\nbefore the publication of a new poem by Pushkin.\r\n\r\nThe Transcendental philosophy, which in Germany went hand in hand with\r\nthe Romantic literature, found likewise a faint reflection in Russia. A\r\nnumber of young professors and students in Moscow, who had become\r\nardent admirers of German literature, passed from the works of Schiller,\r\nGoethe, and Hoffmann to the writing of Schelling and Hegel. Trained in\r\nthe Romantic school, these young philosophers found at first a special\r\ncharm in Schelling\u0027s mystical system, teeming with hazy poetical\r\nmetaphors, and presenting a misty grandiose picture of the universe;\r\nbut gradually they felt the want of some logical basis for their\r\nspeculations, and Hegel became their favourite. Gallantly they struggled\r\nwith the uncouth terminology and epigrammatic paradoxes of the great\r\nthinker, and strove to force their way through the intricate mazes of\r\nhis logical formulae. With the ardour of neophytes they looked at every\r\nphenomenon--even the most trivial incident of common life--from the\r\nphilosophical point of view, talked day and night about principles,\r\nideas, subjectivity, Weltauffassung, and similar abstract entities,\r\nand habitually attacked the \"hydra of unphilosophy\" by analysing the\r\nphenomena presented and relegating the ingredient elements to the\r\nrecognised categories. In ordinary life they were men of quiet, grave,\r\ncontemplative demeanour, but their faces could flush and their blood\r\nboil when they discussed the all-important question, whether it is\r\npossible to pass logically from Pure Being through Nonentity to the\r\nconception of Development and Definite Existence!\r\n\r\nWe know how in Western Europe Romanticism and Transcendentalism,\r\nin their various forms, sank into oblivion, and were replaced by a\r\nliterature which had a closer connection with ordinary prosaic wants and\r\nplain everyday life. The educated public became weary of the Romantic\r\nwriters, who were always \"sighing like a furnace,\" delighting in\r\nsolitude, cold eternity, and moonshine, deluging the world with their\r\nheart-gushings, and calling on the heavens and the earth to stand aghast\r\nat their Promethean agonising or their Wertherean despair. Healthy\r\nhuman nature revolted against the poetical enthusiasts who had lost\r\nthe faculty of seeing things in their natural light, and who constantly\r\nindulged in that morbid self-analysis which is fatal to genuine feeling\r\nand vigorous action. And in this healthy reaction the philosophers fared\r\nno better than the poets, with whom, indeed, they had much in common.\r\nShutting their eyes to the visible world around them, they had busied\r\nthemselves with burrowing in the mysterious depths of Absolute Being,\r\ngrappling with the ego and the non-ego, constructing the great\r\nworld, visible and invisible, out of their own puny internal\r\nself-consciousness, endeavouring to appropriate all departments of human\r\nthought, and imparting to every subject they touched the dryness and\r\nrigidity of an algebraical formula. Gradually men with real human\r\nsympathies began to perceive that from all this philosophical turmoil\r\nlittle real advantage was to be derived. It became only too evident\r\nthat the philosophers were perfectly reconciled with all the evil in the\r\nworld, provided it did not contradict their theories; that they were men\r\nof the same type as the physician in Moliere\u0027s comedy, whose chief care\r\nwas that his patients should die selon les ordonnances de la medicine.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the reaction first appeared in the aesthetic literature. Its\r\nfirst influential representative was Gogol (b. 1808, d. 1852), who may\r\nbe called, in a certain sense, the Russian Dickens. A minute comparison\r\nof those two great humourists would perhaps show as many points of\r\ncontrast as of similarity, but there is a strong superficial resemblance\r\nbetween them. They both possessed an inexhaustible supply of broad\r\nhumour and an imagination of singular vividness. Both had the power of\r\nseeing the ridiculous side of common things, and the talent of producing\r\ncaricatures that had a wonderful semblance of reality. A little calm\r\nreflection would suffice to show that the characters presented are for\r\nthe most part psychological impossibilities; but on first making their\r\nacquaintance we are so struck with one or two life-like characteristics\r\nand various little details dexterously introduced, and at the same time\r\nwe are so carried away by the overflowing fun of the narrative, that we\r\nhave neither time nor inclination to use our critical faculties. In a\r\nvery short time Gogol\u0027s fame spread throughout the length and breadth\r\nof the Empire, and many of his characters became as familiar to\r\nhis countrymen as Sam Weller and Mrs. Gamp were to Englishmen. His\r\ndescriptions were so graphic--so like the world which everybody knew!\r\nThe characters seemed to be old acquaintances hit off to the life; and\r\nreaders revelled in that peculiar pleasure which most of us derive from\r\nseeing our friends successfully mimicked. Even the Iron Tsar could not\r\nresist the fun and humour of \"The Inspector\" (Revizor), and not only\r\nlaughed heartily, but also protected the author against the tyranny of\r\nthe literary censors, who considered that the piece was not written in\r\na sufficiently \"well-intentioned\" tone. In a word, the reading public\r\nlaughed as it had never laughed before, and this wholesome genuine\r\nmerriment did much to destroy the morbid appetite for Byronic heroes and\r\nRomantic affectation.\r\n\r\nThe Romantic Muse did not at once abdicate, but with the spread of\r\nGogol\u0027s popularity her reign was practically at an end. In vain some\r\nof the conservative critics decried the new favourite as talentless,\r\nprosaic, and vulgar. The public were not to be robbed of their amusement\r\nfor the sake of any abstract aesthetic considerations; and young\r\nauthors, taking Gogol for their model, chose their subjects from real\r\nlife, and endeavoured to delineate with minute truthfulness.\r\n\r\nThis new intellectual movement was at first purely literary, and\r\naffected merely the manner of writing novels, tales, and poems. The\r\ncritics who had previously demanded beauty of form and elegance\r\nof expression now demanded accuracy of description, condemned the\r\naspirations towards so-called high art, and praised loudly those who\r\nproduced the best literary photographs. But authors and critics did\r\nnot long remain on this purely aesthetic standpoint. The authors, in\r\ndescribing reality, began to indicate moral approval and condemnation,\r\nand the critics began to pass from the criticism of the representations\r\nto the criticism of the realities represented. A poem or a tale was\r\noften used as a peg on which to hang a moral lecture, and the fictitious\r\ncharacters were soundly rated for their sins of omission and commission.\r\nMuch was said about the defence of the oppressed, female emancipation,\r\nhonour, and humanitarianism; and ridicule was unsparingly launched\r\nagainst all forms of ignorance, apathy, and the spirit of routine.\r\nThe ordinary refrain was that the public ought now to discard what was\r\nformerly regarded as poetical and sublime, and to occupy itself with\r\npractical concerns--with the real wants of social life.\r\n\r\nThe literary movement was thus becoming a movement in favour of social\r\nand political reforms when it was suddenly arrested by political\r\nevents in the West. The February Revolution in Paris, and the political\r\nfermentation which appeared during 1848-49 in almost every country of\r\nEurope, alarmed the Emperor Nicholas and his counsellors. A Russian army\r\nwas sent into Austria to suppress the Hungarian insurrection and save\r\nthe Hapsburg dynasty, and the most stringent measures were taken\r\nto prevent disorders at home. One of the first precautions for the\r\npreservation of domestic tranquillity was to muzzle the Press more\r\nfirmly than before, and to silence the aspirations towards reform and\r\nprogress; thenceforth nothing could be printed which was not in strict\r\naccordance with the ultra-patriotic theory of Russian history, as\r\nexpressed by a leading official personage: \"The past has been admirable,\r\nthe present is more than magnificent, and the future will surpass\r\nall that the human imagination can conceive!\" The alarm caused by the\r\nrevolutionary disorders spread to the non-official world, and gave rise\r\nto much patriotic self-congratulation. \"The nations of the West,\" it was\r\nsaid, \"envy us, and if they knew us better--if they could see how happy\r\nand prosperous we are--they would envy us still more. We ought not,\r\nhowever, to withdraw from Europe our solicitude; its hostility should\r\nnot deprive us of our high mission of saving order and restoring rest\r\nto the nations; we ought to teach them to obey authority as we do. It is\r\nfor us to introduce the saving principle of order into a world that has\r\nfallen a prey to anarchy. Russia ought not to abandon that mission which\r\nhas been entrusted to her by the heavenly and by the earthly Tsar.\"*\r\n\r\n     * These words were written by Tchaadaef, who, a few years\r\n     before, had vigorously attacked the Slavophils for enouncing\r\n     similar views.\r\n\r\nMen who saw in the significant political eruption of 1848 nothing but\r\nan outburst of meaningless, aimless anarchy, and who believed that their\r\ncountry was destined to restore order throughout the civilised world,\r\nhad of course little time or inclination to think of putting their\r\nown house in order. No one now spoke of the necessity of social\r\nreorganisation: the recently awakened aspirations and expectations\r\nseemed to be completely forgotten. The critics returned to their old\r\ntheory that art and literature should be cultivated for their own sake\r\nand not used as a vehicle for the propagation of ideas foreign to their\r\nnature. It seemed, in short, as if all the prolific ideas which had for\r\na time occupied the public attention had been merely \"writ in water,\"\r\nand had now disappeared without leaving a trace behind them.\r\n\r\nIn reality the new movement was destined to reappear very soon with\r\ntenfold force; but the account of its reappearance and development\r\nbelongs to a future chapter. Meanwhile I may formulate the general\r\nconclusion to be drawn from the foregoing pages. Ever since the time of\r\nPeter the Great there has been such a close connection between Russia\r\nand Western Europe that every intellectual movement which has appeared\r\nin France and Germany has been reflected--albeit in an exaggerated,\r\ndistorted form--in the educated society of St. Petersburg and Moscow.\r\nThus the window which Peter opened in order to enable his subjects to\r\nlook into Europe has well served its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Nicholas and his System--The Men with Aspirations and the\r\nApathetically Contented--National Humiliation--Popular Discontent\r\nand the Manuscript Literature--Death of Nicholas--Alexander II.--New\r\nSpirit--Reform Enthusiasm--Change in the Periodical Literature--The\r\nKolokol--The Conservatives--The Tchinovniks--First Specific\r\nProposals--Joint-Stock Companies--The Serf Question Comes to the Front.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Russians frankly admit that they were beaten in the Crimean War, but\r\nthey regard the heroic defence of Sebastopol as one of the most glorious\r\nevents in the military annals of their country. Nor do they altogether\r\nregret the result of the struggle. Often in a half-jocular, half-serious\r\ntone they say that they had reason to be grateful to the Allies. And\r\nthere is much truth in this paradoxical statement. The Crimean War\r\ninaugurated a new epoch in the national history. It gave the death-blow\r\nto the repressive system of the Emperor Nicholas, and produced an\r\nintellectual movement and a moral revival which led to gigantic results.\r\n\r\n\"The affair of December,\" 1825--I mean the abortive attempt at a\r\nmilitary insurrection in St. Petersburg, to which I have alluded in\r\nthe foregoing chapter--gave the key-note to Nicholas\u0027s reign. The armed\r\nattempt to overthrow the Imperial power, ending in the execution or\r\nexile of many young members of the first families, struck terror into\r\nthe Noblesse, and prepared the way for a period of repressive police\r\nadministration. Nicholas had none of the moral limpness and vacillating\r\ncharacter of his predecessor. His was one of those simple, vigorous,\r\ntenacious, straightforward natures--more frequently to be met with\r\namong the Teutonic than among the Slav races--whose conceptions are all\r\nfounded on a few deep-rooted, semi-instinctive convictions, and who are\r\nutterly incapable of accommodating themselves with histrionic cleverness\r\nto the changes of external circumstances. From his early youth he had\r\nshown a strong liking for military discipline and a decided repugnance\r\nto the humanitarianism and liberal principles then in fashion. With\r\n\"the rights of man,\" \"the spirit of the age,\" and similar philosophical\r\nabstractions his strong, domineering nature had no sympathy; and for\r\nthe vague, loud-sounding phrases of philosophic liberalism he had a most\r\nprofound contempt. \"Attend to your military duties,\" he was wont to say\r\nto his officers before his accession; \"don\u0027t trouble your heads with\r\nphilosophy. I cannot bear philosophers!\" The tragic event which formed\r\nthe prelude to his reign naturally confirmed and fortified his previous\r\nconvictions. The representatives of liberalism, who could talk so\r\neloquently about duty in the abstract, had, whilst wearing the uniform\r\nof the Imperial Guard, openly disobeyed the repeated orders of their\r\nsuperior officers and attempted to shake the allegiance of the troops\r\nfor the purpose of overthrowing the Imperial power! A man who was at\r\nonce soldier and autocrat, by nature as well as by position, could of\r\ncourse admit no extenuating circumstances. The incident stereotyped his\r\ncharacter for life, and made him the sworn enemy of liberalism and\r\nthe fanatical defender of autocracy, not only in his own country, but\r\nthroughout Europe. In European politics he saw two forces struggling\r\nfor mastery--monarchy and democracy, which were in his opinion identical\r\nwith order and anarchy; and he was always ready to assist his brother\r\nsovereigns in putting down democratic movements. In his own Empire he\r\nendeavoured by every means in his power to prevent the introduction\r\nof the dangerous ideas. For this purpose a stringent intellectual\r\nquarantine was established on the western frontier. All foreign books\r\nand newspapers, except those of the most harmless kind, were rigorously\r\nexcluded. Native writers were placed under strict supervision, and\r\nperemptorily silenced as soon as they departed from what was considered\r\na \"well-intentioned\" tone. The number of university students was\r\ndiminished, the chairs for political science were suppressed, and the\r\nmilitary schools multiplied. Russians were prevented from travelling\r\nabroad, and foreigners who visited the country were closely watched by\r\nthe police. By these and similar measures it was hoped that Russia would\r\nbe preserved from the dangers of revolutionary agitation.\r\n\r\nNicholas has been called the Don Quixote of Autocracy, and the\r\ncomparison which the term implies is true in many points. By character\r\nand aims he belonged to a time that had passed away; but failure and\r\nmishap could not shake his faith in his ideal, and made no change in his\r\nhonest, stubborn nature, which was as loyal and chivalresque as that\r\nof the ill-fated Knight of La Mancha. In spite of all evidence to the\r\ncontrary, he believed in the practical omnipotence of autocracy. He\r\nimagined that as his authority was theoretically unlimited, so his power\r\ncould work miracles. By nature and training a soldier, he considered\r\ngovernment a slightly modified form of military discipline, and looked\r\non the nation as an army which might be made to perform any intellectual\r\nor economic evolutions that he might see fit to command. All social ills\r\nseemed to him the consequence of disobedience to his orders, and he\r\nknew only one remedy--more discipline. Any expression of doubt as to\r\nthe wisdom of his policy, or any criticism of existing regulations, he\r\ntreated as an act of insubordination which a wise sovereign ought not\r\nto tolerate. If he never said, \"L\u0027Etat--c\u0027est moi!\" it was because he\r\nconsidered the fact so self-evident that it did not need to be stated.\r\nHence any attack on the administration, even in the person of the most\r\ninsignificant official, was an attack on himself and on the monarchical\r\nprinciple which he represented. The people must believe--and faith, as\r\nwe know, comes not by sight--that they lived under the best possible\r\ngovernment. To doubt this was political heresy. An incautious word or a\r\nfoolish joke against the Government was considered a serious crime, and\r\nmight be punished by a long exile in some distant and inhospitable part\r\nof the Empire. Progress should by all means be made, but it must be made\r\nby word of command, and in the way ordered. Private initiative in any\r\nform was a thing on no account to be tolerated. Nicholas never\r\nsuspected that a ruler, however well-intentioned, energetic, and legally\r\nautocratic he may be, can do but little without the co-operation of\r\nhis people. Experience constantly showed him the fruitlessness of his\r\nefforts, but he paid no attention to its teachings. He had formed\r\nonce for all his theory of government, and for thirty years he acted\r\naccording to it with all the blindness and obstinacy of a reckless,\r\nfanatical doctrinaire. Even at the close of his reign, when the terrible\r\nlogic of facts had proved his system to be a mistake--when his armies\r\nhad been defeated, his best fleet destroyed, his ports blockaded, and\r\nhis treasury well-nigh emptied--he could not recant. \"My successor,\" he\r\nis reported to have said on his deathbed, \"may do as he pleases, but I\r\ncannot change.\"\r\n\r\nHad Nicholas lived in the old patriarchal times, when kings were the\r\nuncontrolled \"shepherds of the people,\" he would perhaps have been\r\nan admirable ruler; but in the nineteenth century he was a flagrant\r\nanachronism. His system of administration completely broke down. In vain\r\nhe multiplied formalities and inspectors, and punished severely the few\r\ndelinquents who happened by some accident to be brought to justice; the\r\nofficials continued to pilfer, extort, and misgovern in every possible\r\nway. Though the country was reduced to what would be called in Europe\r\n\"a state of siege,\" the inhabitants might still have said--as they are\r\nreported to have declared a thousand years before--\"Our land is great\r\nand fertile, but there is no order in it.\"\r\n\r\nIn a nation accustomed to political life and to a certain amount of\r\nself-government, any approach to the system of Nicholas would, of\r\ncourse, have produced wide-spread dissatisfaction and violent hatred\r\nagainst the ruling power. But in Russia at that time no such feelings\r\nwere awakened. The educated classes--and a fortiori the uneducated--were\r\nprofoundly indifferent not only to political questions, but also to\r\nordinary public affairs, whether local or Imperial, and were quite\r\ncontent to leave them in the hands of those who were paid for attending\r\nto them. In common with the uneducated peasantry, the nobles had a\r\nboundless respect--one might almost say a superstitious reverence--not\r\nonly for the person, but also for the will of the Tsar, and were ready\r\nto show unquestioning obedience to his commands, so long as these did\r\nnot interfere with their accustomed mode of life. The Tsar desired them\r\nnot to trouble their heads with political questions, and to leave all\r\npublic matters to the care of the Administration; and in this respect\r\nthe Imperial will coincided so well with their personal inclinations\r\nthat they had no difficulty in complying with it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tsar ordered those of them who held office to refrain from\r\nextortion and peculation, his orders were not so punctiliously obeyed,\r\nbut in this disobedience there was no open opposition--no assertion of\r\na right to pilfer and extort. As the disobedience proceeded, not from a\r\nfeeling of insubordination, but merely from the weakness that\r\nofficial flesh is heir to, it was not regarded as very heinous. In the\r\naristocratic circles of St. Petersburg and Moscow there was the same\r\nindifference to political questions and public affairs. All strove to\r\nhave the reputation of being \"well-intentioned,\" which was the first\r\nrequisite for those who desired Court favour or advancement in the\r\npublic service; and those whose attention was not entirely occupied\r\nwith official duties, card-playing, and the ordinary routine of everyday\r\nlife, cultivated belles-lettres or the fine arts. In short, the educated\r\nclasses in Russia at that time showed a complete indifference to\r\npolitical and social questions, an apathetic acquiescence in the\r\nsystem of administration adopted by the Government, and an unreasoning\r\ncontentment with the existing state of things.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1845, when the reaction against Romanticism was awakening\r\nin the reading public an interest in the affairs of real life,* began to\r\nappear what may be called \"the men with aspirations,\" a little band of\r\ngenerous enthusiasts, strongly resembling the youth in Longfellow\u0027s poem\r\nwho carries a banner with the device \"Excelsior,\" and strives ever to\r\nclimb higher, without having any clear notion of where he was going or\r\nof what he is to do when he reaches the summit. At first they had little\r\nmore than a sentimental enthusiasm for the true, the beautiful, and\r\nthe good, and a certain Platonic love for free institutions, liberty,\r\nenlightenment, progress, and everything that was generally comprehended\r\nat that period under the term \"liberal.\" Gradually, under the influence\r\nof current French literature, their ideas became a little clearer, and\r\nthey began to look on reality around them with a critical eye. They\r\ncould perceive, without much effort, the unrelenting tyranny of the\r\nAdministration, the notorious venality of the tribunals, the reckless\r\nsquandering of the public money, the miserable condition of the serfs,\r\nthe systematic strangulation of all independent opinion or private\r\ninitiative, and, above all, the profound apathy of the upper classes,\r\nwho seemed quite content with things as they were.\r\n\r\n     * Vide supra, p. 377 et seq.\r\n\r\nWith such ugly facts staring them in the face, and with the habit\r\nof looking at things from the moral point of view, these men could\r\nunderstand how hollow and false were the soothing or triumphant phrases\r\nof official optimism. They did not, indeed, dare to express their\r\nindignation publicly, for the authorities would allow no public\r\nexpression of dissatisfaction with the existing state of things, but\r\nthey disseminated their ideas among their friends and acquaintances by\r\nmeans of conversation and manuscript literature, and some of them, as\r\nuniversity professors and writers in the periodical Press, contrived to\r\nawaken in a certain section of the young generation an ardent enthusiasm\r\nfor enlightenment and progress, and a vague hope that a brighter day was\r\nabout to dawn.\r\n\r\nNot a few sympathised with these new conceptions and aspirations, but\r\nthe great majority of the nobles regarded them--especially after the\r\nFrench Revolution of 1848--as revolutionary and dangerous. Thus the\r\neducated classes became divided into two sections, which have sometimes\r\nbeen called the Liberals and the Conservatives, but which might be\r\nmore properly designated the men with aspirations and the apathetically\r\ncontented. These latter doubtless felt occasionally the irksomeness of\r\nthe existing system, but they had always one consolation--if they were\r\noppressed at home they were feared abroad. The Tsar was at least a\r\nthorough soldier, possessing an enormous and well-equipped army by\r\nwhich he might at any moment impose his will on Europe. Ever since the\r\nglorious days of 1812, when Napoleon was forced to make an ignominious\r\nretreat from the ruins of Moscow, the belief that the Russian soldiers\r\nwere superior to all others, and that the Russian army was invincible,\r\nhad become an article of the popular creed; and the respect which the\r\nvoice of Nicholas commanded in Western Europe seemed to prove that\r\nthe fact was admitted by foreign nations. In these and similar\r\nconsiderations the apathetically contented found a justification for\r\ntheir lethargy.\r\n\r\nWhen it became evident that Russia was about to engage in a trial of\r\nstrength with the Western Powers, this optimism became general. \"The\r\nheavy burdens,\" it was said, \"which the people have had to bear were\r\nnecessary to make Russia the first military Power in Europe, and now\r\nthe nation will reap the fruits of its long-suffering and patient\r\nresignation. The West will learn that her boasted liberty and liberal\r\ninstitutions are of little service in the hour of danger, and the\r\nRussians who admire such institutions will be constrained to admit\r\nthat a strong, all-directing autocracy is the only means of preserving\r\nnational greatness.\" As the patriotic fervour and military enthusiasm\r\nincreased, nothing was heard but praises of Nicholas and his system. The\r\nwar was regarded by many as a kind of crusade--even the Emperor spoke\r\nabout the defence of \"the native soil and the holy faith\"--and the\r\nmost exaggerated expectations were entertained of its results. The old\r\nEastern Question was at last to be solved in accordance with Russian\r\naspirations, and Nicholas was about to realise Catherine II.\u0027s grand\r\nscheme of driving the Turks out of Europe. The date at which the troops\r\nwould arrive at Constantinople was actively discussed, and a Slavophil\r\npoet called on the Emperor to lie down in Constantinople, and rise up as\r\nTsar of a Panslavonic Empire. Some enthusiasts even expected the speedy\r\nliberation of Jerusalem from the power of the Infidel. To the enemy, who\r\nmight possibly hinder the accomplishment of these schemes, very little\r\nattention was paid. \"We have only to throw our hats at them!\" (Shapkami\r\nzakidaem) became a favourite expression.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, a few men in whom the prospect of the coming\r\nstruggle awoke very different thoughts and feelings. They could not\r\nshare the sanguine expectations of those who were confident of success.\r\n\"What preparations have we made,\" they asked, \"for the struggle with\r\ncivilisation, which now sends its forces against us? With all our vast\r\nterritory and countless population we are incapable of coping with it.\r\nWhen we talk of the glorious campaign against Napoleon, we forget\r\nthat since that time Europe has been steadily advancing on the road of\r\nprogress while we have been standing still. We march not to victory,\r\nbut to defeat, and the only grain of consolation which we have is that\r\nRussia will learn by experience a lesson that will be of use to her in\r\nthe future.\"*\r\n\r\n     * These are the words of Granovski.\r\n\r\nThese prophets of evil found, of course, few disciples, and were\r\ngenerally regarded as unworthy sons of the Fatherland--almost as\r\ntraitors to their country. But their predictions were confirmed by\r\nevents. The Allies were victorious in the Crimea, and even the despised\r\nTurks made a successful stand on the line of the Danube. In spite of the\r\nefforts of the Government to suppress all unpleasant intelligence, it\r\nsoon became known that the military organisation was little, if at all,\r\nbetter than the civil administration--that the individual bravery of\r\nsoldiers and officers was neutralised by the incapacity of the generals,\r\nthe venality of the officials, and the shameless peculation of the\r\ncommissariat department. The Emperor, it was said, had drilled out of\r\nthe officers all energy, individuality, and moral force. Almost the only\r\nmen who showed judgment, decision, and energy were the officers of the\r\nBlack Sea fleet, which had been less subjected to the prevailing system.\r\nAs the struggle went on, it became evident how weak the country really\r\nwas--how deficient in the resources necessary to sustain a prolonged\r\nconflict. \"Another year of war,\" writes an eye-witness in 1855, \"and\r\nthe whole of Southern Russia will be ruined.\" To meet the extraordinary\r\ndemands on the Treasury, recourse was had to an enormous issue of paper\r\nmoney; but the rapid depreciation of the currency showed that this\r\nresource would soon be exhausted. Militia regiments were everywhere\r\nraised throughout the country, and many proprietors spent large sums in\r\nequipping volunteer corps; but very soon this enthusiasm cooled when\r\nit was found that the patriotic efforts enriched the jobbers without\r\ninflicting any serious injury on the enemy.\r\n\r\nUnder the sting of the great national humiliation, the upper classes\r\nawoke from their optimistic resignation. They had borne patiently the\r\noppression of a semi-military administration, and for this! The system\r\nof Nicholas had been put to a crucial test, and found wanting. The\r\npolicy which had sacrificed all to increase the military power of\r\nthe Empire was seen to be a fatal error, and the worthlessness of\r\nthe drill-sergeant regime was proved by bitter experience. Those\r\nadministrative fetters which had for more than a quarter of a century\r\ncramped every spontaneous movement had failed to fulfil even the narrow\r\npurpose for which they had been forged. They had, indeed, secured a\r\ncertain external tranquillity during those troublous times when Europe\r\nwas convulsed by revolutionary agitation; but this tranquillity was not\r\nthat of healthy normal action, but of death--and underneath the surface\r\nlay secret and rapidly spreading corruption. The army still possessed\r\nthat dashing gallantry which it had displayed in the campaigns of\r\nSuvorof, that dogged, stoical bravery which had checked the advance of\r\nNapoleon on the field of Borodino, and that wondrous power of endurance\r\nwhich had often redeemed the negligence of generals and the defects of\r\nthe commissariat; but the result was now not victory, but defeat. How\r\ncould this be explained except by the radical defects of that system\r\nwhich had been long practised with such inflexible perseverance? The\r\nGovernment had imagined that it could do everything by its own wisdom\r\nand energy, and in reality it had done nothing, or worse than nothing.\r\nThe higher officers had learned only too well to be mere automata; the\r\nameliorations in the military organisation, on which Nicholas had always\r\nbestowed special attention, were found to exist for the most part only\r\nin the official reports; the shameful exploits of the commissariat\r\ndepartment were such as to excite the indignation of those who had\r\nlong lived in an atmosphere of official jobbery and peculation; and\r\nthe finances, which people had generally supposed to be in a highly\r\nsatisfactory condition, had become seriously crippled by the first great\r\nnational effort.\r\n\r\nThis deep and wide-spread dissatisfaction was not allowed to appear\r\nin the Press, but it found very free expression in the manuscript\r\nliterature and in conversation. In almost every house--I mean, of\r\ncourse, among the educated classes--words were spoken which a few months\r\nbefore would have seemed treasonable, if not blasphemous. Philippics and\r\nsatires in prose and verse were written by the dozen, and circulated\r\nin hundreds of copies. A pasquil on the Commander in Chief, or a tirade\r\nagainst the Government, was sure to be eagerly read and warmly approved\r\nof. As a specimen of this kind of literature, and an illustration of the\r\npublic opinion of the time, I may translate here one of those metrical\r\ntirades. Though it was never printed, it obtained a wide circulation:\r\n\r\n\"\u0027God has placed me over Russia,\u0027 said the Tsar to us, \u0027and you must bow\r\ndown before me, for my throne is His altar. Trouble not yourselves with\r\npublic affairs, for I think for you and watch over you every hour. My\r\nwatchful eye detects internal evils and the machinations of foreign\r\nenemies; and I have no need of counsel, for God inspires me with wisdom.\r\nBe proud, therefore, of being my slaves, O Russians, and regard my will\r\nas your law.\u0027\r\n\r\n\"We listened to these words with deep reverence, and gave a tacit\r\nconsent; and what was the result? Under mountains of official papers\r\nreal interests were forgotten. The letter of the law was observed, but\r\nnegligence and crime were allowed to go unpunished. While grovelling in\r\nthe dust before ministers and directors of departments in the hope of\r\nreceiving tchins and decorations, the officials stole unblushingly;\r\nand theft became so common that he who stole the most was the most\r\nrespected. The merits of officers were decided at reviews; and he who\r\nobtained the rank of General was supposed capable of becoming at once an\r\nable governor, an excellent engineer, or a most wise senator. Those who\r\nwere appointed governors were for the most part genuine satraps, the\r\nscourges of the provinces entrusted to their care. The other offices\r\nwere filled up with as little attention to the merits of the candidates.\r\nA stable-boy became Press censor! an Imperial fool became admiral!\r\nKleinmichel became a count! In a word, the country was handed over to\r\nthe tender mercies of a band of robbers.\r\n\r\n\"And what did we Russians do all this time?\r\n\r\n\"We Russians slept! With groans the peasant paid his yearly dues; with\r\ngroans the proprietor mortgaged the second half of his estate; groaning,\r\nwe all paid our heavy tribute to the officials. Occasionally, with a\r\ngrave shaking of the head, we remarked in a whisper that it was a shame\r\nand a disgrace--that there was no justice in the courts--that millions\r\nwere squandered on Imperial tours, kiosks, and pavilions--that\r\neverything was wrong; and then, with an easy conscience, we sat down\r\nto our rubber, praised the acting of Rachel, criticised the singing of\r\nFrezzolini, bowed low to venal magnates, and squabbled with each other\r\nfor advancement in the very service which we so severely condemned.\r\nIf we did not obtain the place we wished we retired to our ancestral\r\nestates, where we talked of the crops, fattened in indolence and\r\ngluttony, and lived a genuine animal life. If any one, amidst the\r\ngeneral lethargy, suddenly called upon us to rise and fight for the\r\ntruth and for Russia, how ridiculous did he appear! How cleverly the\r\nPharisaical official ridiculed him, and how quickly the friends of\r\nyesterday showed him the cold shoulder! Under the anathema of public\r\nopinion, in some distant Siberian mine he recognised what a heinous\r\nsin it was to disturb the heavy sleep of apathetic slaves. Soon he was\r\nforgotten, or remembered as an unfortunate madman; and the few who said,\r\n\u0027Perhaps after all he was right,\u0027 hastened to add, \u0027but that is none of\r\nour business.\u0027\r\n\r\n\"But amidst all this we had at least one consolation, one thing to be\r\nproud of--the might of Russia in the assembly of kings. \u0027What need we\r\ncare,\u0027 we said, \u0027for the reproaches of foreign nations? We are stronger\r\nthan those who reproach us.\u0027 And when at great reviews the stately\r\nregiments marched past with waving standards, glittering helmets, and\r\nsparkling bayonets, when we heard the loud hurrah with which the troops\r\ngreeted the Emperor, then our hearts swelled with patriotic pride, and\r\nwe were ready to repeat the words of the poet--\r\n\r\n\"Strong is our native country, and great the Russian Tsar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then British statesmen, in company with the crowned conspirator of\r\nFrance, and with treacherous Austria, raised Western Europe against us,\r\nbut we laughed scornfully at the coming storm. \u0027Let the nations rave,\u0027\r\nwe said; \u0027we have no cause to be afraid. The Tsar doubtless foresaw\r\nall, and has long since made the necessary preparations.\u0027 Boldly we went\r\nforth to fight, and confidently awaited the moment of the struggle.\r\n\r\n\"And lo! after all our boasting we were taken by surprise, and caught\r\nunawares, as by a robber in the dark. The sleep of innate stupidity\r\nblinded our Ambassadors, and our Foreign Minister sold us to\r\nour enemies.* Where were our millions of soldiers? Where was the\r\nwell-considered plan of defence? One courier brought the order to\r\nadvance; another brought the order to retreat; and the army wandered\r\nabout without definite aim or purpose. With loss and shame we retreated\r\nfrom the forts of Silistria, and the pride of Russia was humbled before\r\nthe Hapsburg eagle. The soldiers fought well, but the parade-admiral\r\n(Menshikof)--the amphibious hero of lost battles--did not know\r\nthe geography of his own country, and sent his troops to certain\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n     * Many people at that time imagined that Count Nesselrode,\r\n     who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs, was a traitor to\r\n     his adopted country.\r\n\r\n\"Awake, O Russia! Devoured by foreign enemies, crushed by slavery,\r\nshamefully oppressed by stupid authorities and spies, awaken from your\r\nlong sleep of ignorance and apathy! You have been long enough held\r\nin bondage by the successors of the Tartar Khan. Stand forward calmly\r\nbefore the throne of the despot, and demand from him an account of the\r\nnational disaster. Say to him boldly that his throne is not the altar of\r\nGod, and that God did not condemn us to be slaves. Russia entrusted to\r\nyou, O Tsar, the supreme power, and you were as a God upon earth. And\r\nwhat have you done? Blinded by ignorance and passion, you have lusted\r\nafter power and have forgotten Russia. You have spent your life in\r\nreviewing troops, in modifying uniforms, and in appending your signature\r\nto the legislative projects of ignorant charlatans. You created the\r\ndespicable race of Press censors, in order to sleep in peace--in order\r\nnot to know the wants and not to hear the groans of the people--in order\r\nnot to listen to Truth. You buried Truth, rolled a great stone to the\r\ndoor of the sepulchre, placed a strong guard over it, and said in the\r\npride of your heart: For her there is no resurrection! But the third day\r\nhas dawned, and Truth has arisen from the dead.\r\n\r\n\"Stand forward, O Tsar, before the judgment-seat of history and of God!\r\nYou have mercilessly trampled Truth under foot, you have denied\r\nFreedom, you have been the slave of your own passions. By your pride and\r\nobstinacy you have exhausted Russia and raised the world in arms against\r\nus. Bow down before your brethren and humble yourself in the dust! Crave\r\npardon and ask advice! Throw yourself into the arms of the people! There\r\nis now no other salvation!\"\r\n\r\nThe innumerable tirades of which the above is a fair specimen were not\r\nvery remarkable for literary merit or political wisdom. For the most\r\npart they were simply bits of bombastic rhetoric couched in doggerel\r\nrhyme, and they have consequently been long since consigned to\r\nwell-merited oblivion--so completely that it is now difficult to obtain\r\ncopies of them.* They have, however, an historical interest, because\r\nthey express in a more or less exaggerated form the public opinion and\r\nprevalent ideas of the educated classes at that moment. In order to\r\ncomprehend their real significance, we must remember that the writers\r\nand readers were not a band of conspirators, but ordinary, respectable,\r\nwell-intentioned people, who never for a moment dreamed of embarking\r\nin revolutionary designs. It was the same society that had been a few\r\nmonths before so indifferent to all political questions, and even now\r\nthere was no clear conception as to how the loud-sounding phrases could\r\nbe translated into action. We can imagine the comical discomfiture of\r\nthose who read and listened to these appeals, if the \"despot\" had obeyed\r\ntheir summons, and suddenly appeared before them.\r\n\r\n     * I am indebted for the copies which I possess to friends\r\n     who copied and collected these pamphlets at the time.\r\n\r\nWas the movement, then, merely an outburst of childish petulance?\r\nCertainly not. The public were really and seriously convinced that\r\nthings were all wrong, and they were seriously and enthusiastically\r\ndesirous that a new and better order of things should be introduced. It\r\nmust be said to their honour that they did not content themselves with\r\naccusing and lampooning the individuals who were supposed to be the\r\nchief culprits. On the contrary, they looked reality boldly in the face,\r\nmade a public confession of their past sins, sought conscientiously the\r\ncauses which had produced the recent disasters, and endeavoured to find\r\nmeans by which such calamities might be prevented in the future. The\r\npublic feeling and aspirations were not strong enough to conquer the\r\ntraditional respect for the Imperial will and create an open opposition\r\nto the Autocratic Power, but they were strong enough to do great things\r\nby aiding the Government, if the Emperor voluntarily undertook a series\r\nof radical reforms.\r\n\r\nWhat Nicholas would have done, had he lived, in face of this national\r\nawakening, it is difficult to say. He declared, indeed, that he could\r\nnot change, and we can readily believe that his proud spirit would\r\nhave scorned to make concessions to the principles which he had always\r\ncondemned; but he gave decided indications in the last days of his life\r\nthat his old faith in his system was somewhat shaken, and he did not\r\nexhort his son to persevere in the path along which he himself had\r\nforced his way with such obstinate consistency. It is useless, however,\r\nto speculate on possibilities. Whilst the Government had still to\r\nconcentrate all its energies on the defence of the country, the Iron\r\nTsar died, and was succeeded by his son, a man of a very different type.\r\n\r\nOf a kind-hearted, humane disposition, sincerely desirous of maintaining\r\nthe national honour, but singularly free from military ambition\r\nand imbued with no fanatical belief in the drill-sergeant system of\r\ngovernment, Alexander II. was by no means insensible to the spirit\r\nof the time. He had, however, none of the sentimental enthusiasm for\r\nliberal institutions which had characterised his uncle, Alexander I.\r\nOn the contrary, he had inherited from his father a strong dislike to\r\nsentimentalism and rhetoric of all kinds. This dislike, joined to a\r\ngoodly portion of sober common-sense, a limited confidence in his own\r\njudgment, and a consciousness of enormous responsibility, prevented him\r\nfrom being carried away by the prevailing excitement. With all that was\r\ngenerous and humane in the movement he thoroughly sympathised, and he\r\nallowed the popular ideas and aspirations to find free utterance; but\r\nhe did not at once commit himself to any definite policy, and carefully\r\nrefrained from all exaggerated expressions of reforming zeal.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as peace had been concluded, there were unmistakable\r\nsymptoms that the rigorously repressive system of Nicholas was about to\r\nbe abandoned. In the manifesto announcing the termination of hostilities\r\nthe Emperor expressed his conviction that by the combined efforts of the\r\nGovernment and the people, the public administration would be improved,\r\nand that justice and mercy would reign in the courts of law. Apparently\r\nas a preparation for this great work, to be undertaken by the Tsar and\r\nhis people in common, the ministers began to take the public into their\r\nconfidence, and submitted to public criticism many official data\r\nwhich had hitherto been regarded as State secrets. The Minister of the\r\nInterior, for instance, in his annual report, spoke almost in the tone\r\nof a penitent, and confessed openly that the morality of the officials\r\nunder his orders left much to be desired. He declared that the Emperor\r\nnow showed a paternal confidence in his people, and as a proof of this\r\nhe mentioned the significant fact that 9,000 persons had been liberated\r\nfrom police supervision. The other branches of the Administration\r\nunderwent a similar transformation. The haughty, dictatorial tone which\r\nhad hitherto been used by superiors to their subordinates, and by all\r\nranks of officials to the public, was replaced by one of considerate\r\npoliteness. About the same time those of the Decembrists who were still\r\nalive were pardoned. The restrictions regarding the number of students\r\nin each university were abolished, the difficulty of obtaining\r\nforeign passports was removed, and the Press censors became singularly\r\nindulgent. Though no decided change had been made in the laws, it was\r\nuniversally felt that the spirit of Nicholas was no more.\r\n\r\nThe public, anxiously seeking after a sign, readily took these symptoms\r\nof change as a complete confirmation of their ardent hopes, and leaped\r\nat once to the conclusion that a vast, all-embracing system of radical\r\nreform was about to be undertaken--not secretly by the Administration,\r\nas had been the custom in the preceding reign when any little changes\r\nhad to be made, but publicly, by the Government and the people in\r\ncommon. \"The heart trembles with joy,\" said one of the leading organs of\r\nthe Press, \"in expectation of the great social reforms that are about to\r\nbe effected--reforms that are thoroughly in accordance with the spirit,\r\nthe wishes, and the expectations of the public.\" \"The old harmony and\r\ncommunity of feeling,\" said another, \"which has always existed between\r\nthe government and the people, save during short exceptional periods,\r\nhas been fully re-established. The absence of all sentiment of caste,\r\nand the feeling of common origin and brotherhood which binds all classes\r\nof the Russian people into a homogeneous whole, will enable Russia to\r\naccomplish peacefully and without effort not only those great reforms\r\nwhich cost Europe centuries of struggle and bloodshed, but also many\r\nwhich the nations of the West are still unable to accomplish, in\r\nconsequence of feudal traditions and caste prejudices.\" The past was\r\ndepicted in the blackest colours, and the nation was called upon to\r\nbegin a new and glorious epoch of its history. \"We have to struggle,\" it\r\nwas said, \"in the name of the highest truth against egotism and the puny\r\ninterests of the moment; and we ought to prepare our children from their\r\ninfancy to take part in that struggle which awaits every honest man.\r\nWe have to thank the war for opening our eyes to the dark sides of our\r\npolitical and social organisation, and it is now our duty to profit\r\nby the lesson. But it must not be supposed that the Government can,\r\nsingle-handed, remedy the defects. The destinies of Russia are, as it\r\nwere, a stranded vessel which the captain and crew cannot move, and\r\nwhich nothing, indeed, but the rising tide of the national life can\r\nraise and float.\"\r\n\r\nHearts beat quicker at the sound of these calls to action. Many heard\r\nthis new teaching, if we may believe a contemporary authority, \"with\r\ntears in their eyes\"; then, \"raising boldly their heads, they made a\r\nsolemn vow that they would act honourably, perseveringly, fearlessly.\"\r\nSome of those who had formerly yielded to the force of circumstances\r\nnow confessed their misdemeanours with bitterness of heart. \"Tears\r\nof repentance,\" said a popular poet, \"give relief, and call us to new\r\nexploits.\" Russia was compared to a strong giant who awakes from sleep,\r\nstretches his brawny limbs, collects his thoughts, and prepares to atone\r\nfor his long inactivity by feats of untold prowess. All believed, or at\r\nleast assumed, that the recognition of defects would necessarily entail\r\ntheir removal. When an actor in one of the St. Petersburg theatres\r\nshouted from the stage, \"Let us proclaim throughout all Russia that the\r\ntime has come for tearing up evil by the roots!\" the audience gave way\r\nto the most frantic enthusiasm. \"Altogether a joyful time,\" says one who\r\ntook part in the excitement, \"as when, after the long winter, the genial\r\nbreath of spring glides over the cold, petrified earth, and nature\r\nawakens from her deathlike sleep. Speech, long restrained by police and\r\ncensorial regulations, now flows smoothly, majestically, like a mighty\r\nriver that has just been freed from ice.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these influences a multitude of newspapers and periodicals were\r\nfounded, and the current literature entirely changed its character. The\r\npurely literary and historical questions which had hitherto engaged the\r\nattention of the reading public were thrown aside and forgotten, unless\r\nthey could be made to illustrate some principle of political or social\r\nscience. Criticisms on style and diction, explanations of aesthetic\r\nprinciples, metaphysical discussions--all this seemed miserable trifling\r\nto men who wished to devote themselves to gigantic practical interests.\r\n\"Science,\" it was said, \"has now descended from the heights of\r\nphilosophic abstraction into the arena of real life.\" The periodicals\r\nwere accordingly filled with articles on railways, banks, free-trade,\r\neducation, agriculture, communal institutions, local self-government,\r\njoint-stock companies, and with crushing philippics against personal\r\nand national vanity, inordinate luxury, administrative tyranny, and the\r\nhabitual peculation of the officials. This last-named subject received\r\nspecial attention. During the preceding reign any attempt to criticise\r\npublicly the character or acts of an official was regarded as a very\r\nheinous offence; now there was a deluge of sketches, tales, comedies,\r\nand monologues, describing the corruption of the Administration, and\r\nexplaining the ingenious devices by which the tchinovniks increased\r\ntheir scanty salaries. The public would read nothing that had not a\r\ndirect or indirect bearing on the questions of the day, and whatever had\r\nsuch a bearing was read with interest. It did not seem at all strange\r\nthat a drama should be written in defence of free-trade, or a poem\r\nin advocacy of some peculiar mode of taxation; that an author should\r\nexpound his political ideas in a tale, and his antagonist reply by\r\na comedy. A few men of the old school protested feebly against this\r\n\"prostitution of art,\" but they received little attention, and the\r\ndoctrine that art should be cultivated for its own sake was scouted as\r\nan invention of aristocratic indolence. Here is an ipsa pinxit of the\r\nliterature of the time: \"Literature has come to look at Russia with her\r\nown eyes, and sees that the idyllic romantic personages which the poets\r\nformerly loved to describe have no objective existence. Having taken\r\noff her French glove, she offers her hand to the rude, hard-working\r\nlabourer, and observing lovingly Russian village life, she feels herself\r\nin her native land. The writers of the present have analysed the past,\r\nand, having separated themselves from aristocratic litterateurs and\r\naristocratic society, have demolished their former idols.\"\r\n\r\nBy far the most influential periodical at the commencement of the\r\nmovement was the Kolokol, or Bell, a fortnightly journal published in\r\nLondon by Herzen, who was at that time an important personage among\r\nthe political refugees. Herzen was a man of education and culture, with\r\nultra-radical opinions, and not averse to using revolutionary methods\r\nof reform when he considered them necessary. His intimate relations\r\nwith many of the leading men in Russia enabled him to obtain secret\r\ninformation of the most important and varied kind, and his sparkling\r\nwit, biting satire, and clear, terse, brilliant style secured him a\r\nlarge number of readers. He seemed to know everything that was done in\r\nthe ministries and even in the Cabinet of the Emperor,* and he exposed\r\nmost mercilessly every abuse that came to his knowledge. We who are\r\naccustomed to free political discussion can hardly form a conception of\r\nthe avidity with which his articles were read, and the effect which they\r\nproduced. Though strictly prohibited by the Press censure, the Kolokol\r\nfound its way across the frontier in thousands of copies, and was\r\neagerly perused and commented on by all ranks of the educated classes.\r\nThe Emperor himself received it regularly, and high-priced delinquents\r\nexamined it with fear and trembling. In this way Herzen was for some\r\nyears, though an exile, an important political personage, and did much\r\nto awaken and keep up the reform enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n     * As an illustration of this, the following anecdote is\r\n     told: One number of the Kolokol contained a violent attack\r\n     on an important personage of the court, and the accused, or\r\n     some one of his friends, considered it advisable to have a\r\n     copy specially printed for the Emperor without the\r\n     objectionable article.  The Emperor did not at first\r\n     discover the trick, but shortly afterwards he received from\r\n     London a polite note containing the article which had been\r\n     omitted, and informing him how he had been deceived.\r\n\r\nBut where were the Conservatives all this time? How came it that for two\r\nor three years no voice was raised and no protest made even against\r\nthe rhetorical exaggerations of the new-born liberalism? Where were the\r\nrepresentatives of the old regime, who had been so thoroughly imbued\r\nwith the spirit of Nicholas? Where were those ministers who had\r\nsystematically extinguished the least indication of private initiative,\r\nthose \"satraps\" who had stamped out the least symptom of insubordination\r\nor discontent, those Press censors who had diligently suppressed\r\nthe mildest expression of liberal opinion, those thousands of\r\nwell-intentioned proprietors who had regarded as dangerous free-thinkers\r\nand treasonable republicans all who ventured to express dissatisfaction\r\nwith the existing state of things? A short time before, the\r\nConservatives composed at least nine-tenths of the upper classes, and\r\nnow they had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that in a country accustomed to\r\npolitical life, such a sudden, unopposed revolution in public opinion\r\ncould not possibly take place. The key to the mystery lies in the\r\nfact that for centuries Russia had known nothing of political life or\r\npolitical parties. Those who were sometimes called Conservatives were\r\nin reality not at all Conservatives in our sense of the term. If we say\r\nthat they had a certain amount of conservatism, we must add that it\r\nwas of the latent, passive, unreasoned kind--the fruit of indolence and\r\napathy. Their political creed had but one article: Thou shalt love the\r\nTsar with all thy might, and carefully abstain from all resistance\r\nto his will--especially when it happens that the Tsar is a man of the\r\nNicholas type. So long as Nicholas lived they had passively acquiesced\r\nin his system--active acquiescence had been neither demanded nor\r\ndesired--but when he died, the system of which he was the soul died with\r\nhim. What then could they seek to defend? They were told that the system\r\nwhich they had been taught to regard as the sheet-anchor of the State\r\nwas in reality the chief cause of the national disasters; and to this\r\nthey could make no reply, because they had no better explanation of\r\ntheir own to offer. They were convinced that the Russian soldier was the\r\nbest soldier in the world, and they knew that in the recent war the army\r\nhad not been victorious; the system, therefore, must be to blame. They\r\nwere told that a series of gigantic reforms was necessary in order to\r\nrestore Russia to her proper place among the nations; and to this\r\nthey could make no answer, for they had never studied such abstract\r\nquestions. And one thing they did know: that those who hesitated to\r\nadmit the necessity of gigantic reforms were branded by the Press as\r\nignorant, narrow-minded, prejudiced, and egotistical, and were held up\r\nto derision as men who did not know the most elementary principles of\r\npolitical and economic science. Freely expressed public opinion was\r\nsuch a new phenomenon in Russia that the Press was able for some time\r\nto exercise a \"Liberal\" tyranny scarcely less severe than the\r\n\"Conservative\" tyranny of the censors in the preceding reign. Men who\r\nwould have stood fire gallantly on the field of battle quailed before\r\nthe poisoned darts of Herzen in the Kolokol. Under such circumstances,\r\neven the few who possessed some vague Conservative convictions refrained\r\nfrom publicly expressing them.\r\n\r\nThe men who had played a more or less active part during the preceding\r\nreign, and who might therefore be expected to have clearer and deeper\r\nconvictions, were specially incapable of offering opposition to the\r\nprevailing Liberal enthusiasm. Their Conservatism was of quite as limp\r\na kind as that of the landed proprietors who were not in the public\r\nservice, for under Nicholas the higher a man was placed the less likely\r\nwas he to have political convictions of any kind outside the simple\r\npolitical creed above referred to. Besides this, they belonged to that\r\nclass which was for the moment under the anathema of public opinion, and\r\nthey had drawn direct personal advantage from the system which was now\r\nrecognised as the chief cause of the national disasters.\r\n\r\nFor a time the name of tchinovnik became a term of reproach and\r\nderision, and the position of those who bore it was comically painful.\r\nThey strove to prove that, though they held a post in the public\r\nservice, they were entirely free from the tchinovnik spirit--that there\r\nwas nothing of the genuine tchinovnik about them. Those who had formerly\r\nparaded their tchin (official rank) on all occasions, in season and\r\nout of season, became half ashamed to admit that they had the rank\r\nof General; for the title no longer commanded respect, and had become\r\nassociated with all that was antiquated, formal, and stupid. Among\r\nthe young generation it was used most disrespectfully as equivalent\r\nto \"pompous blockhead.\" Zealous officials who had lately regarded the\r\nacquisition of Stars and Orders as among the chief ends of man, were\r\nfain to conceal those hard-won trophies, lest some cynical \"Liberal\"\r\nmight notice them and make them the butt of his satire. \"Look at the\r\ndepth of humiliation to which you have brought the country\"--such was\r\nthe chorus of reproach that was ever ringing in their ears--\"with\r\nyour red tape, your Chinese formalism, and your principle of lifeless,\r\nunreasoning, mechanical obedience! You asserted constantly that you were\r\nthe only true patriots, and branded with the name of traitor those who\r\nwarned you of the insane folly of your conduct. You see now what it has\r\nall come to. The men whom you helped to send to the mines turn out to\r\nhave been the true patriots.\"*\r\n\r\n     * It was a common saying at that time that nearly all the\r\n     best men in Russia had spent a part of their lives in\r\n     Siberia, and it was proposed to publish a biographical\r\n     dictionary of remarkable men, in which every article was to\r\n     end thus: \"Exiled to ---- in 18--.\"  I am not aware how far\r\n     the project was seriously entertained, but, of course, the\r\n     book was never published.\r\n\r\nAnd to these reproaches what could they reply? Like a child who has in\r\nhis frolics inadvertently set the house on fire, they could only look\r\ncontrite, and say they did not mean it. They had simply accepted without\r\ncriticism the existing order of things, and ranged themselves among\r\nthose who were officially recognised as \"the well-intentioned.\" If they\r\nhad always avoided the Liberals, and perhaps helped to persecute them,\r\nit was simply because all \"well-intentioned\" people said that Liberals\r\nwere \"restless\" and dangerous to the State. Those who were not convinced\r\nof their errors simply kept silence, but the great majority passed over\r\nto the ranks of the Progressists, and many endeavoured to redeem their\r\npast by showing extreme zeal for the Liberal cause.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this extraordinary outburst of reform enthusiasm, we\r\nmust further remember that the Russian educated classes, in spite of the\r\nsevere northern climate which is supposed to make the blood circulate\r\nslowly, are extremely impulsive. They are fettered by no venerable\r\nhistorical prejudices, and are wonderfully sensitive to the seductive\r\ninfluence of grandiose projects, especially when these excite the\r\npatriotic feelings. Then there was the simple force of reaction--the\r\nrebound which naturally followed the terrific compression of the\r\npreceding reign. Without disrespect, the Russians of that time may\r\nbe compared to schoolboys who have just escaped from the rigorous\r\ndiscipline of a severe schoolmaster. In the first moments of freedom it\r\nwas supposed that there would be no more discipline or compulsion. The\r\nutmost respect was to be shown to \"human dignity,\" and every Russian\r\nwas to act spontaneously and zealously at the great work of national\r\nregeneration. All thirsted for reforming activity. The men in authority\r\nwere inundated with projects of reform--some of them anonymous, and\r\nothers from obscure individuals; some of them practical, and very many\r\nwildly fantastic. Even the grammarians showed their sympathy with the\r\nspirit of the time by proposing to expel summarily all redundant letters\r\nfrom the Russian alphabet!\r\n\r\nThe fact that very few people had clear, precise ideas as to what was\r\nto be done did not prevent, but rather tended to increase, the reform\r\nenthusiasm. All had at least one common feeling--dislike to what had\r\npreviously existed. It was only when it became necessary to forsake pure\r\nnegation, and to create something, that the conceptions became clearer,\r\nand a variety of opinions appeared. At the first moment there was\r\nmerely unanimity in negation, and an impulsive enthusiasm for beneficent\r\nreforms in general.\r\n\r\nThe first specific proposals were direct deductions from the lessons\r\ntaught by the war. The war had shown in a terrible way the disastrous\r\nconsequences of having merely primitive means of communication; the\r\nPress and the public began, accordingly, to speak about the necessity of\r\nconstructing railways, roads and river-steamers. The war had shown\r\nthat a country which has not developed its natural resources very soon\r\nbecomes exhausted if it has to make a great national effort; accordingly\r\nthe public and the Press talked about the necessity of developing the\r\nnatural resources, and about the means by which this desirable end might\r\nbe attained. It had been shown by the war that a system of education\r\nwhich tends to make men mere apathetic automata cannot produce even a\r\ngood army; accordingly the public and the Press began to discuss the\r\ndifferent systems of education and the numerous questions of pedagogical\r\nscience. It had been shown by the war that the best intentions of\r\na Government will necessarily be frustrated if the majority of the\r\nofficials are dishonest or incapable; accordingly the public and the\r\nPress began to speak about the paramount necessity of reforming the\r\nAdministration in all its branches.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that in thus laying to heart the\r\nlessons taught by the war and endeavouring to profit by them, the\r\nRussians were actuated by warlike feelings, and desired to avenge\r\nthemselves as soon as possible on their victorious enemies. On the\r\ncontrary, the whole movement and the spirit which animated it were\r\neminently pacific. Prince Gortchakof\u0027s saying, \"La Russie ne boude pas,\r\nelle se recueille,\" was more than a diplomatic repartee--it was a\r\ntrue and graphic statement of the case. Though the Russians are very\r\ninflammable, and can be very violent when their patriotic feelings are\r\naroused, they are, individually and as a nation, singularly free from\r\nrancour and the spirit of revenge. After the termination of hostilities\r\nthey really bore little malice towards the Western Powers, except\r\ntowards Austria, which was believed to have been treacherous and\r\nungrateful to the country that had saved her in 1849. Their patriotism\r\nnow took the form, not of revenge, but of a desire to raise their\r\ncountry to the level of the Western nations. If they thought of military\r\nmatters at all, they assumed that military power would be obtained as a\r\nnatural and inevitable result of high civilisation and good government.\r\n\r\nAs a first step towards the realisation of the vast schemes\r\ncontemplated, voluntary associations began to be formed for industrial\r\nand commercial purposes, and a law was issued for the creation of\r\nlimited liability companies. In the space of two years forty-seven\r\ncompanies of this kind were founded, with a combined capital of 358\r\nmillions of roubles. To understand the full significance of these\r\nfigures, we must know that from the founding of the first joint-stock\r\ncompany in 1799 down to 1853 only twenty-six companies had been formed,\r\nand their united capital amounted only to thirty-two millions of\r\nroubles. Thus in the space of two years (1857-58) eleven times as much\r\ncapital was subscribed to joint-stock companies as had been subscribed\r\nduring half a century previous to the war. The most exaggerated\r\nexpectations were entertained as to the national and private advantages\r\nwhich must necessarily result from these undertakings, and it became\r\na patriotic duty to subscribe liberally. The periodical literature\r\ndepicted in glowing terms the marvellous results that had been obtained\r\nin other countries by the principle of co-operation, and sanguine\r\nreaders believed that they had discovered a patriotic way of speedily\r\nbecoming rich.\r\n\r\nThese were, however, mere secondary matters, and the public were\r\nanxiously waiting for the Government to begin the grand reforming\r\ncampaign. When the educated classes awoke to the necessity of great\r\nreforms, there was no clear conception as to how the great work should\r\nbe undertaken. There was so much to be done that it was no easy matter\r\nto decide what should be done first. Administrative, judicial, social,\r\neconomical, financial, and political reforms seemed all equally\r\npressing. Gradually, however, it became evident that precedence must be\r\ngiven to the question of serfage. It was absurd to speak about progress,\r\nhumanitarianism, education, self-government, equality in the eye of\r\nthe law, and similar matters, so long as one half of the population was\r\nexcluded from the enjoyment of ordinary civil rights. So long as serfage\r\nexisted it was mere mockery to talk about re-organising Russia according\r\nto the latest results of political and social science. How could a\r\nsystem of even-handed justice be introduced when twenty millions of the\r\npeasantry were subject to the arbitrary will of the landed proprietors?\r\nHow could agricultural or industrial progress be made without free\r\nlabour? How could the Government take active measures for the spread of\r\nnational education when it had no direct control over one-half of\r\nthe peasantry? Above all, how could it be hoped that a great moral\r\nregeneration could take place, so long as the nation voluntarily\r\nretained the stigma of serfage and slavery?\r\n\r\nAll this was very generally felt by the educated classes, but no one\r\nventured to raise the question until it should be known what were the\r\nviews of the Emperor on the subject. How the question was gradually\r\nraised, how it was treated by the nobles, and how it was ultimately\r\nsolved by the famous law of February 19th (March 3d), 1861,* I now\r\npropose to relate.\r\n\r\n     * February 19th according to the old style, which is still\r\n     used in Russia, and March 3d according to our method of\r\n     reckoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SERFS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rural Population in Ancient Times--The Peasantry in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury--How Was This Change Effected?--The Common Explanation\r\nInaccurate--Serfage the Result of Permanent Economic and Political\r\nCauses--Origin of the Adscriptio Glebae--Its Consequences--Serf\r\nInsurrection--Turning-point in the History of Serfage--Serfage in\r\nRussia and in Western Europe--State Peasants--Numbers and Geographical\r\nDistribution of the Serf Population--Serf Dues--Legal and Actual Power\r\nof the Proprietors--The Serfs\u0027 Means of Defence--Fugitives--Domestic\r\nSerfs--Strange Advertisements in the Moscow Gazette--Moral Influence of\r\nSerfage.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the Emancipation, it may be well to\r\nexplain briefly how the Russian peasants became serfs, and what serfage\r\nin Russia really was.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest period of Russian history the rural population was\r\ncomposed of three distinct classes. At the bottom of the scale stood the\r\nslaves, who were very numerous. Their numbers were continually augmented\r\nby prisoners of war, by freemen who voluntarily sold themselves as\r\nslaves, by insolvent debtors, and by certain categories of criminals.\r\nImmediately above the slaves were the free agricultural labourers, who\r\nhad no permanent domicile, but wandered about the country and\r\nsettled temporarily where they happened to find work and satisfactory\r\nremuneration. In the third place, distinct from these two classes, and\r\nin some respects higher in the social scale, were the peasants properly\r\nso called.*\r\n\r\n     * My chief authority for the early history of the peasantry\r\n     has been Belaef, \"Krestyanye na Rusi,\" Moscow, 1860; a most\r\n     able and conscientious work.\r\n\r\nThese peasants proper, who may be roughly described as small farmers or\r\ncottiers, were distinguished from the free agricultural labourers in two\r\nrespects: they were possessors of land in property or usufruct, and\r\nthey were members of a rural Commune. The Communes were free primitive\r\ncorporations which elected their office-bearers from among the heads\r\nof families, and sent delegates to act as judges or assessors in the\r\nPrince\u0027s Court. Some of the Communes possessed land of their own, whilst\r\nothers were settled on the estates of the landed proprietors or on the\r\nextensive domains of the monasteries. In the latter case the peasant\r\npaid a fixed yearly rent in money, in produce, or in labour, according\r\nto the terms of his contract with the proprietor or the monastery; but\r\nhe did not thereby sacrifice in any way his personal liberty. As soon\r\nas he had fulfilled the engagements stipulated in the contract and had\r\nsettled accounts with the owner of the land, he was free to change his\r\ndomicile as he pleased.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now from these early times to the eighteenth century, we find\r\nthat the position of the rural population has entirely changed in the\r\ninterval. The distinction between slaves, agricultural labourers, and\r\npeasants has completely disappeared. All three categories have melted\r\ntogether into a common class, called serfs, who are regarded as the\r\nproperty of the landed proprietors or of the State. \"The proprietors\r\nsell their peasants and domestic servants not even in families, but one\r\nby one, like cattle, as is done nowhere else in the whole world, from\r\nwhich practice there is not a little wailing.\"* And yet the Government,\r\nwhilst professing to regret the existence of the practice, takes no\r\nenergetic measures to prevent it. On the contrary, it deprives the serfs\r\nof all legal protection, and expressly commands that if any serf shall\r\ndare to present a petition against his master, he shall be punished with\r\nthe knout and transported for life to the mines of Nertchinsk. (Ukaz of\r\nAugust 22d, 1767.**)\r\n\r\n     * These words are taken from an Imperial ukaz of April 15th,\r\n     1721. Polnoye Sobranye Zakonov, No. 3,770.\r\n\r\n     ** This is an ukaz of the liberal and tolerant Catherine!\r\n     How she reconciled it with her respect and admiration for\r\n     Beccaria\u0027s humane views on criminal law she does not\r\n     explain.\r\n\r\nHow did this important change take place, and how is it to be explained?\r\n\r\nIf we ask any educated Russian who has never specially occupied himself\r\nwith historical investigations regarding the origin of serfage in\r\nRussia, he will probably reply somewhat in this fashion:\r\n\r\n\"In Russia slavery has never existed (!), and even serfage in the\r\nWest-European sense has never been recognised by law! In ancient times\r\nthe rural population was completely free, and every peasant might change\r\nhis domicile on St. George\u0027s Day--that is to say, at the end of the\r\nagricultural year. This right of migration was abolished by Tsar\r\nBoris Godunof--who, by the way, was half a Tartar and more than half a\r\nusurper--and herein lies the essence of serfage in the Russian sense.\r\nThe peasants have never been the property of the landed proprietors,\r\nbut have always been personally free; and the only legal restriction on\r\ntheir liberty was that they were not allowed to change their domicile\r\nwithout the permission of the proprietor. If so-called serfs were\r\nsometimes sold, the practice was simply an abuse not justified by\r\nlegislation.\"\r\n\r\nThis simple explanation, in which may be detected a note of patriotic\r\npride, is almost universally accepted in Russia; but it contains, like\r\nmost popular conceptions of the distant past, a curious mixture of fact\r\nand fiction. Serious historical investigation tends to show that the\r\npower of the proprietors over the peasants came into existence, not\r\nsuddenly, as the result of an ukaz, but gradually, as a consequence of\r\npermanent economic and political causes, and that Boris Godunof was not\r\nmore to blame than many of his predecessors and successors.*\r\n\r\n     * See especially Pobedonostsef, in the Russki Vestnik, 1858,\r\n     No. 11, and \"Istoritcheskiya izsledovaniya i statyi\" (St.\r\n     Petersburg, 1876), by the same author; also Pogodin, in the\r\n     Russkaya Beseda, 1858, No. 4.\r\n\r\nAlthough the peasants in ancient Russia were free to wander about as\r\nthey chose, there appeared at a very early period--long before the reign\r\nof Boris Godunof--a decided tendency in the Princes, in the proprietors,\r\nand in the Communes, to prevent migration. This tendency will be easily\r\nunderstood if we remember that land without labourers is useless, and\r\nthat in Russia at that time the population was small in comparison with\r\nthe amount of reclaimed and easily reclaimable land. The Prince desired\r\nto have as many inhabitants as possible in his principality, because the\r\namount of his regular revenues depended on the number of the population.\r\nThe landed proprietor desired to have as many peasants as possible on\r\nhis estate, to till for him the land which he reserved for his own use,\r\nand to pay him for the remainder a yearly rent in money, produce, or\r\nlabour. The free Communes desired to have a number of members sufficient\r\nto keep the whole of the Communal land under cultivation, because\r\neach Commune had to pay yearly to the Prince a fixed sum in money or\r\nagricultural produce, and the greater the number of able-bodied members,\r\nthe less each individual had to pay. To use the language of political\r\neconomy, the Princes, the landed proprietors, and the free Communes\r\nall appeared as buyers in the labour market; and the demand was far in\r\nexcess of the supply. Nowadays when young colonies or landed proprietors\r\nin an outlying corner of the world are similarly in need of labour,\r\nthey seek to supply the want by organising a regular system of importing\r\nlabourers--using illegal violent means, such as kidnapping expeditions,\r\nmerely as an exceptional expedient. In old Russia any such regularly\r\norganised system was impossible, and consequently illegal or violent\r\nmeasures were not the exception, but the rule. The chief practical\r\nadvantage of the frequent military expeditions for those who took part\r\nin them was the acquisition of prisoners of war, who were commonly\r\ntransformed into slaves by their captors. If it be true, as some assert,\r\nthat only unbaptised prisoners were legally considered lawful booty,\r\nit is certain that in practice, before the unification of the\r\nprincipalities under the Tsars of Moscow, little distinction was made\r\nin this respect between unbaptised foreigners and Orthodox Russians.*\r\nA similar method was sometimes employed for the acquisition of\r\nfree peasants: the more powerful proprietors organised kidnapping\r\nexpeditions, and carried off by force the peasants settled on the land\r\nof their weaker neighbours.\r\n\r\n     * On this subject see Tchitcherin, \"Opyty po istorii\r\n     Russkago prava,\" Moscow, 1858, p. 162 et seq.; and\r\n     Lokhvitski, \"O plennykh po drevnemu Russkomu pravu,\" Moscow,\r\n     1855.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was only natural that those who possessed\r\nthis valuable commodity should do all in their power to keep it. Many,\r\nif not all, of the free Communes adopted the simple measure of refusing\r\nto allow a member to depart until he had found some one to take his\r\nplace. The proprietors never, so far as we know, laid down formally such\r\na principle, but in practice they did all in their power to retain the\r\npeasants actually settled on their estates. For this purpose some simply\r\nemployed force, whilst others acted under cover of legal formalities.\r\nThe peasant who accepted land from a proprietor rarely brought with\r\nhim the necessary implements, cattle, and capital to begin at once\r\nhis occupations, and to feed himself and his family till the ensuing\r\nharvest. He was obliged, therefore, to borrow from his landlord, and the\r\ndebt thus contracted was easily converted into a means of preventing his\r\ndeparture if he wished to change his domicile. We need not enter into\r\nfurther details. The proprietors were the capitalists of the time.\r\nFrequent bad harvests, plagues, fires, military raids, and similar\r\nmisfortunes often reduced even prosperous peasants to beggary. The\r\nmuzhik was probably then, as now, only too ready to accept a loan\r\nwithout taking the necessary precautions for repaying it. The laws\r\nrelating to debt were terribly severe, and there was no powerful\r\njudicial organisation to protect the weak. If we remember all this,\r\nwe shall not be surprised to learn that a considerable part of the\r\npeasantry were practically serfs before serfage was recognised by law.\r\n\r\nSo long as the country was broken up into independent principalities,\r\nand each land-owner was almost an independent Prince on his estate, the\r\npeasants easily found a remedy for these abuses in flight. They fled\r\nto a neighbouring proprietor who could protect them from their\r\nformer landlord and his claims, or they took refuge in a neighbouring\r\nprincipality, where they were, of course, still safer. All this was\r\nchanged when the independent principalities were transformed into the\r\nTsardom of Muscovy. The Tsars had new reasons for opposing the migration\r\nof the peasants and new means for preventing it. The old Princes had\r\nsimply given grants of land to those who served them, and left the\r\ngrantee to do with his land what seemed good to him; the Tsars, on the\r\ncontrary, gave to those who served them merely the usufruct of a certain\r\nquantity of land, and carefully proportioned the quantity to the rank\r\nand the obligations of the receiver. In this change there was plainly\r\na new reason for fixing the peasants to the soil. The real value of a\r\ngrant depended not so much on the amount of land as on the number of\r\npeasants settled on it, and hence any migration of the population was\r\ntantamount to a removal of the ancient landmarks--that is to say, to a\r\ndisturbance of the arrangements made by the Tsar. Suppose, for instance,\r\nthat the Tsar granted to a Boyar or some lesser dignitary an estate on\r\nwhich were settled twenty peasant families, and that afterwards ten of\r\nthese emigrated to neighbouring proprietors. In this case the recipient\r\nmight justly complain that he had lost half of his estate--though the\r\namount of land was in no way diminished--and that he was consequently\r\nunable to fulfil his obligations. Such complaints would be rarely,\r\nif ever, made by the great dignitaries, for they had the means of\r\nattracting peasants to their estates;* but the small proprietors\r\nhad good reason to complain, and the Tsar was bound to remove their\r\ngrievances. The attaching of the peasants to the soil was, in fact, the\r\nnatural consequence of feudal tenures--an integral part of the Muscovite\r\npolitical system. The Tsar compelled the nobles to serve him, and was\r\nunable to pay them in money. He was obliged, therefore, to procure for\r\nthem some other means of livelihood. Evidently the simplest method of\r\nsolving the difficulty was to give them land, with a certain number of\r\nlabourers, and to prevent the labourers from migrating.\r\n\r\n     * There are plain indications in the documents of the time\r\n     that the great dignitaries were at first hostile to the\r\n     adscriptio glebae. We find a similar phenomenon at a much\r\n     more recent date in Little Russia.  Long after serfage had\r\n     been legalised in that region by Catherine II., the great\r\n     proprietors, such as Rumyantsef, Razumofski, Bezborodko,\r\n     continued to attract to their estates the peasants of the\r\n     smaller proprietors.  See the article of Pogodin in the\r\n     Russkaya Beseda, 1858, No. 4, p. 154.\r\n\r\nTowards the free Communes the Tsar had to act in the same way for\r\nsimilar reasons. The Communes, like the nobles, had obligations to the\r\nSovereign, and could not fulfil them if the peasants were allowed to\r\nmigrate from one locality to another. They were, in a certain sense, the\r\nproperty of the Tsar, and it was only natural that the Tsar should do\r\nfor himself what he had done for his nobles.\r\n\r\nWith these new reasons for fixing the peasants to the soil came, as has\r\nbeen said, new means of preventing migration. Formerly it was an\r\neasy matter to flee to a neighbouring principality, but now all the\r\nprincipalities were combined under one ruler, and the foundations of a\r\ncentralised administration were laid. Severe fugitive laws were issued\r\nagainst those who attempted to change their domicile and against the\r\nproprietors who should harbour the runaways. Unless the peasant chose\r\nto face the difficulties of \"squatting\" in the inhospitable northern\r\nforests, or resolved to brave the dangers of the steppe, he could\r\nnowhere escape the heavy hand of Moscow.*\r\n\r\n     * The above account of the origin of serfage in Russia is\r\n     founded on a careful examination of the evidence which we\r\n     possess on the subject, but I must not conceal the fact that\r\n     some of the statements are founded on inference rather than\r\n     on direct, unequivocal documentary evidence.  The whole\r\n     question is one of great difficulty, and will in all\r\n     probability not be satisfactorily solved until a large\r\n     number of the old local Land-Registers (Pistsoviya Knigi)\r\n     have been published and carefully studied.\r\n\r\nThe indirect consequences of thus attaching the peasants to the soil did\r\nnot at once become apparent. The serf retained all the civil rights he\r\nhad hitherto enjoyed, except that of changing his domicile. He could\r\nstill appear before the courts of law as a free man, freely engage in\r\ntrade or industry, enter into all manner of contracts, and rent land for\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nBut as time wore on, the change in the legal relation between the two\r\nclasses became apparent in real life. In attaching the peasantry to the\r\nsoil, the Government had been so thoroughly engrossed with the direct\r\nfinancial aim that it entirely overlooked, or wilfully shut its eyes to,\r\nthe ulterior consequences which must necessarily flow from the policy it\r\nadopted. It was evident that as soon as the relation between proprietor\r\nand peasant was removed from the region of voluntary contract by being\r\nrendered indissoluble, the weaker of the two parties legally tied\r\ntogether must fall completely under the power of the stronger, unless\r\nenergetically protected by the law and the Administration. To this\r\ninevitable consequence the Government paid no attention. So far from\r\nendeavouring to protect the peasantry from the oppression of the\r\nproprietors, it did not even determine by law the mutual obligations\r\nwhich ought to exist between the two classes. Taking advantage of this\r\nomission, the proprietors soon began to impose whatever obligations they\r\nthought fit; and as they had no legal means of enforcing fulfilment,\r\nthey gradually introduced a patriarchal jurisdiction similar to\r\nthat which they exercised over their slaves, with fines and corporal\r\npunishment as means of coercion. From this they ere long proceeded a\r\nstep further, and began to sell their peasants without the land on\r\nwhich they were settled. At first this was merely a flagrant abuse\r\nunsanctioned by law, for the peasant had never been declared the private\r\nproperty of the landed proprietor; but the Government tacitly sanctioned\r\nthe practice, and even exacted dues on such sales, as on the sale of\r\nslaves. Finally the right to sell peasants without land was formally\r\nrecognised by various Imperial ukazes.*\r\n\r\n     * For instance, the ukazes of October 13th, 1675, and June\r\n     25th, 1682.  See Belaef, pp. 203-209.\r\n\r\nThe old Communal organisation still existed on the estates of the\r\nproprietors, and had never been legally deprived of its authority, but\r\nit was now powerless to protect the members. The proprietor could easily\r\novercome any active resistance by selling or converting into domestic\r\nservants the peasants who dared to oppose his will.\r\n\r\nThe peasantry had thus sunk to the condition of serfs, practically\r\ndeprived of legal protection and subject to the arbitrary will of the\r\nproprietors; but they were still in some respects legally and actually\r\ndistinguished from the slaves on the one hand and the \"free wandering\r\npeople\" on the other. These distinctions were obliterated by Peter the\r\nGreat and his immediate successors.\r\n\r\nTo effect his great civil and military reforms, Peter required an\r\nannual revenue such as his predecessors had never dreamed of, and he\r\nwas consequently always on the look-out for some new object of taxation.\r\nWhen looking about for this purpose, his eye naturally fell on the\r\nslaves, the domestic servants, and the free agricultural labourers.\r\nNone of these classes paid taxes--a fact which stood in flagrant\r\ncontradiction with his fundamental principle of polity, that every\r\nsubject should in some way serve the State. He caused, therefore, a\r\nnational census to be taken, in which all the various classes of the\r\nrural population--slaves, domestic servants, agricultural labourers,\r\npeasants--should be inscribed in one category; and he imposed equally\r\non all the members of this category a poll-tax, in lieu of the former\r\nland-tax, which had lain exclusively on the peasants. To facilitate the\r\ncollection of this tax the proprietors were made responsible for their\r\nserfs; and the \"free wandering people\" who did not wish to enter the\r\narmy were ordered, under pain of being sent to the galleys, to inscribe\r\nthemselves as members of a Commune or as serfs to some proprietor.\r\n\r\nThese measures had a considerable influence, if not on the actual\r\nposition of the peasantry, at least on the legal conceptions regarding\r\nthem. By making the proprietor pay the poll-tax for his serfs, as if\r\nthey were slaves or cattle, the law seemed to sanction the idea that\r\nthey were part of his goods and chattels. Besides this, it introduced\r\nthe entirely new principle that any member of the rural population not\r\nlegally attached to the land or to a proprietor should be regarded as a\r\nvagrant, and treated accordingly. Thus the principle that every subject\r\nshould in some way serve the State had found its complete realisation.\r\nThere was no longer any room in Russia for free men.\r\n\r\nThe change in the position of the peasantry, together with the hardships\r\nand oppression by which it was accompanied, naturally increased\r\nfugitivism and vagrancy. Thousands of serfs ran away from their masters\r\nand fled to the steppe or sought enrolment in the army. To prevent this\r\nthe Government considered it necessary to take severe and energetic\r\nmeasures. The serfs were forbidden to enlist without the permission\r\nof their masters, and those who persisted in presenting themselves for\r\nenrolment were to be beaten \"cruelly\" (zhestoko) with the knout, and\r\nsent to the mines.* The proprietors, on the other hand, received the\r\nright to transport without trial their unruly serfs to Siberia, and even\r\nto send them to the mines for life.**\r\n\r\n     * Ukaz of June 2d, 1742.\r\n\r\n     ** See ukaz of January 17th, 1765, and of January 28th,\r\n     1766.\r\n\r\nIf these stringent measures had any effect it was not of long duration,\r\nfor there soon appeared among the serfs a still stronger spirit of\r\ndiscontent and insubordination, which threatened to produce a general\r\nagrarian rising, and actually did create a movement resembling in many\r\nrespects the Jacquerie in France and the Peasant War in Germany. A\r\nglance at the causes of this movement will help us to understand the\r\nreal nature of serfage in Russia.\r\n\r\nUp to this point serfage had, in spite of its flagrant abuses, a certain\r\ntheoretical justification. It was, as we have seen, merely a part of a\r\ngeneral political system in which obligatory service was imposed on all\r\nclasses of the population. The serfs served the nobles in order that the\r\nnobles might serve the Tsar. In 1762 this theory was entirely overturned\r\nby a manifesto of Peter III. abolishing the obligatory service of\r\nthe Noblesse. According to strict justice this act ought to have been\r\nfollowed by the liberation of the serfs, for if the nobles were no\r\nlonger obliged to serve the State they had no just claim to the service\r\nof the peasants. The Government had so completely forgotten the original\r\nmeaning of serfage that it never thought of carrying out the measure\r\nto its logical consequences, but the peasantry held tenaciously to\r\nthe ancient conceptions, and looked impatiently for a second manifesto\r\nliberating them from the power of the proprietors. Reports were spread\r\nthat such a manifesto really existed, and was being concealed by the\r\nnobles. A spirit of insubordination accordingly appeared among the rural\r\npopulation, and local insurrections broke out in several parts of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment Peter III. was dethroned and assassinated by a\r\nCourt conspiracy. The peasants, who, of course, knew nothing of the\r\nreal motives of the conspirators, supposed that the Tsar had been\r\nassassinated by those who wished to preserve serfage, and believed\r\nhim to be a martyr in the cause of Emancipation. At the news of the\r\ncatastrophe their hopes of Emancipation fell, but soon they were revived\r\nby new rumours. The Tsar, it was said, had escaped from the conspirators\r\nand was in hiding. Soon he would appear among his faithful peasants, and\r\nwith their aid would regain his throne and punish the wicked oppressors.\r\nAnxiously he was awaited, and at last the glad tidings came that he had\r\nappeared in the Don country, that thousands of Cossacks had joined\r\nhis standard, that he was everywhere putting the proprietors to death\r\nwithout mercy, and that he would soon arrive in the ancient capital!\r\n\r\nPeter III. was in reality in his grave, but there was a terrible element\r\nof truth in these reports. A pretender, a Cossack called Pugatchef, had\r\nreally appeared on the Don, and had assumed the role which the peasants\r\nexpected the late Tsar to play. Advancing through the country of the\r\nLower Volga, he took several places of importance, put to death all the\r\nproprietors he could find, defeated on more than one occasion the\r\ntroops sent against him, and threatened to advance into the heart of\r\nthe Empire. It seemed as if the old troublous times were about to be\r\nrenewed--as if the country was once more to be pillaged by those wild\r\nCossacks of the southern steppe. But the pretender showed himself\r\nincapable of playing the part he had assumed. His inhuman cruelty\r\nestranged many who would otherwise have followed him, and he was\r\ntoo deficient in decision and energy to take advantage of favourable\r\ncircumstances. If it be true that he conceived the idea of creating a\r\npeasant empire (muzhitskoe tsarstvo), he was not the man to realise such\r\na scheme. After a series of mistakes and defeats he was taken prisoner,\r\nand the insurrection was quelled.*\r\n\r\n     *Whilst living among the Bashkirs of the province of Samara\r\n     in 1872 I found some interesting traditions regarding this\r\n     pretender. Though nearly a century had elapsed since his\r\n     death (1775), his name, his personal appearance, and his\r\n     exploits were well known even to the younger generation.  My\r\n     informants firmly believed that he was not an impostor, but\r\n     the genuine Tsar, dethroned by his ambitious consort, and\r\n     that he never was taken prisoner, but \"went away into\r\n     foreign lands.\"  When I asked whether he was still alive,\r\n     and whether he might not one day return, they replied that\r\n     they did not know.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Peter III. had been succeeded by his consort, Catherine II. As\r\nshe had no legal right to the throne, and was by birth a foreigner, she\r\ncould not gain the affections of the people, and was obliged to court\r\nthe favour of the Noblesse. In such a difficult position she could not\r\nventure to apply her humane principles to the question of serfage. Even\r\nduring the first years of her reign, when she had no reason to fear\r\nagrarian disturbances, she increased rather than diminished the power of\r\nthe proprietors over their serfs, and the Pugatchef affair confirmed\r\nher in this line of policy. During her reign serfage may be said to have\r\nreached its climax. The serfs were regarded by the law as part of the\r\nmaster\u0027s immovable property*--as part of the working capital of the\r\nestate--and as such they were bought, sold, and given as presents** in\r\nhundreds and thousands, sometimes with the land, and sometimes without\r\nit, sometimes in families, and sometimes individually. The only legal\r\nrestriction was that they should not be offered for sale at the time of\r\nthe conscription, and that they should at no time be sold publicly\r\nby auction, because such a custom was considered as \"unbecoming in a\r\nEuropean State.\" In all other respects the serfs might be treated\r\nas private property; and this view is to be found not only in the\r\nlegislation, but also in the popular conceptions. It became customary--a\r\ncustom that continued down to the year 1861--to compute a noble\u0027s\r\nfortune, not by his yearly revenue or the extent of his estate, but\r\nby the number of his serfs. Instead of saying that a man had so many\r\nhundreds or thousands a year, or so many acres, it was commonly said\r\nthat he had so many hundreds or thousands of \"souls.\" And over these\r\n\"souls\" he exercised the most unlimited authority. The serfs had no\r\nlegal means of self-defence. The Government feared that the granting to\r\nthem of judicial or administrative protection would inevitably awaken\r\nin them a spirit of insubordination, and hence it was ordered that those\r\nwho presented complaints should be punished with the knout and sent\r\nto the mines.*** It was only in extreme cases, when some instance of\r\natrocious cruelty happened to reach the ears of the Sovereign, that the\r\nauthorities interfered with the proprietor\u0027s jurisdiction, and these\r\ncases had not the slightest influence on the proprietors in general.****\r\n\r\n     * See ukaz of October 7th, 1792.\r\n\r\n     ** As an example of making presents of serfs, the following\r\n     may be cited.  Count Panin presented some of his\r\n     subordinates for an Imperial recompense, and on receiving a\r\n     refusal, made them a present of 4000 serfs from his own\r\n     estates.--Belaef, p. 320.\r\n\r\n     *** See the ukazes of August 22d, 1767, and March 30th,\r\n     1781.\r\n\r\n     **** Perhaps the most horrible case on record is that of a\r\n     certain lady called Saltykof, who was brought to justice in\r\n     1768. According to the ukaz regarding her crimes, she had\r\n     killed by inhuman tortures in the course of ten or eleven\r\n     years about a hundred of her serfs, chiefly of the female\r\n     sex, and among them several young girls of eleven and twelve\r\n     years of age.  According to popular belief her cruelty\r\n     proceeded from cannibal propensities, but this was not\r\n     confirmed by the judicial investigation.  Details in the\r\n     Russki Arkhiv, 1865, pp. 644-652.  The atrocities practised\r\n     on the estate of Count Araktcheyef, the favourite of\r\n     Alexander I. at the commencement of last century, have been\r\n     frequently described, and are scarcely less revolting.\r\n\r\nThe last years of the eighteenth century may be regarded as the\r\nturning-point in the history of serfage. Up till that time the power\r\nof the proprietors had steadily increased, and the area of serfage had\r\nrapidly expanded. Under the Emperor Paul (1796-1801) we find the first\r\ndecided symptoms of a reaction. He regarded the proprietors as his most\r\nefficient officers of police, but he desired to limit their authority,\r\nand for this purpose issued an ukaz to the effect that the serfs should\r\nnot be forced to work for their masters more than three days in the\r\nweek. With the accession of Alexander I., in 1801, commenced a long\r\nseries of abortive projects for a general emancipation, and endless\r\nattempts to correct the more glaring abuses; and during the reign of\r\nNicholas no less than six committees were formed at different times to\r\nconsider the question. But the practical result of these efforts was\r\nextremely small. The custom of giving grants of land with peasants was\r\nabolished; certain slight restrictions were placed on the authority\r\nof the proprietors; a number of the worst specimens of the class\r\nwere removed from the administration of their estates; a few who\r\nwere convicted of atrocious cruelty were exiled to Siberia;* and some\r\nthousands of serfs were actually emancipated; but no decisive radical\r\nmeasures were attempted, and the serfs did not receive even the right of\r\nmaking formal complaints. Serfage had, in fact, come to be regarded as\r\na vital part of the State organisation, and the only sure basis for\r\nautocracy. It was therefore treated tenderly, and the rights and\r\nprotection accorded by various ukazes were almost entirely illusory.\r\n\r\n     *Speranski, for instance, when Governor of the province of\r\n     Penza, brought to justice, among others, a proprietor who\r\n     had caused one of his serfs to be flogged to death, and a\r\n     lady who had murdered a serf boy by pricking him with a\r\n     pen-knife because he had neglected to take proper care of a tame\r\n     rabbit committed to his charge!--Korff, \"Zhizn Speranskago,\"\r\n     II., p. 127, note.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the development of serfage in Russia and in Western\r\nEurope, we find very many points in common, but in Russia the movement\r\nhad certain peculiarities. One of the most important of these was caused\r\nby the rapid development of the Autocratic Power. In feudal Europe,\r\nwhere there was no strong central authority to control the Noblesse, the\r\nfree rural Communes entirely, or almost entirely, disappeared. They were\r\neither appropriated by the nobles or voluntarily submitted to powerful\r\nlanded proprietors or to monasteries, and in this way the whole of the\r\nreclaimed land, with a few rare exceptions, became the property of the\r\nnobles or of the Church. In Russia we find the same movement, but it\r\nwas arrested by the Imperial power before all the land had been\r\nappropriated. The nobles could reduce to serfage the peasants settled on\r\ntheir estates, but they could not take possession of the free Communes,\r\nbecause such an appropriation would have infringed the rights and\r\ndiminished the revenues of the Tsar. Down to the commencement of the\r\nlast century, it is true, large grants of land with serfs were made\r\nto favoured individuals among the Noblesse, and in the reign of Paul\r\n(1796-1801) a considerable number of estates were affected to the use\r\nof the Imperial family under the name of appanages (Udyelniya imteniya);\r\nbut on the other hand, the extensive Church lands, when secularised by\r\nCatherine II., were not distributed among the nobles, as in many other\r\ncountries, but were transformed into State Domains. Thus, at the date\r\nof the Emancipation (1861), by far the greater part of the territory\r\nbelonged to the State, and one-half of the rural population were\r\nso-called State Peasants (Gosudarstvenniye krestyanye).\r\n\r\nRegarding the condition of these State Peasants, or Peasants of the\r\nDomains, as they are sometimes called, I may say briefly that they were,\r\nin a certain sense, serfs, being attached to the soil like the others;\r\nbut their condition was, as a rule, somewhat better than the serfs in\r\nthe narrower acceptation of the term. They had to suffer much from the\r\ntyranny and extortion of the special administration under which they\r\nlived, but they had more land and more liberty than was commonly enjoyed\r\non the estates of resident proprietors, and their position was much less\r\nprecarious. It is often asserted that the officials of the Domains were\r\nworse than the serf-owners, because they had not the same interest in\r\nthe prosperity of the peasantry; but this a priori reasoning does not\r\nstand the test of experience.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little interesting to observe the numerical proportion\r\nand geographical distribution of these two rural classes. In European\r\nRussia, as a whole, about three-eighths of the population were composed\r\nof serfs belonging to the nobles;* but if we take the provinces\r\nseparately we find great variations from this average. In five provinces\r\nthe serfs were less than three per cent., while in others they formed\r\nmore than seventy per cent. of the population! This is not an accidental\r\nphenomenon. In the geographical distribution of serfage we can see\r\nreflected the origin and history of the institution.\r\n\r\n     * The exact numbers, according to official data, were--Entire\r\n          Population                                 60,909,309\r\n     Peasantry of all Classes                          49,486,665\r\n\r\n     Of these latter there were--State Peasants\r\n          23,138,191\r\n     Peasants on the Lands of Proprietors              23,022,390\r\n     Peasants of the Appanages and other Departments    3,326,084\r\n     ----------\r\n          49,486,665\r\n\r\nIf we were to construct a map showing the geographical distribution of\r\nthe serf population, we should at once perceive that serfage radiated\r\nfrom Moscow. Starting from that city as a centre and travelling in any\r\ndirection towards the confines of the Empire, we find that, after making\r\nallowance for a few disturbing local influences, the proportion of serfs\r\nregularly declines in the successive provinces traversed. In the region\r\nrepresenting the old Muscovite Tsardom they form considerably more than\r\na half of the rural population. Immediately to the south and east of\r\nthis, in the territory that was gradually annexed during the seventeenth\r\nand first half of the eighteenth century, the proportion varies from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty per cent., and in the more recently annexed\r\nprovinces it steadily decreases till it almost reaches zero.\r\n\r\nWe may perceive, too, that the percentage of serfs decreases towards the\r\nnorth much more rapidly than towards the east and south. This points to\r\nthe essentially agricultural nature of serfage in its infancy. In the\r\nsouth and east there was abundance of rich \"black earth\" celebrated for\r\nits fertility, and the nobles in quest of estates naturally preferred\r\nthis region to the inhospitable north, with its poor soil and severe\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nA more careful examination of the supposed map* would bring out other\r\ninteresting facts. Let me notice one by way of illustration. Had serfage\r\nbeen the result of conquest we should have found the Slavonic race\r\nsettled on the State Domains, and the Finnish and Tartar tribes\r\nsupplying the serfs of the nobles. In reality we find quite the reverse;\r\nthe Finns and Tartars were nearly all State Peasants, and the serfs\r\nof the proprietors were nearly all of Slavonic race. This is to be\r\naccounted for by the fact that the Finnish and Tartar tribes inhabit\r\nchiefly the outlying regions, in which serfage never attained such\r\ndimensions as in the centre of the Empire.\r\n\r\n     * Such a map was actually constructed by Troinitski\r\n     (\"Krepostnoe Naseleniye v Rossii,\" St. Petersburg, 1861),\r\n     but it is not nearly so graphic as is might have been.\r\n\r\nThe dues paid by the serfs were of three kinds: labour, money, and farm\r\nproduce. The last-named is so unimportant that it may be dismissed in\r\na few words. It consisted chiefly of eggs, chickens, lambs, mushrooms,\r\nwild berries, and linen cloth. The amount of these various products\r\ndepended entirely on the will of the master. The other two kinds of\r\ndues, as more important, we must examine more closely.\r\n\r\nWhen a proprietor had abundance of fertile land and wished to farm on\r\nhis own account, he commonly demanded from his serfs as much labour as\r\npossible. Under such a master the serfs were probably free from money\r\ndues, and fulfilled their obligations to him by labouring in his fields\r\nin summer and transporting his grain to market in winter. When, on the\r\ncontrary, a land-owner had more serf labour at his disposal than he\r\nrequired for the cultivation of his fields, he put the superfluous serfs\r\n\"on obrok,\"--that is to say, he allowed them to go and work where they\r\npleased on condition of paying him a fixed yearly sum. Sometimes the\r\nproprietor did not farm at all on his own account, in which case he put\r\nall the serfs \"on obrok,\" and generally gave to the Commune in usufruct\r\nthe whole of the arable land and pasturage. In this way the Mir played\r\nthe part of a tenant.\r\n\r\nWe have here the basis for a simple and important classification of\r\nestates in the time of serfage: (1) Estates on which the dues were\r\nexclusively in labour; (2) estates on which the dues were partly in\r\nlabour and partly in money; and (3) estates on which the dues were\r\nexclusively in money.\r\n\r\nIn the manner of exacting the labour dues there was considerable\r\nvariety. According to the famous manifesto of Paul I., the peasant could\r\nnot be compelled to work more than three days in the week; but this law\r\nwas by no means universally observed, and those who did observe it had\r\nvarious methods of applying it. A few took it literally and laid down\r\na rule that the serfs should work for them three definite days in the\r\nweek--for example, every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday--but this was\r\nan extremely inconvenient method, for it prevented the field labour\r\nfrom being carried on regularly. A much more rational system was that\r\naccording to which one-half of the serfs worked the first three days of\r\nthe week, and the other half the remaining three. In this way there was,\r\nwithout any contravention of the law, a regular and constant supply of\r\nlabour. It seems, however, that the great majority of the proprietors\r\nfollowed no strict method, and paid no attention whatever to Paul\u0027s\r\nmanifesto, which gave to the peasants no legal means of making formal\r\ncomplaints. They simply summoned daily as many labourers as they\r\nrequired. The evil consequences of this for the peasants\u0027 crops were in\r\npart counteracted by making the peasants sow their own grain a little\r\nlater than that of the proprietor, so that the master\u0027s harvest work\r\nwas finished, or nearly finished, before their grain was ripe. This\r\ncombination did not, however, always succeed, and in cases where there\r\nwas a conflict of interests, the serf was, of course, the losing party.\r\nAll that remained for him to do in such cases was to work a little in\r\nhis own fields before six o\u0027clock in the morning and after nine o\u0027clock\r\nat night, and in order to render this possible he economised his\r\nstrength, and worked as little as possible in his master\u0027s fields during\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been remarked, and with much truth--though\r\nthe indiscriminate application of the principle has often led to\r\nunjustifiable legislative inactivity--that the practical result of\r\ninstitutions depends less on the intrinsic abstract nature of the\r\ninstitutions themselves than on the character of those who work them.\r\nSo it was with serfage. When a proprietor habitually acted towards his\r\nserfs in an enlightened, rational, humane way, they had little reason to\r\ncomplain of their position, and their life was much easier than that\r\nof many men who live in a state of complete individual freedom and\r\nunlimited, unrestricted competition. However paradoxical the statement\r\nmay seem to those who are in the habit of regarding all forms of slavery\r\nfrom the sentimental point of view, it is unquestionable that the\r\ncondition of serfs under such a proprietor as I have supposed was more\r\nenviable than that of the majority of English agricultural labourers.\r\nEach family had a house of its own, with a cabbage-garden, one or\r\nmore horses, one or two cows, several sheep, poultry, agricultural\r\nimplements, a share of the Communal land, and everything else necessary\r\nfor carrying on its small farming operations; and in return for this it\r\nhad to supply the proprietor with an amount of labour which was by no\r\nmeans oppressive. If, for instance, a serf had three adult sons--and the\r\nhouseholds, as I have said, were at that time generally numerous--two of\r\nthem might work for the proprietor whilst he himself and the remaining\r\nson could attend exclusively to the family affairs. By the events which\r\nused to be called \"the visitations of God\" he had no fear of being\r\npermanently ruined. If his house was burnt, or his cattle died from the\r\nplague, or a series of \"bad years\" left him without seed for his fields,\r\nhe could always count upon temporary assistance from his master. He was\r\nprotected, too, against all oppression and exactions on the part of the\r\nofficials; for the police, when there was any call for its interference,\r\napplied to the proprietor, who was to a certain extent responsible for\r\nhis serfs. Thus the serf might live a tranquil, contented life, and die\r\nat a ripe old age, without ever having been conscious that serfage was a\r\ngrievous burden.\r\n\r\nIf all the serfs had lived in this way we might, perhaps, regret that\r\nthe Emancipation was ever undertaken. In reality there was, as the\r\nFrench say, le revers de la medaille, and serfage generally appeared\r\nunder a form very different from that which I have just depicted. The\r\nproprietors were, unfortunately, not all of the enlightened, humane\r\ntype. Amongst them were many who demanded from their serfs an inordinate\r\namount of labour, and treated them in a very inhuman fashion.\r\n\r\nThese oppressors of their serfs may be divided into four categories.\r\nFirst, there were the proprietors who managed their own estates, and\r\noppressed simply for the purpose of increasing their revenues. Secondly,\r\nthere were a number of retired officers who wished to establish a\r\ncertain order and discipline on their estates, and who employed for this\r\npurpose the barbarous measures which were at that time used in the\r\narmy, believing that merciless corporal punishment was the only means of\r\ncuring laziness, disorderliness and other vices. Thirdly, there were the\r\nabsentees who lived beyond their means, and demanded from their steward,\r\nunder pain of giving him or his son as a recruit, a much greater yearly\r\nsum than the estate could be reasonably expected to yield. Lastly,\r\nin the latter years of serfage, there were a number of men who bought\r\nestates as a mercantile speculation, and made as much money out of them\r\nas they could in the shortest possible space of time.\r\n\r\nOf all hard masters, the last-named were the most terrible. Utterly\r\nindifferent to the welfare of the serfs and the ultimate fate of the\r\nproperty, they cut down the timber, sold the cattle, exacted heavy money\r\ndues under threats of giving the serfs or their children as recruits,\r\npresented to the military authorities a number of conscripts greater\r\nthan was required by law--selling the conscription receipts (zatchetniya\r\nkvitantsii) to the merchants and burghers who were liable to the\r\nconscription but did not wish to serve--compelled some of the richer\r\nserfs to buy their liberty at an enormous price, and, in a word, used\r\nevery means, legal and illegal, for extracting money. By this system\r\nof management they ruined the estate completely in the course of a few\r\nyears; but by that time they had realised probably the whole sum paid,\r\nwith a very fair profit from the operation; and this profit could be\r\nconsiderably augmented by selling a number of the peasant families\r\nfor transportation to another estate (na svoz), or by mortgaging the\r\nproperty in the Opekunski Sovet--a Government institution which lent\r\nmoney on landed property without examining carefully the nature of the\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nAs to the means which the proprietors possessed of oppressing their\r\npeasants, we must distinguish between the legal and the actual. The\r\nlegal were almost as complete as any one could desire. \"The proprietor,\"\r\nit is said in the Laws (Vol. IX, p. 1045, ed. an. 1857), \"may impose on\r\nhis serfs every kind of labour, may take from them money dues (obrok)\r\nand demand from them personal service, with this one restriction, that\r\nthey should not be thereby ruined, and that the number of days fixed by\r\nlaw should be left to them for their own work.\"* Besides this, he had\r\nthe right to transform peasants into domestic servants, and might,\r\ninstead of employing them in his own service, hire them out to others\r\nwho had the rights and privileges of Noblesse (pp. 1047-48). For\r\nall offences committed against himself or against any one under his\r\njurisdiction he could subject the guilty ones to corporal punishment not\r\nexceeding forty lashes with the birch or fifteen blows with the stick\r\n(p. 1052); and if he considered any of his serfs as incorrigible, he\r\ncould present them to the authorities to be drafted into the army or\r\ntransported to Siberia as he might desire (pp. 1053-55). In cases of\r\ninsubordination, where the ordinary domestic means of discipline did\r\nnot suffice, he could call in the police and the military to support his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n     * I give here the references to the Code, because Russians\r\n     commonly believe and assert that the hiring out of serfs,\r\n     the infliction of corporal punishment, and similar practices\r\n     were merely abuses unauthorised by law.\r\n\r\nSuch were the legal means by which the proprietor might oppress\r\nhis peasants, and it will be readily understood that they were very\r\nconsiderable and very elastic. By law he had the power to impose any\r\ndues in labour or money which he might think fit, and in all cases\r\nthe serfs were ordered to be docile and obedient (p. 1027). Corporal\r\npunishment, though restricted by law, he could in reality apply to any\r\nextent. Certainly none of the serfs, and very few of the proprietors,\r\nwere aware that the law placed any restriction on this right. All the\r\nproprietors were in the habit of using corporal punishment as they\r\nthought proper, and unless a proprietor became notorious for inhuman\r\ncruelty the authorities never thought of interfering. But in the eyes\r\nof the peasants corporal punishment was not the worst. What they feared\r\ninfinitely more than the birch or the stick was the proprietor\u0027s power\r\nof giving them or their sons as recruits. The law assumed that this\r\nextreme means would be employed only against those serfs who showed\r\nthemselves incorrigibly vicious or insubordinate; but the authorities\r\naccepted those presented without making any investigations, and\r\nconsequently the proprietor might use this power as an effective means\r\nof extortion.\r\n\r\nAgainst these means of extortion and oppression the serfs had no\r\nlegal protection. The law provided them with no means of resisting any\r\ninjustice to which they might be subjected, or of bringing to\r\npunishment the master who oppressed and ruined them. The Government,\r\nnotwithstanding its sincere desire to protect them from inordinate\r\nburdens and cruel treatment, rarely interfered between the master and\r\nhis serfs, being afraid of thereby undermining the authority of\r\nthe proprietors, and awakening among the peasantry a spirit of\r\ninsubordination. The serfs were left, therefore, to their own resources,\r\nand had to defend themselves as best they could. The simplest way was\r\nopen mutiny; but this was rarely employed, for they knew by experience\r\nthat any attempt of the kind would be at once put down by the military\r\nand mercilessly punished. Much more favourite and efficient methods were\r\npassive resistance, flight, and fire-raising or murder.\r\n\r\nWe might naturally suppose that an unscrupulous proprietor, armed with\r\nthe enormous legal and actual power which I have just described, could\r\nvery easily extort from his peasants anything he desired. In reality,\r\nhowever, the process of extortion, when it exceeded a certain measure,\r\nwas a very difficult operation. The Russian peasant has a capacity\r\nof patient endurance that would do honour to a martyr, and a power of\r\ncontinued, dogged, passive resistance such as is possessed, I believe,\r\nby no other class of men in Europe; and these qualities formed a very\r\npowerful barrier against the rapacity of unconscientious proprietors.\r\nAs soon as the serfs remarked in their master a tendency to rapacity and\r\nextortion, they at once took measures to defend themselves. Their first\r\nstep was to sell secretly the live stock they did not actually require,\r\nand all their movable property except the few articles necessary for\r\neveryday use; then the little capital realised was carefully hidden.\r\n\r\nWhen this had been effected, the proprietor might threaten and punish\r\nas he liked, but he rarely succeeded in unearthing the treasure. Many\r\na peasant, under such circumstances, bore patiently the most cruel\r\npunishment, and saw his sons taken away as recruits, and yet he\r\npersisted in declaring that he had no money to ransom himself and his\r\nchildren. A spectator in such a case would probably have advised him\r\nto give up his little store of money, and thereby liberate himself from\r\npersecution; but the peasants reasoned otherwise. They were convinced,\r\nand not without reason, that the sacrifice of their little capital would\r\nmerely put off the evil day, and that the persecution would very soon\r\nrecommence. In this way they would have to suffer as before, and have\r\nthe additional mortification of feeling that they had spent to no\r\npurpose the little that they possessed. Their fatalistic belief in the\r\n\"perhaps\" (avos\u0027) came here to their aid. Perhaps the proprietor might\r\nbecome weary of his efforts when he saw that they led to no result, or\r\nperhaps something might occur which would remove the persecutor.\r\n\r\nIt always happened, however, that when a proprietor treated his serfs\r\nwith extreme injustice and cruelty, some of them lost patience, and\r\nsought refuge in flight. As the estates lay perfectly open on all sides,\r\nand it was utterly impossible to exercise a strict supervision, nothing\r\nwas easier than to run away, and the fugitive might be a hundred miles\r\noff before his absence was noticed. But the oppressed serf was reluctant\r\nto adopt such an extreme measure. He had almost always a wife and\r\nfamily, and he could not possibly take them with him; flight, therefore,\r\nwas expatriation for life in its most terrible form. Besides this, the\r\nlife of a fugitive was by no means enviable. He was liable at any moment\r\nto fall into the hands of the police, and to be put into prison or sent\r\nback to his master. So little charm, indeed, did this life present that\r\nnot infrequently after a few months or a few years the fugitive returned\r\nof his own accord to his former domicile.\r\n\r\nRegarding fugitives or passportless wanderers in general, I may here\r\nremark parenthetically that there were two kinds. In the first place,\r\nthere was the young, able-bodied peasant, who fled from the oppression\r\nof his master or from the conscription. Such a fugitive almost always\r\nsought out for himself a new domicile--generally in the southern\r\nprovinces, where there was a great scarcity of labourers, and where many\r\nproprietors habitually welcomed all peasants who presented themselves,\r\nwithout making any inquiries as to passports. In the second place, there\r\nwere those who chose fugitivism as a permanent mode of life. These\r\nwere, for the most part, men or women of a certain age--widowers or\r\nwidows--who had no close family ties, and who were too infirm or too\r\nlazy to work. The majority of these assumed the character of pilgrims.\r\nAs such they could always find enough to eat, and could generally even\r\ncollect a few roubles with which to grease the palm of any zealous\r\npolice-officer who should arrest them. For a life of this kind Russia\r\npresented peculiar facilities. There was abundance of monasteries, where\r\nall comers could live for three days without questions being asked, and\r\nwhere those who were willing to do a little work for the patron saint\r\nmight live for a much longer period. Then there were the towns,\r\nwhere the rich merchants considered almsgiving as very profitable for\r\nsalvation. And, lastly, there were the villages, where a professing\r\npilgrim was sure to be hospitably received and entertained so long as he\r\nrefrained from stealing and other acts too grossly inconsistent with his\r\nassumed character. For those who contented themselves with simple fare,\r\nand did not seek to avoid the usual privations of a wanderer\u0027s life,\r\nthese ordinary means of subsistence were amply sufficient. Those who\r\nwere more ambitious and more cunning often employed their talents with\r\ngreat success in the world of the Old Ritualists and Sectarians.\r\n\r\nThe last and most desperate means of defense which the serfs possessed\r\nwere fire-raising and murder. With regard to the amount of fire-raising\r\nthere are no trustworthy statistics. With regard to the number of\r\nagrarian murders I once obtained some interesting statistical data, but\r\nunfortunately lost them. I may say, however, that these cases were\r\nnot very numerous. This is to be explained in part by the patient,\r\nlong-suffering character of the peasantry, and in part by the fact that\r\nthe great majority of the proprietors were by no means such inhuman\r\ntaskmasters as is sometimes supposed. When a case did occur, the\r\nAdministration always made a strict investigation--punishing the guilty\r\nwith exemplary severity, and taking no account of the provocation to\r\nwhich they had been subjected. The peasantry, on the contrary--at least,\r\nwhen the act was not the result of mere personal vengeance--secretly\r\nsympathised with \"the unfortunates,\" and long cherished their memory as\r\nthat of men who had suffered for the Mir.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the serfs I have hitherto confined my attention to the\r\nmembers of the Mir, or rural Commune--that is to say, the peasants\r\nin the narrower sense of the term; but besides these there were the\r\nDvorovuye, or domestic servants, and of these I must add a word or two.\r\n\r\nThe Dvorovuye were domestic slaves rather than serfs in the proper\r\nsense of the term. Let us, however, avoid wounding unnecessarily Russian\r\nsensibilities by the use of the ill-sounding word. We may call the class\r\nin question \"domestics\"--remembering, of course, that they were not\r\nquite domestic servants in the ordinary sense. They received no wages,\r\nwere not at liberty to change masters, possessed almost no legal rights,\r\nand might be punished, hired out, or sold by their owners without any\r\ninfraction of the written law.\r\n\r\nThese \"domestics\" were very numerous--out of all proportion to the work\r\nto be performed--and could consequently lead a very lazy life;* but\r\nthe peasant considered it a great misfortune to be transferred to their\r\nranks, for he thereby lost his share of the Communal land and the little\r\nindependence which he enjoyed. It very rarely happened, however, that\r\nthe proprietor took an able-bodied peasant as domestic. The class\r\ngenerally kept up its numbers by the legitimate and illegitimate method\r\nof natural increase; and involuntary additions were occasionally made\r\nwhen orphans were left without near relatives, and no other family\r\nwished to adopt them. To this class belonged the lackeys, servant-girls,\r\ncooks, coachmen, stable-boys, gardeners, and a large number of\r\nnondescript old men and women who had no very clearly defined functions.\r\nIf the proprietor had a private theatre or orchestra, it was from this\r\nclass that the actors and musicians were drawn. Those of them who were\r\nmarried and had children occupied a position intermediate between\r\nthe ordinary domestic servant and the peasant. On the one hand, they\r\nreceived from the master a monthly allowance of food and a yearly\r\nallowance of clothes, and they were obliged to live in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the mansion-house; but, on the other hand, they had each a\r\nseparate house or apartment, with a little cabbage-garden, and commonly\r\na small plot of flax. The unmarried ones lived in all respects like\r\nordinary domestic servants.\r\n\r\n     * Those proprietors who kept orchestras, large packs of\r\n     hounds, \u0026c., had sometimes several hundred domestic serfs.\r\n\r\nThe number of these domestic serfs being generally out of all proportion\r\nto the amount of work they had to perform, they were imbued with a\r\nhereditary spirit of indolence, and they performed lazily and carelessly\r\nwhat they had to do. On the other hand, they were often sincerely\r\nattached to the family they served, and occasionally proved by acts\r\ntheir fidelity and attachment. Here is an instance out of many for which\r\nI can vouch. An old nurse, whose mistress was dangerously ill,\r\nvowed that, in the event of the patient\u0027s recovery, she would make a\r\npilgrimage, first to Kief, the Holy City on the Dnieper, and afterwards\r\nto Solovetsk, a much revered monastery on an island in the White Sea.\r\nThe patient recovered, and the old woman, in fulfilment of her vow,\r\nwalked more than two thousand miles!\r\n\r\nThis class of serfs might well be called domestic slaves, but I must\r\nwarn the reader that he ought not to use the expression when speaking\r\nwith Russians, because they are extremely sensitive on the point.\r\nSerfage, they say, was something quite different from slavery, and\r\nslavery never existed in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this assertion is perfectly true, and the second\r\npart perfectly false. In old times, as I have said above, slavery was a\r\nrecognised institution in Russia as in other countries. One can hardly\r\nread a few pages of the old chronicles without stumbling on references\r\nto slaves; and I distinctly remember--though I cannot at this moment\r\ngive chapter and verse--that one of the old Russian Princes was so\r\nvaliant and so successful in his wars that during his reign a slave\r\nmight be bought for a few coppers. As late as the beginning of last\r\ncentury the domestic serfs were sold very much as domestic slaves\r\nused to be sold in countries where slavery was recognised as a legal\r\ninstitution. Here is an example of the customary advertisement; I take\r\nit almost at random from the Moscow Gazette of 1801:--\"TO BE SOLD: three\r\ncoachmen, well trained and handsome; and two girls, the one eighteen,\r\nand the other fifteen years of age, both of them good-looking, and well\r\nacquainted with various kinds of handiwork. In the same house there are\r\nfor sale two hairdressers; the one, twenty-one years of age, can read,\r\nwrite, play on a musical instrument, and act as huntsman; the other can\r\ndress ladies\u0027 and gentlemen\u0027s hair. In the same house are sold pianos\r\nand organs.\"\r\n\r\nA little farther on in the same number of the paper, a first-rate clerk,\r\na carver, and a lackey are offered for sale, and the reason assigned is\r\na superabundance of the articles in question (za izlishestvom). In some\r\ninstances it seems as if the serfs and the cattle were intentionally put\r\nin the same category, as in the following announcement: \"In this house\r\none can buy a coachman and a Dutch cow about to calve.\" The style of\r\nthese advertisements, and the frequent recurrence of the same\r\naddresses, show that there was at this time in Moscow a regular class of\r\nslave-dealers. The humane Alexander I. prohibited advertisements of this\r\nkind, but he did not put down the custom which they represented, and his\r\nsuccessor, Nicholas I., took no effective measures for its repression.\r\n\r\nOf the whole number of serfs belonging to the proprietors, the domestics\r\nformed, according to the census of 1857, no less than 6 3/4 per cent.\r\n(6.79), and their numbers were evidently rapidly increasing, for in the\r\npreceding census they represented only 4.79 per cent. of the whole. This\r\nfact seems all the more significant when we observe that during this\r\nperiod the number of peasant serfs had diminished.\r\n\r\nI must now bring this long chapter to an end. My aim has been to\r\nrepresent serfage in its normal, ordinary forms rather than in its\r\noccasional monstrous manifestations. Of these latter I have a collection\r\ncontaining ample materials for a whole series of sensation novels, but\r\nI refrain from quoting them, because I do not believe that the criminal\r\nannals of a country give a fair representation of its real condition. On\r\nthe other hand, I do not wish to whitewash serfage or attenuate its\r\nevil consequences. No great body of men could long wield such enormous\r\nuncontrolled power without abusing it,* and no large body of men could\r\nlong live under such power without suffering morally and materially from\r\nits pernicious influence. If serfage did not create that moral apathy\r\nand intellectual lethargy which formed, as it were, the atmosphere of\r\nRussian provincial life, it did much at least to preserve it. In short,\r\nserfage was the chief barrier to all material and moral progress, and\r\nin a time of moral awakening such as that which I have described in the\r\npreceding chapter, the question of Emancipation naturally came at once\r\nto the front.\r\n\r\n     * The number of deposed proprietors--or rather the number of\r\n     estates placed under curators in consequence of the abuse of\r\n     authority on the part of their owners--amounted in 1859 to\r\n     215.  So at least I found in an official MS. document shown\r\n     to me by the late Nicholas Milutin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Question Raised--Chief Committee--The Nobles of the Lithuanian\r\nProvinces--The Tsar\u0027s Broad Hint to the Noblesse--Enthusiasm in the\r\nPress--The Proprietors--Political Aspirations--No Opposition--The\r\nGovernment--Public Opinion--Fear of the Proletariat--The Provincial\r\nCommittees--The Elaboration Commission--The Question Ripens--Provincial\r\nDeputies--Discontent and Demonstrations--The Manifesto--Fundamental\r\nPrinciples of the Law--Illusions and Disappointment of the\r\nSerfs--Arbiters of the Peace--A Characteristic Incident--Redemption--Who\r\nEffected the Emancipation?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental principle of Russian political organisation that\r\nall initiative in public affairs proceeds from the Autocratic Power. The\r\nwidespread desire, therefore, for the Emancipation of the serfs did not\r\nfind free expression so long as the Emperor kept silence regarding his\r\nintentions. The educated classes watched anxiously for some sign, and\r\nsoon a sign was given to them. In March, 1856--a few days after the\r\npublication of the manifesto announcing the conclusion of peace with the\r\nWestern Powers--his Majesty said to the Marshals of Noblesse in Moscow:\r\n\"For the removal of certain unfounded reports I consider it necessary to\r\ndeclare to you that I have not at present the intention of annihilating\r\nserfage; but certainly, as you yourselves know, the existing manner\r\nof possessing serfs cannot remain unchanged. It is better to abolish\r\nserfage from above than to await the time when it will begin to abolish\r\nitself from below. I request you, gentlemen, to consider how this can\r\nbe put into execution, and to submit my words to the Noblesse for their\r\nconsideration.\"\r\n\r\nThese words were intended to sound the Noblesse and induce them to make\r\na voluntary proposal, but they had not the desired effect. Abolitionist\r\nenthusiasm was rare among the great nobles, and those who really wished\r\nto see serfage abolished considered the Imperial utterance too vague and\r\noracular to justify them in taking the initiative. As no further steps\r\nwere taken for some time, the excitement caused by the incident soon\r\nsubsided, and many people assumed that the consideration of the\r\nproblem had been indefinitely postponed. \"The Government,\" it was\r\nsaid, \"evidently intended to raise the question, but on perceiving\r\nthe indifference or hostility of the landed proprietors, it became\r\nfrightened and drew back.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was in reality disappointed. He had expected that his\r\n\"faithful Moscow Noblesse,\" of which he was wont to say he was himself a\r\nmember, would at once respond to his call, and that the ancient capital\r\nwould have the honour of beginning the work. And if the example were\r\nthus given by Moscow, he had no doubt that it would soon be followed by\r\nthe other provinces. He now perceived that the fundamental principles\r\non which the Emancipation should be effected must be laid down by the\r\nGovernment, and for this purpose he created a secret committee composed\r\nof several great officers of State.\r\n\r\nThis \"Chief Committee for Peasant Affairs,\" as it was afterwards called,\r\ndevoted six months to studying the history of the question. Emancipation\r\nschemes were by no means a new phenomenon in Russia. Ever since the time\r\nof Catherine II. the Government had thought of improving the condition\r\nof the serfs, and on more than one occasion a general emancipation had\r\nbeen contemplated. In this way the question had slowly ripened,\r\nand certain fundamental principles had come to be pretty generally\r\nrecognised. Of these principles the most important was that the State\r\nshould not consent to any project which would uproot the peasant from\r\nthe soil and allow him to wander about at will; for such a measure would\r\nrender the collection of the taxes impossible, and in all probability\r\nproduce the most frightful agrarian disorders. And to this general\r\nprinciple there was an important corollary: if severe restrictions were\r\nto be placed on free migration, it would be necessary to provide the\r\npeasantry with land in the immediate vicinity of the villages; otherwise\r\nthey must inevitably fall back under the power of the proprietors, and\r\na new and worse kind of serfage would thus be created. But in order to\r\ngive land to the peasantry it would be necessary to take it from the\r\nproprietors; and this expropriation seemed to many a most unjustifiable\r\ninfringement of the sacred rights of property. It was this consideration\r\nthat had restrained Nicholas from taking any decisive measures with\r\nregard to serfage; and it had now considerable weight with the members\r\nof the committee, who were nearly all great land-owners.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the strenuous exertions of the Grand Duke Constantine,\r\nwho had been appointed a member for the express purpose of accelerating\r\nthe proceedings, the committee did not show as much zeal and energy as\r\nwas desired, and orders were given to take some decided step. At that\r\nmoment a convenient opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\nIn the Lithuanian Provinces, where the nobles were Polish by origin and\r\nsympathies, the miserable condition of the peasantry had induced the\r\nGovernment in the preceding reign to limit the arbitrary power of the\r\nserf-owners by so-called Inventories, in which the mutual obligations\r\nof masters and serfs were regulated and defined. These Inventories had\r\ncaused great dissatisfaction, and the proprietors now proposed that they\r\nshould be revised. Of this the Government determined to take advantage.\r\nOn the somewhat violent assumption that these proprietors wished to\r\nemancipate their serfs, an Imperial rescript was prepared approving of\r\ntheir supposed desire, and empowering them to form committees for the\r\npreparation of definite projects.* In the rescript itself the word\r\nemancipation was studiously avoided, but there could be no doubt as to\r\nthe implied meaning, for it was expressly stated in the supplementary\r\nconsiderations that \"the abolition of serfage must be effected not\r\nsuddenly, but gradually.\" Four days later the Minister of the Interior,\r\nin accordance with a secret order from the Emperor, sent a circular to\r\nthe Governors and Marshals of Noblesse all over Russia proper, informing\r\nthem that the nobles of the Lithuanian Provinces \"had recognised the\r\nnecessity of liberating the peasants,\" and that \"this noble intention\"\r\nhad afforded peculiar satisfaction to his Majesty. A copy of the\r\nrescript and the fundamental principles to be observed accompanied\r\nthe circular, \"in case the nobles of other provinces should express a\r\nsimilar desire.\"\r\n\r\n     * This celebrated document is known as \"The Rescript to\r\n     Nazimof.\" More than once in the course of conversation I did\r\n     all in my power, within the limits of politeness and\r\n     discretion, to extract from General Nazimof a detailed\r\n     account of this important episode, but my efforts were\r\n     unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThis circular produced an immense sensation throughout the country. No\r\none could for a moment misunderstand the suggestion that the nobles of\r\nother provinces MIGHT POSSIBLY express a desire to liberate their serfs.\r\nSuch vague words, when spoken by an autocrat, have a very definite and\r\nunmistakable meaning, which prudent loyal subjects have no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding. If any doubted, their doubts were soon dispelled, for\r\nthe Emperor, a few weeks later, publicly expressed a hope that, with\r\nthe help of God and the co-operation of the nobles, the work would be\r\nsuccessfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe die was cast, and the Government looked anxiously to see the result.\r\n\r\nThe periodical Press--which was at once the product and the fomenter\r\nof the liberal aspirations--hailed the raising of the question with\r\nboundless enthusiasm. The Emancipation, it was said, would certainly\r\nopen a new and glorious epoch in the national history. Serfage was\r\ndescribed as an ulcer that had long been poisoning the national blood;\r\nas an enormous weight under which the whole nation groaned; as an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle, preventing all material and moral progress; as\r\na cumbrous load which rendered all free, vigorous action impossible,\r\nand prevented Russia from rising to the level of the Western nations. If\r\nRussia had succeeded in stemming the flood of adverse fortune in spite\r\nof this millstone round her neck, what might she not accomplish when\r\nfree and untrammelled? All sections of the literary world had arguments\r\nto offer in support of the foregone conclusion. The moralists declared\r\nthat all the prevailing vices were the product of serfage, and that\r\nmoral progress was impossible in an atmosphere of slavery; the lawyers\r\nheld that the arbitrary authority of the proprietors over the peasants\r\nhad no legal basis; the economists explained that free labour was an\r\nindispensable condition of industrial and commercial prosperity; the\r\nphilosophical historians showed that the normal historical development\r\nof the country demanded the immediate abolition of this superannuated\r\nremnant of barbarism; and the writers of the sentimental, gushing type\r\npoured forth endless effusions about brotherly love to the weak and\r\nthe oppressed. In a word, the Press was for the moment unanimous,\r\nand displayed a feverish excitement which demanded a liberal use of\r\nsuperlatives.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiastic tone accorded perfectly with the feelings of a large\r\nsection of the nobles. Nearly the whole of the Noblesse was more or less\r\naffected by the newborn enthusiasm for everything just, humanitarian,\r\nand liberal. The aspirations found, of course, their most ardent\r\nrepresentatives among the educated youth; but they were by no means\r\nconfined to the younger men, who had passed through the universities and\r\nhad always regarded serfage as a stain on the national honour. Many a\r\nSaul was found among the prophets. Many an old man, with grey hairs and\r\ngrandchildren, who had all his life placidly enjoyed the fruits of serf\r\nlabour, was now heard to speak of serfage as an antiquated institution\r\nwhich could not be reconciled with modern humanitarian ideas; and not\r\na few of all ages, who had formerly never thought of reading books\r\nor newspapers, now perused assiduously the periodical literature, and\r\npicked up the liberal and humanitarian phrases with which it was filled.\r\n\r\nThis Abolitionist fervour was considerably augmented by certain\r\npolitical aspirations which did not appear in the newspapers, but\r\nwhich were at that time very generally entertained. In spite of the\r\nPress-censure a large section of the educated classes had become\r\nacquainted with the political literature of France and Germany, and had\r\nimbibed therefrom an unbounded admiration for Constitutional government.\r\nA Constitution, it was thought, would necessarily remove all political\r\nevils and create something like a political Millennium. And it was\r\nnot to be a Constitution of the ordinary sort--the fruit of compromise\r\nbetween hostile political parties--but an institution designed calmly\r\naccording to the latest results of political science, and so constructed\r\nthat all classes would voluntarily contribute to the general welfare.\r\nThe necessary prelude to this happy era of political liberty was, of\r\ncourse, the abolition of serfage. When the nobles had given up\r\ntheir power over their serfs they would receive a Constitution as an\r\nindemnification and reward.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, many nobles of the old school who remained\r\nimpervious to all these new feelings and ideas. On them the raising\r\nof the Emancipation question had a very different effect. They had no\r\nsource of revenue but their estates, and they could not conceive the\r\npossibility of working their estates without serf labour. If the peasant\r\nwas indolent and careless even under strict supervision, what would he\r\nbecome when no longer under the authority of a master? If the profits\r\nfrom farming were already small, what would they be when no one would\r\nwork without wages? And this was not the worst, for it was quite evident\r\nfrom the circular that the land question was to be raised, and that a\r\nconsiderable portion of each estate would be transferred, at least for a\r\ntime, to the emancipated peasants.\r\n\r\nTo the proprietors who looked at the question in this way the prospect\r\nof Emancipation was certainly not at all agreeable, but we must not\r\nimagine that they felt as English land-owners would feel if threatened\r\nby a similar danger. In England a hereditary estate has for the family\r\na value far beyond what it would bring in the market. It is regarded as\r\none and indivisible, and any dismemberment of it would be looked upon\r\nas a grave family misfortune. In Russia, on the contrary, estates\r\nhave nothing of this semi-sacred character, and may be at any\r\ntime dismembered without outraging family feeling or traditional\r\nassociations. Indeed, it is not uncommon that when a proprietor dies,\r\nleaving only one estate and several children, the property is broken\r\nup into fractions and divided among the heirs. Even the prospect of\r\npecuniary sacrifice did not alarm the Russians so much as it would alarm\r\nEnglishmen. Men who keep no accounts and take little thought for the\r\nmorrow are much less averse to making pecuniary sacrifices--whether for\r\na wise or a foolish purpose--than those who carefully arrange their mode\r\nof life according to their income.\r\n\r\nStill, after due allowance has been made for these peculiarities, it\r\nmust be admitted that the feeling of dissatisfaction and alarm was very\r\nwidespread. Even Russians do not like the prospect of losing a part\r\nof their land and income. No protest, however, was entered, and no\r\nopposition was made. Those who were hostile to the measure were ashamed\r\nto show themselves selfish and unpatriotic. At the same time they knew\r\nvery well that the Emperor, if he wished, could effect the Emancipation\r\nin spite of them, and that resistance on their part would draw down\r\nupon them the Imperial displeasure, without affording any compensating\r\nadvantage. They knew, too, that there was a danger from below, so that\r\nany useless show of opposition would be like playing with matches in a\r\npowder-magazine. The serfs would soon hear that the Tsar desired to set\r\nthem free, and they might, if they suspected that the proprietors\r\nwere trying to frustrate the Tsar\u0027s benevolent intentions, use violent\r\nmeasures to get rid of the opposition. The idea of agrarian massacres\r\nhad already taken possession of many timid minds. Besides this, all\r\nclasses of the proprietors felt that if the work was to be done, it\r\nshould be done by the Noblesse and not by the bureaucracy. If it were\r\neffected by the nobles the interests of the land-owners would be duly\r\nconsidered, but if it were effected by the Administration without their\r\nconcurrence and co-operation their interests would be neglected, and\r\nthere would inevitably be an enormous amount of jobbery and corruption.\r\nIn accordance with this view, the Noblesse corporations of the various\r\nprovinces successively requested permission to form committees for the\r\nconsideration of the question, and during the year 1858 a committee was\r\nopened in almost every province in which serfage existed.\r\n\r\nIn this way the question was apparently handed over for solution to the\r\nnobles, but in reality the Noblesse was called upon merely to advise,\r\nand not to legislate. The Government had not only laid down the\r\nfundamental principles of the scheme; it continually supervised the work\r\nof construction, and it reserved to itself the right of modifying or\r\nrejecting the projects proposed by the committees.\r\n\r\nAccording to these fundamental principles the serfs should be\r\nemancipated gradually, so that for some time they would remain attached\r\nto the glebe and subject to the authority of the proprietors. During\r\nthis transition period they should redeem by money payments or labour\r\ntheir houses and gardens, and enjoy in usufruct a certain quantity of\r\nland, sufficient to enable them to support themselves and to fulfil\r\ntheir obligations to the State as well as to the proprietor. In return\r\nfor this land they should pay a yearly rent in money, produce or labour\r\nover and above the yearly sum paid for the redemption of their\r\nhouses and gardens. As to what should be done after the expiry of the\r\ntransition period, the Government seems to have had no clearly conceived\r\nintentions. Probably it hoped that by that time the proprietors and\r\ntheir emancipated serfs would have invented some convenient modus\r\nvivendi, and that nothing but a little legislative regulation would be\r\nnecessary. But radical legislation is like the letting-out of water.\r\nThese fundamental principles, adopted at first with a view to\r\nmere immediate practical necessity, soon acquired a very different\r\nsignificance. To understand this we must return to the periodical\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nUntil the serf question came to be discussed, the reform aspirations\r\nwere very vague, and consequently there was a remarkable unanimity among\r\ntheir representatives. The great majority of the educated classes were\r\nunanimously of opinion that Russia should at once adopt from the West\r\nall those liberal principles and institutions the exclusion of which had\r\nprevented the country from rising to the level of the Western nations.\r\nBut very soon symptoms of a schism became apparent. Whilst the\r\nliterature in general was still preaching the doctrine that Russia\r\nshould adopt everything that was \"liberal,\" a few voices began to be\r\nheard warning the unwary that much which bore the name of liberal was\r\nin reality already antiquated and worthless--that Russia ought not to\r\nfollow blindly in the footsteps of other nations, but ought rather to\r\nprofit by their experience, and avoid the errors into which they had\r\nfallen. The chief of these errors was, according to these new teachers,\r\nthe abnormal development of individualism--the adoption of that\r\nprinciple of laissez faire which forms the basis of what may be\r\ncalled the Orthodox School of Political Economists. Individualism and\r\nunrestricted competition, it was said, have now reached in the West\r\nan abnormal and monstrous development. Supported by the laissez faire\r\nprinciple, they have led--and must always lead--to the oppression of the\r\nweak, the tyranny of capital, the impoverishment of the masses for\r\nthe benefit of the few, and the formation of a hungry, dangerous\r\nProletariat! This has already been recognised by the most advanced\r\nthinkers of France and Germany. If the older countries cannot at once\r\ncure those evils, that is no reason for Russia to inoculate herself with\r\nthem. She is still at the commencement of her career, and it would\r\nbe folly for her to wander voluntarily for ages in the Desert, when a\r\ndirect route to the Promised Land has been already discovered.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey some idea of the influence which this teaching\r\nexercised, I must here recall, at the risk of repeating myself, what\r\nI said in a former chapter. The Russians, as I have there pointed out,\r\nhave a peculiar way of treating political and social questions. Having\r\nreceived their political education from books, they naturally\r\nattribute to theoretical considerations an importance which seems to us\r\nexaggerated. When any important or trivial question arises, they at once\r\nlaunch into a sea of philosophical principles, and pay less attention to\r\nthe little objects close at hand than to the big ones that appear on\r\nthe distant horizon of the future. And when they set to work at\r\nany political reform they begin ab ovo. As they have no traditional\r\nprejudices to fetter them, and no traditional principles to lead\r\nthem, they naturally take for their guidance the latest conclusions of\r\npolitical philosophy.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, let us see how it affected the Emancipation\r\nquestion. The Proletariat--described as a dangerous monster which was\r\nabout to swallow up society in Western Europe, and which might at any\r\nmoment cross the frontier unless kept out by vigorous measures--took\r\npossession of the popular imagination, and aroused the fears of the\r\nreading public. To many it seemed that the best means of preventing the\r\nformation of a Proletariat in Russia was the securing of land for the\r\nemancipated serfs and the careful preservation of the rural Commune.\r\n\"Now is the moment,\" it was said, \"for deciding the important question\r\nwhether Russia is to fall a prey, like the Western nations, to this\r\nterrible evil, or whether she is to protect herself for ever against it.\r\nIn the decision of this question lies the future destiny of the country.\r\nIf the peasants be emancipated without land, or if those Communal\r\ninstitutions which give to every man a share of the soil and secure this\r\ninestimable boon for the generations still unborn be now abolished,\r\na Proletariat will be rapidly formed, and the peasantry will become a\r\ndisorganised mass of homeless wanderers like the English agricultural\r\nlabourers. If, on the contrary, a fair share of land be granted to them,\r\nand if the Commune be made proprietor of the land ceded, the danger of a\r\nProletariat is for ever removed, and Russia will thereby set an example\r\nto the civilised world! Never has a nation had such an opportunity of\r\nmaking an enormous leap forward on the road of progress, and never again\r\nwill the opportunity occur. The Western nations have discovered their\r\nerror when it is too late--when the peasantry have been already deprived\r\nof their land, and the labouring classes of the towns have already\r\nfallen a prey to the insatiable cupidity of the capitalists. In vain\r\ntheir most eminent thinkers warn and exhort. Ordinary remedies are no\r\nlonger of any avail. But Russia may avoid these dangers, if she but act\r\nwisely and prudently in this great matter. The peasants are still in\r\nactual, if not legal, possession of the land, and there is as yet\r\nno Proletariat in the towns. All that is necessary, therefore, is to\r\nabolish the arbitrary authority of the proprietors without expropriating\r\nthe peasants, and without disturbing the existing Communal institutions,\r\nwhich form the best barrier against pauperism.\"\r\n\r\nThese ideas were warmly espoused by many proprietors, and exercised a\r\nvery great influence on the deliberations of the Provincial Committees.\r\nIn these committees there were generally two groups. The majorities,\r\nwhilst making large concessions to the claims of justice and expediency,\r\nendeavoured to defend, as far as possible, the interests of their class;\r\nthe minorities, though by no means indifferent to the interests of the\r\nclass to which they belonged, allowed the more abstract theoretical\r\nconsiderations to be predominant. At first the majorities did all\r\nin their power to evade the fundamental principles laid down by the\r\nGovernment as much too favourable to the peasantry; but when they\r\nperceived that public opinion, as represented by the Press, went\r\nmuch further than the Government, they clung to these fundamental\r\nprinciples--which secured at least the fee simple of the estate to\r\nthe landlord--as their anchor of safety. Between the two parties arose\r\nnaturally a strong spirit of hostility, and the Government, which wished\r\nto have the support of the minorities, found it advisable that both\r\nshould present their projects for consideration.\r\n\r\nAs the Provincial Committees worked independently, there was\r\nconsiderable diversity in the conclusions at which they arrived. The\r\ntask of codifying these conclusions, and elaborating out of them a\r\ngeneral scheme of Emancipation, was entrusted to a special Imperial\r\nCommission, composed partly of officials and partly of landed\r\nproprietors named by the Emperor.* Those who believed that the question\r\nhad really been handed over to the Noblesse assumed that this Commission\r\nwould merely arrange the materials presented by the Provincial\r\nCommittees, and that the Emancipation Law would thereafter be elaborated\r\nby a National Assembly of deputies elected by the nobles. In reality\r\nthe Commission, working in St. Petersburg under the direct guidance\r\nand control of the Government, fulfilled a very different and much more\r\nimportant function. Using the combined projects merely as a storehouse\r\nfrom which it could draw the proposals it desired, it formed a new\r\nproject of its own, which ultimately received, after undergoing\r\nmodification in detail, the Imperial assent. Instead of being a mere\r\nchancellerie, as many expected, it became in a certain sense the author\r\nof the Emancipation Law.\r\n\r\n     * Known as the Redaktsionnaya Komissiya, or Elaboration\r\n     Commission. Strictly speaking, there were two, but they are\r\n     commonly spoken of as one.\r\n\r\nThere was, as we have seen, in nearly all the Provincial Committees\r\na majority and a minority, the former of which strove to defend the\r\ninterests of the proprietors, whilst the latter paid more attention to\r\ntheoretical considerations, and endeavoured to secure for the peasantry\r\na large amount of land and Communal self-government. In the Commission\r\nthere were the same two parties, but their relative strength was very\r\ndifferent. Here the men of theory, instead of forming a minority, were\r\nmore numerous than their opponents, and enjoyed the support of the\r\nGovernment, which regulated the proceedings. In its instructions we see\r\nhow much the question had ripened under the influence of the theoretical\r\nconsiderations. There is no longer any trace of the idea that the\r\nEmancipation should be gradual; on the contrary, it is expressly\r\ndeclared that the immediate effect of the law should be the complete\r\nabolition of the proprietor\u0027s authority. There is even evidence of a\r\nclear intention of preventing the proprietor as far as possible from\r\nexercising any influence over his former serfs. The sharp distinction\r\nbetween the land occupied by the village and the arable land to be ceded\r\nin usufruct likewise disappears, and it is merely said that efforts\r\nshould be made to enable the peasants to become proprietors of the land\r\nthey required.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Government had thus become clear and well defined. The\r\ntask to be performed was to transform the serfs at once, and with the\r\nleast possible disturbance of the existing economic conditions, into\r\na class of small Communal proprietors--that is to say, a class of free\r\npeasants possessing a house and garden and a share of the Communal land.\r\nTo effect this it was merely necessary to declare the serf personally\r\nfree, to draw a clear line of demarcation between the Communal land and\r\nthe rest of the estate, and to determine the price or rent which should\r\nbe paid for this Communal property, inclusive of the land on which the\r\nvillage was built.\r\n\r\nThe law was prepared in strict accordance with these principles. As\r\nto the amount of land to be ceded, it was decided that the existing\r\narrangements, founded on experience, should, as a general rule, be\r\npreserved--in other words, the land actually enjoyed by the peasants\r\nshould be retained by them; and in order to prevent extreme cases of\r\ninjustice, a maximum and a minimum were fixed for each district. In like\r\nmanner, as to the dues, it was decided that the existing arrangements\r\nshould be taken as the basis of the calculation, but that the sum should\r\nbe modified according to the amount of land ceded. At the same time\r\nfacilities were to be given for the transforming of the labour dues into\r\nyearly money payments, and for enabling the peasants to redeem them,\r\nwith the assistance of the Government, in the form of credit.\r\n\r\nThis idea of redemption created, at first, a feeling of alarm among the\r\nproprietors. It was bad enough to be obliged to cede a large part of the\r\nestates in usufruct, but it seemed to be much worse to have to sell it.\r\nRedemption appeared to be a species of wholesale confiscation. But very\r\nsoon it became evident that the redeeming of the land was profitable for\r\nboth parties. Cession in perpetual usufruct was felt to be in reality\r\ntantamount to alienation of the land, whilst the immediate redemption\r\nwould enable the proprietors, who had generally little or no ready money\r\nto pay their debts, to clear their estates from mortgages, and to make\r\nthe outlays necessary for the transition to free labour. The majority of\r\nthe proprietors, therefore, said openly: \"Let the Government give us a\r\nsuitable compensation in money for the land that is taken from us, so\r\nthat we may be at once freed from all further trouble and annoyance.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the Commission was not merely arranging and\r\ncodifying the materials, but elaborating a law of its own and regularly\r\nsubmitting its decisions for Imperial confirmation, a feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction appeared all over the country. The nobles perceived that\r\nthe question was being taken out of their hands, and was being solved\r\nby a small body composed of bureaucrats and nominees of the Government.\r\nAfter having made a voluntary sacrifice of their rights, they were being\r\nunceremoniously pushed aside. They had still, however, the means of\r\ncorrecting this. The Emperor had publicly promised that before the\r\nproject should become law deputies from the Provincial Committees should\r\nbe summoned to St. Petersburg to make objections and propose amendments.\r\n\r\nThe Commission and the Government would have willingly dispensed with\r\nall further advice from the nobles, but it was necessary to redeem the\r\nImperial promise. Deputies were therefore summoned to the capital, but\r\nthey were not allowed to form, as they hoped, a public assembly for\r\nthe discussion of the question. All their efforts to hold meetings were\r\nfrustrated, and they were required merely to answer in writing a list\r\nof printed questions regarding matters of detail. The fundamental\r\nprinciples, they were told, had already received the Imperial sanction,\r\nand were consequently removed from discussion. Those who desired to\r\ndiscuss details were invited individually to attend meetings of the\r\nCommission, where they found one or two members ready to engage with\r\nthem in a little dialectical fencing. This, of course, did not give much\r\nsatisfaction. Indeed, the ironical tone in which the fencing was too\r\noften conducted served to increase the existing irritation. It was only\r\ntoo evident that the Commission had triumphed, and some of the members\r\ncould justly boast that they had drowned the deputies in ink and buried\r\nthem under reams of paper.\r\n\r\nBelieving, or at least professing to believe, that the Emperor was\r\nbeing deceived in this matter by the Administration, several groups\r\nof deputies presented petitions to his Majesty containing a respectful\r\nprotest against the manner in which they had been treated. But by this\r\nact they simply laid themselves open to \"the most unkindest cut of all.\"\r\nThose who had signed the petitions received a formal reprimand through\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nThis treatment of the deputies, and, above all, this gratuitous insult,\r\nproduced among the nobles a storm of indignation. They felt that they\r\nhad been entrapped. The Government had artfully induced them to form\r\nprojects for the emancipation of their serfs, and now, after having been\r\nused as a cat\u0027s-paw in the work of their own spoliation, they were\r\nbeing unceremoniously pushed aside as no longer necessary. Those who\r\nhad indulged in the hope of gaining political rights felt the blow most\r\nkeenly. A first gentle and respectful attempt at remonstrance had been\r\nanswered by a dictatorial reprimand through the police! Instead of being\r\ncalled to take an active part in home and foreign politics, they\r\nwere being treated as naughty schoolboys. In view of this insult all\r\ndifferences of opinion were for the moment forgotten, and all parties\r\nresolved to join in a vigorous protest against the insolence and\r\narbitrary conduct of the bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nA convenient opportunity of making this protest in a legal way was\r\noffered by the triennial Provincial Assemblies of the Noblesse about to\r\nbe held in several provinces. So at least it was thought, but here again\r\nthe Noblesse was checkmated by the Administration.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of the Assemblies a circular was issued excluding the\r\nEmancipation question from their deliberations. Some Assemblies evaded\r\nthis order, and succeeded in making a little demonstration by submitting\r\nto his Majesty that the time had arrived for other reforms, such as the\r\nseparation of the administrative and judicial powers, and the creation\r\nof local self-government, public judicial procedure, and trial by jury.\r\n\r\nAll these reforms were voluntarily effected by the Emperor a few years\r\nlater, but the manner in which they were suggested seemed to savour of\r\ninsubordination, and was a flagrant infraction of the principle that all\r\ninitiative in public affairs should proceed from the central Government.\r\nNew measures of repression were accordingly used. Some Marshals of\r\nNoblesse were reprimanded and others deposed. Of the conspicuous\r\nleaders, two were exiled to distant provinces and others placed under\r\nthe supervision of the police. Worst of all, the whole agitation\r\nstrengthened the Commission by convincing the Emperor that the majority\r\nof the nobles were hostile to his benevolent plans.*\r\n\r\n     * This was a misinterpretation of the facts.  Very many of\r\n     those who joined in the protest sincerely sympathised with\r\n     the idea of Emancipation, and were ready to be even more\r\n     \"liberal\" than the Government.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commission had finished its labours, its proposals passed to\r\nthe two higher instances--the Committee for Peasant Affairs and the\r\nCouncil of State--and in both of these the Emperor declared plainly that\r\nhe could allow no fundamental changes. From all the members he demanded\r\na complete forgetfulness of former differences and a conscientious\r\nexecution of his orders; \"For you must remember,\" he significantly\r\nadded, \"that in Russia laws are made by the Autocratic Power.\" From\r\nan historical review of the question he drew the conclusion that \"the\r\nAutocratic Power created serfage, and the Autocratic Power ought to\r\nabolish it.\" On March 3d (February 19th, old style), 1861, the law\r\nwas signed, and by that act more than twenty millions of serfs were\r\nliberated.* A Manifesto containing the fundamental principles of the law\r\nwas at once sent all over the country, and an order was given that it\r\nshould be read in all the churches.\r\n\r\n     * It is sometimes said that forty millions of serfs have\r\n     been emancipated.  The statement is true, if we regard the\r\n     State peasants as serfs.  They held, as I have already\r\n     explained, an intermediate position between serfage and\r\n     freedom.  The peculiar administration under which they lived\r\n     was partly abolished by Imperial Orders of September 7th,\r\n     1859, and October 23d, 1861.  In 1866 they were placed, as\r\n     regards administration, on a level with the emancipated\r\n     serfs of the proprietors.  As a general rule, they received\r\n     rather more land and had to pay somewhat lighter dues than\r\n     the emancipated serfs in the narrower sense of the term.\r\n\r\nThe three fundamental principles laid down by the law were:--1. That the\r\nserfs should at once receive the civil rights of the free rural classes,\r\nand that the authority of the proprietor should be replaced by Communal\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n2. That the rural Communes should as far as possible retain the land\r\nthey actually held, and should in return pay to the proprietor certain\r\nyearly dues in money or labour.\r\n\r\n3. That the Government should by means of credit assist the Communes to\r\nredeem these dues, or, in other words, to purchase the lands ceded to\r\nthem in usufruct.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the domestic serfs, it was enacted that they should\r\ncontinue to serve their masters during two years, and that thereafter\r\nthey should be completely free, but they should have no claim to a share\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nIt might be reasonably supposed that the serfs received with boundless\r\ngratitude and delight the Manifesto proclaiming these principles. Here\r\nat last was the realisation of their long-cherished hopes. Liberty was\r\naccorded to them; and not only liberty, but a goodly portion of the\r\nsoil--about half of all the arable land possessed by the proprietors.\r\n\r\nIn reality the Manifesto created among the peasantry a feeling of\r\ndisappointment rather than delight. To understand this strange fact we\r\nmust endeavour to place ourselves at the peasant\u0027s point of view.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it must be remarked that all vague, rhetorical\r\nphrases about free labour, human dignity, national progress, and the\r\nlike, which may readily produce among educated men a certain amount of\r\ntemporary enthusiasm, fall on the ears of the Russian peasant like drops\r\nof rain on a granite rock. The fashionable rhetoric of philosophical\r\nliberalism is as incomprehensible to him as the flowery\r\ncircumlocutionary style of an Oriental scribe would be to a keen city\r\nmerchant. The idea of liberty in the abstract and the mention of rights\r\nwhich lie beyond the sphere of his ordinary everyday life awaken\r\nno enthusiasm in his breast. And for mere names he has a profound\r\nindifference. What matters it to him that he is officially called, not\r\na \"serf,\" but a \"free village-inhabitant,\" if the change in official\r\nterminology is not accompanied by some immediate material advantage?\r\nWhat he wants is a house to live in, food to eat, and raiment\r\nwherewithal to be clothed, and to gain these first necessaries of life\r\nwith as little labour as possible. He looked at the question exclusively\r\nfrom two points of view--that of historical right and that of material\r\nadvantage; and from both of these the Emancipation Law seemed to him\r\nvery unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of historical right the peasantry had their own\r\ntraditional conceptions, which were completely at variance with the\r\nwritten law. According to the positive legislation the Communal land\r\nformed part of the estate, and consequently belonged to the proprietor;\r\nbut according to the conceptions of the peasantry it belonged to the\r\nCommune, and the right of the proprietor consisted merely in that\r\npersonal authority over the serfs which had been conferred on him by the\r\nTsar. The peasants could not, of course, put these conceptions into a\r\nstrict legal form, but they often expressed them in their own homely\r\nlaconic way by saying to their master, \"Mui vashi no zemlya nasha\"--that\r\nis to say. \"We are yours, but the land is ours.\" And it must be admitted\r\nthat this view, though legally untenable, had a certain historical\r\njustification.*\r\n\r\n     * See preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nIn olden times the Noblesse had held their land by feudal tenure,\r\nand were liable to be ejected as soon as they did not fulfil their\r\nobligations to the State. These obligations had been long since\r\nabolished, and the feudal tenure transformed into an unconditional\r\nright of property, but the peasants clung to the old ideas in a way that\r\nstrikingly illustrates the vitality of deep-rooted popular conceptions.\r\nIn their minds the proprietors were merely temporary occupants, who were\r\nallowed by the Tsar to exact labour and dues from the serfs. What, then,\r\nwas Emancipation? Certainly the abolition of all obligatory labour and\r\nmoney dues, and perhaps the complete ejectment of the proprietors. On\r\nthis latter point there was a difference of opinion. All assumed, as a\r\nmatter of course, that the Communal land would remain the property of\r\nthe Commune, but it was not so clear what would be done with the rest\r\nof the estate. Some thought that it would be retained by the proprietor,\r\nbut very many believed that all the land would be given to the Communes.\r\nIn this way the Emancipation would be in accordance with historical\r\nright and with the material advantage of the peasantry, for whose\r\nexclusive benefit, it was assumed, the reform had been undertaken.\r\n\r\nInstead of this the peasants found that they were still to pay dues,\r\neven for the Communal land which they regarded as unquestionably their\r\nown. So at least said the expounders of the law. But the thing was\r\nincredible. Either the proprietors must be concealing or misinterpreting\r\nthe law, or this was merely a preparatory measure, which would be\r\nfollowed by the real Emancipation. Thus were awakened among the\r\npeasantry a spirit of mistrust and suspicion and a widespread belief\r\nthat there would be a second Imperial Manifesto, by which all the land\r\nwould be divided and all the dues abolished.\r\n\r\nOn the nobles the Manifesto made a very different impression. The\r\nfact that they were to be entrusted with the putting of the law into\r\nexecution, and the flattering allusions made to the spirit of generous\r\nself-sacrifice which they had exhibited, kindled amongst them enthusiasm\r\nenough to make them forget for a time their just grievances and their\r\nhostility towards the bureaucracy. They found that the conditions on\r\nwhich the Emancipation was effected were by no means so ruinous as\r\nthey had anticipated; and the Emperor\u0027s appeal to their generosity\r\nand patriotism made many of them throw themselves with ardour into the\r\nimportant task confided to them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately they could not at once begin the work. The law had been\r\nso hurried through the last stages that the preparations for putting\r\nit into execution were by no means complete when the Manifesto was\r\npublished. The task of regulating the future relations between the\r\nproprietors and the peasantry was entrusted to local proprietors in\r\neach district, who were to be called Arbiters of the Peace (Mirovuiye\r\nPosredniki); but three months elapsed before these Arbiters could be\r\nappointed. During that time there was no one to explain the law to the\r\npeasants and settle the disputes between them and the proprietors;\r\nand the consequence of this was that many cases of insubordination and\r\ndisorder occurred. The muzhik naturally imagined that, as soon as the\r\nTsar said he was free, he was no longer obliged to work for his old\r\nmaster--that all obligatory labour ceased as soon as the Manifesto was\r\nread. In vain the proprietor endeavoured to convince him that, in regard\r\nto labour, the old relations must continue, as the law enjoined, until\r\na new arrangement had been made. To all explanations and exhortations he\r\nturned a deaf ear, and to the efforts of the rural police he too often\r\nopposed a dogged, passive resistance.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the simple appearance of the higher authorities sufficed\r\nto restore order, for the presence of one of the Tsar\u0027s servants\r\nconvinced many that the order to work for the present as formerly was\r\nnot a mere invention of the proprietors. But not infrequently the birch\r\nhad to be applied. Indeed, I am inclined to believe, from the numerous\r\ndescriptions of this time which I received from eye-witnesses, that\r\nrarely, if ever, had the serfs seen and experienced so much flogging as\r\nduring these first three months after their liberation. Sometimes even\r\nthe troops had to be called out, and on three occasions they fired on\r\nthe peasants with ball cartridge. In the most serious case, where\r\na young peasant had set up for a prophet and declared that the\r\nEmancipation Law was a forgery, fifty-one peasants were killed and\r\nseventy-seven were more or less seriously wounded. In spite of these\r\nlamentable incidents, there was nothing which even the most violent\r\nalarmist could dignify with the name of an insurrection. Nowhere was\r\nthere anything that could be called organised resistance. Even in the\r\ncase above alluded to, the three thousand peasants on whom the troops\r\nfired were entirely unarmed, made no attempt to resist, and dispersed\r\nin the utmost haste as soon as they discovered that they were being shot\r\ndown. Had the military authorities shown a little more judgment, tact,\r\nand patience, the history of the Emancipation would not have been\r\nstained even with those three solitary cases of unnecessary bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThis interregnum between the eras of serfage and liberty was brought to\r\nan end by the appointment of the Arbiters of the Peace. Their first duty\r\nwas to explain the law, and to organise the new peasant self-government.\r\nThe lowest instance, or primary organ of this self-government, the rural\r\nCommune, already existed, and at once recovered much of its ancient\r\nvitality as soon as the authority and interference of the proprietors\r\nwere removed. The second instance, the Volost--a territorial\r\nadministrative unit comprising several contiguous Communes--had to be\r\ncreated, for nothing of the kind had previously existed on the estates\r\nof the nobles. It had existed, however, for nearly a quarter of\r\na century among the peasants of the Domains, and it was therefore\r\nnecessary merely to copy an existing model.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all the Volosts in his district had been thus organised the\r\nArbiter had to undertake the much more arduous task of regulating the\r\nagrarian relations between the proprietors and the Communes--with the\r\nindividual peasants, be it remembered, the proprietors had no direct\r\nrelations whatever. It had been enacted by the law that the future\r\nagrarian relations between the two parties should be left, as far as\r\npossible, to voluntary contract; and accordingly each proprietor was\r\ninvited to come to an agreement with the Commune or Communes on his\r\nestate. On the ground of this agreement a statute-charter (ustavnaya\r\ngramota) was prepared, specifying the number of male serfs, the quantity\r\nof land actually enjoyed by them, any proposed changes in this amount,\r\nthe dues proposed to be levied, and other details. If the Arbiter\r\nfound that the conditions were in accordance with the law and\r\nclearly understood by the peasants, he confirmed the charter, and the\r\narrangement was complete. When the two parties could not come to an\r\nagreement within a year, he prepared a charter according to his own\r\njudgment, and presented it for confirmation to the higher authorities.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of partnership, if it be allowable to use such a\r\nterm, between the proprietor and his serfs was sometimes very easy and\r\nsometimes very difficult. On many estates the charter did little more\r\nthan legalise the existing arrangements, but in many instances it was\r\nnecessary to add to, or subtract from, the amount of Communal land, and\r\nsometimes it was even necessary to remove the village to another part\r\nof the estate. In all cases there were, of course, conflicting interests\r\nand complicated questions, so that the Arbiter had always abundance\r\nof difficult work. Besides this, he had to act as mediator in those\r\ndifferences which naturally arose during the transition period, when the\r\nauthority of the proprietor had been abolished but the separation of\r\nthe two classes had not yet been effected. The unlimited patriarchal\r\nauthority which had been formerly wielded by the proprietor or his\r\nsteward now passed with certain restriction into the hands of the\r\nArbiter, and these peacemakers had to spend a great part of their time\r\nin driving about from one estate to another to put an end to alleged\r\ncases of insubordination--some of which, it must be admitted, existed\r\nonly in the imagination of the proprietors.\r\n\r\nAt first the work of amicable settlement proceeded slowly. The\r\nproprietors generally showed a conciliatory spirit, and some of them\r\ngenerously proposed conditions much more favourable to the peasants than\r\nthe law demanded; but the peasants were filled with vague suspicions,\r\nand feared to commit themselves by \"putting pen to paper.\" Even the\r\nhighly respected proprietors, who imagined that they possessed the\r\nunbounded confidence of the peasantry, were suspected like the others,\r\nand their generous offers were regarded as well-baited traps. Often I\r\nhave heard old men, sometimes with tears in their eyes, describe the\r\ndistrust and ingratitude of the muzhik at this time. Many peasants still\r\nbelieved that the proprietors were hiding the real Emancipation Law,\r\nand imaginative or ill-intentioned persons fostered this belief by\r\nprofessing to know what the real law contained. The most absurd rumours\r\nwere afloat, and whole villages sometimes acted upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Moscow, for instance, one Commune sent a deputation\r\nto the proprietor to inform him that, as he had always been a good\r\nmaster, the Mir would allow him to retain his house and garden during\r\nhis lifetime. In another locality it was rumoured that the Tsar sat\r\ndaily on a golden throne in the Crimea, receiving all peasants who came\r\nto him, and giving them as much land as they desired; and in order to\r\ntake advantage of the Imperial liberality a large body of peasants set\r\nout for the place indicated, and had to be stopped by the military.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the illusions in which the peasantry indulged at\r\nthis time, I may mention here one of the many characteristic incidents\r\nrelated to me by gentlemen who had served as Arbiters of the Peace.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Riazan there was one Commune which had acquired a\r\ncertain local notoriety for the obstinacy with which it refused all\r\narrangements with the proprietor. My informant, who was Arbiter for the\r\nlocality, was at last obliged to make a statute-charter for it without\r\nits consent. He wished, however, that the peasants should voluntarily\r\naccept the arrangement he proposed, and accordingly called them together\r\nto talk with them on the subject. After explaining fully the part of the\r\nlaw which related to their case, he asked them what objection they had\r\nto make a fair contract with their old master. For some time he received\r\nno answer, but gradually by questioning individuals he discovered the\r\ncause of their obstinacy: they were firmly convinced that not only the\r\nCommunal land, but also the rest of the estate, belonged to them. To\r\neradicate this false idea he set himself to reason with them, and the\r\nfollowing characteristic dialogue ensued:--Arbiter: \"If the Tsar gave\r\nall the land to the peasantry, what compensation could he give to the\r\nproprietors to whom the land belongs?\"\r\n\r\nPeasant: \"The Tsar will give them salaries according to their service.\"\r\n\r\nArbiter: \"In order to pay these salaries he would require a great deal\r\nmore money. Where could he get that money? He would have to increase the\r\ntaxes, and in that way you would have to pay all the same.\"\r\n\r\nPeasant: \"The Tsar can make as much money as he likes.\"\r\n\r\nArbiter: \"If the Tsar can make as much money as he likes, why does he\r\nmake you pay the poll-tax every year?\"\r\n\r\nPeasant: \"It is not the Tsar that receives the taxes we pay.\"\r\n\r\nArbiter: \"Who, then, receives them?\"\r\n\r\nPeasant (after a little hesitation, and with a knowing smite): \"The\r\nofficials, of course!\"\r\n\r\nGradually, through the efforts of the Arbiters, the peasants came to\r\nknow better their real position, and the work began to advance more\r\nrapidly. But soon it was checked by another influence. By the end of the\r\nfirst year the \"liberal,\" patriotic enthusiasm of the nobles had cooled.\r\nThe sentimental, idyllic tendencies had melted away at the first touch\r\nof reality, and those who had imagined that liberty would have an\r\nimmediately salutary effect on the moral character of the serfs\r\nconfessed themselves disappointed. Many complained that the peasants\r\nshowed themselves greedy and obstinate, stole wood from the forest,\r\nallowed their cattle to wander on the proprietor\u0027s fields, failed to\r\nfulfil their legal obligations, and broke their voluntary engagements.\r\nAt the same time the fears of an agrarian rising subsided, so that even\r\nthe timid were tranquillised. From these causes the conciliatory spirit\r\nof the proprietors decreased.\r\n\r\nThe work of conciliating and regulating became consequently more\r\ndifficult, but the great majority of the Arbiters showed themselves\r\nequal to the task, and displayed an impartiality, tact and patience\r\nbeyond all praise. To them Russia is in great part indebted for the\r\npeaceful character of the Emancipation. Had they sacrificed the general\r\ngood to the interests of their class, or had they habitually acted in\r\nthat stern, administrative, military spirit which caused the instances\r\nof bloodshed above referred to, the prophecies of the alarmists would,\r\nin all probability, have been realised, and the historian of the\r\nEmancipation would have had a terrible list of judicial massacres to\r\nrecord. Fortunately they played the part of mediators, as their name\r\nsignified, rather than that of administrators in the bureaucratic sense\r\nof the term, and they were animated with a just and humane rather than a\r\nmerely legal spirit. Instead of simply laying down the law, and ordering\r\ntheir decisions to be immediately executed, they were ever ready to\r\nspend hours in trying to conquer, by patient and laborious reasoning,\r\nthe unjust claims of proprietors or the false conceptions and ignorant\r\nobstinacy of the peasants. It was a new spectacle for Russia to see a\r\npublic function fulfilled by conscientious men who had their heart in\r\ntheir work, who sought neither promotion nor decorations, and who paid\r\nless attention to the punctilious observance of prescribed formalities\r\nthan to the real objects in view.\r\n\r\nThere were, it is true, a few men to whom this description does not\r\napply. Some of these were unduly under the influence of the feelings\r\nand conceptions created by serfage. Some, on the contrary, erred on the\r\nother side. Desirous of securing the future welfare of the peasantry and\r\nof gaining for themselves a certain kind of popularity, and at the same\r\ntime animated with a violent spirit of pseudo-liberalism, these latter\r\noccasionally forgot that their duty was to be, not generous, but just,\r\nand that they had no right to practise generosity at other people\u0027s\r\nexpense. All this I am quite aware of--I could even name one or two\r\nArbiters who were guilty of positive dishonesty--but I hold that these\r\nwere rare exceptions. The great majority did their duty faithfully and\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe work of concluding contracts for the redemption of the dues, or, in\r\nother words, for the purchase of the land ceded in perpetual usufruct,\r\nproceeded slowly. The arrangement was as follows:--The dues were\r\ncapitalised at six per cent., and the Government paid at once to the\r\nproprietors four-fifths of the whole sum. The peasants were to pay to\r\nthe proprietor the remaining fifth, either at once or in installments,\r\nand to the Government six per cent. for forty-nine years on the sum\r\nadvanced. The proprietors willingly adopted this arrangement, for\r\nit provided them with a sum of ready money, and freed them from the\r\ndifficult task of collecting the dues. But the peasants did not show\r\nmuch desire to undertake the operation. Some of them still expected a\r\nsecond Emancipation, and those who did not take this possibility into\r\ntheir calculations were little disposed to make present sacrifices for\r\ndistant prospective advantages which would not be realised for half a\r\ncentury. In most cases the proprietor was obliged to remit, in whole or\r\nin part, the fifth to be paid by the peasants. Many Communes refused to\r\nundertake the operation on any conditions and in consequence of this\r\nnot a few proprietors demanded the so-called obligatory redemption,\r\naccording to which they accepted the four-fifths from the Government as\r\nfull payment, and the operation was thus effected without the peasants\r\nbeing consulted. The total number of male serfs emancipated was about\r\nnine millions and three-quarters,* and of these, only about seven\r\nmillions and a quarter had, at the beginning of 1875, made redemption\r\ncontracts. Of the contracts signed at that time, about sixty-three per\r\ncent, were \"obligatory.\" In 1887 the redemption was made obligatory\r\nfor both parties, so that all Communes are now proprietors of the land\r\npreviously held in perpetual usufruct; and in 1932 the debt will have\r\nbeen extinguished by the sinking fund, and all redemption payments will\r\nhave ceased.\r\n\r\n     * This does not include the domestic serfs who did not\r\n     receive land.\r\n\r\nThe serfs were thus not only liberated, but also made possessors of\r\nland and put on the road to becoming Communal proprietors, and the old\r\nCommunal institutions were preserved and developed. In answer to the\r\nquestion, Who effected this gigantic reform? we may say that the chief\r\nmerit undoubtedly belongs to Alexander II. Had he not possessed a very\r\ngreat amount of courage he would neither have raised the question nor\r\nallowed it to be raised by others, and had he not shown a great deal\r\nmore decision and energy than was expected, the solution would have been\r\nindefinitely postponed. Among the members of his own family he found an\r\nable and energetic assistant in his brother, the Grand Duke Constantine,\r\nand a warm sympathiser with the cause in the Grand Duchess Helena,\r\na German Princess thoroughly devoted to the welfare of her adopted\r\ncountry. But we must not overlook the important part played by the\r\nnobles. Their conduct was very characteristic. As soon as the question\r\nwas raised a large number of them adopted the liberal ideas with\r\nenthusiasm; and as soon as it became evident that Emancipation was\r\ninevitable, all made a holocaust of their ancient rights and demanded to\r\nbe liberated at once from all relations with their serfs. Moreover, when\r\nthe law was passed it was the proprietors who faithfully put it\r\ninto execution. Lastly, we should remember that praise is due to the\r\npeasantry for their patience under disappointment and for their orderly\r\nconduct as soon as they understood the law and recognised it to be the\r\nwill of the Tsar. Thus it may justly be said that the Emancipation was\r\nnot the work of one man, or one party, or one class, but of the nation\r\nas a whole.*\r\n\r\n     * The names most commonly associated with the Emancipation\r\n     are General Rostoftsef, Lanskoi (Minister of the Interior),\r\n     Nicholas Milutin, Prince Tchererkassky, G. Samarin,\r\n     Koshelef.  Many others, such as I. A. Solovief, Zhukofski,\r\n     Domontovitch, Giers--brother of M. Giers, afterwards\r\n     Minister for Foreign Affairs--are less known, but did\r\n     valuable work.  To all of these, with the exception of the\r\n     first two, who died before my arrival in Russia, I have to\r\n     confess my obligations.  The late Nicholas Milutin rendered\r\n     me special service by putting at my disposal not only all\r\n     the official papers in his possession, but also many\r\n     documents of a more private kind. By his early and lamented\r\n     death Russia lost one of the greatest statesmen she has yet\r\n     produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE LANDED PROPRIETORS SINCE THE EMANCIPATION\r\n\r\nTwo Opposite Opinions--Difficulties of Investigation--The Problem\r\nSimplified--Direct and Indirect Compensation--The Direct Compensation\r\nInadequate--What the Proprietors Have Done with the Remainder of\r\nTheir Estates--Immediate Moral Effect of the Abolition of Serfage--The\r\nEconomic Problem--The Ideal Solution and the Difficulty of Realising\r\nIt--More Primitive Arrangements--The Northern Agricultural Zone--The\r\nBlack-earth Zone--The Labour Difficulty--The Impoverishment of\r\nthe Noblesse Not a New Phenomenon--Mortgaging of Estates--Gradual\r\nExpropriation of the Noblesse-Rapid Increase in the Production and\r\nExport of Grain--How Far this Has Benefited the Landed Proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Emancipation question was raised there was a considerable\r\ndiversity of opinion as to the effect which the abolition of serfage\r\nwould have on the material interests of the two classes directly\r\nconcerned. The Press and \"the young generation\" took an optimistic view,\r\nand endeavoured to prove that the proposed change would be beneficial\r\nalike to proprietors and to peasants. Science, it was said, has long\r\nsince decided that free labour is immensely more productive than slavery\r\nor serfage, and the principle has been already proved to demonstration\r\nin the countries of Western Europe. In all those countries modern\r\nagricultural progress began with the emancipation of the serfs,\r\nand increased productivity was everywhere the immediate result of\r\nimprovements in the method of culture. Thus the poor light soils of\r\nGermany, France, and Holland have been made to produce more than the\r\nvaunted \"black earth\" of Russia. And from these ameliorations the\r\nland-owning class has everywhere derived the chief advantages. Are not\r\nthe landed proprietors of England--the country in which serfage was\r\nfirst abolished--the richest in the world? And is not the proprietor of\r\na few hundred morgen in Germany often richer than the Russian noble who\r\nhas thousands of dessyatins? By these and similar plausible arguments\r\nthe Press endeavoured to prove to the proprietors that they ought, even\r\nin their own interest, to undertake the emancipation of the serfs. Many\r\nproprietors, however, showed little faith in the abstract principles of\r\npolitical economy and the vague teachings of history as interpreted by\r\nthe contemporary periodical literature. They could not always refute the\r\ningenious arguments adduced by the men of more sanguine temperament, but\r\nthey felt convinced that their prospects were not nearly so bright\r\nas these men represented them to be. They believed that Russia was a\r\npeculiar country, and the Russians a peculiar people. The lower classes\r\nin England, France, Holland, and Germany were well known to be laborious\r\nand enterprising, while the Russian peasant was notoriously lazy,\r\nand would certainly, if left to himself, not do more work than was\r\nabsolutely necessary to keep him from starving. Free labour might\r\nbe more profitable than serfage in countries where the upper classes\r\npossessed traditional practical knowledge and abundance of capital, but\r\nin Russia the proprietors had neither the practical knowledge nor the\r\nready money necessary to make the proposed ameliorations in the system\r\nof agriculture. To all this it was added that a system of emancipation\r\nby which the peasants should receive land and be made completely\r\nindependent of the landed proprietors had nowhere been tried on such a\r\nlarge scale.\r\n\r\nThere were thus two diametrically opposite opinions regarding the\r\neconomic results of the abolition of serfage, and we have now to examine\r\nwhich of these two opinions has been confirmed by experience.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the question first from the point of view of the\r\nland-owners.\r\n\r\nThe reader who has never attempted to make investigations of this kind\r\nmay naturally imagine that the question can be easily decided by simply\r\nconsulting a large number of individual proprietors, and drawing a\r\ngeneral conclusion from their evidence. In reality I found the task\r\nmuch more difficult. After roaming about the country for five years\r\n(1870-75), collecting information from the best available sources, I\r\nhesitated to draw any sweeping conclusions, and my state of mind at that\r\ntime was naturally reflected in the early editions of this work. As a\r\nrule the proprietors could not state clearly how much they had lost or\r\ngained, and when definite information was obtained from them it was not\r\nalways trustworthy. In the time of serfage very few of them had been\r\nin the habit of keeping accurate accounts, or accounts of any kind, and\r\nwhen they lived on their estates there were a very large number of\r\nitems which could not possibly be reduced to figures. Of course, each\r\nproprietor had a general idea as to whether his position was better or\r\nworse than it had been in the old times, but the vague statements made\r\nby individuals regarding their former and their actual revenues had\r\nlittle or no scientific value. So many considerations which had nothing\r\nto do with purely agrarian relations entered into the calculations that\r\nthe conclusions did not help me much to estimate the economic results\r\nof the Emancipation as a whole. Nor, it must be confessed, was the\r\ntestimony by any means always unbiassed. Not a few spoke of the\r\ngreat reform in an epic or dithyrambic tone, and among these I easily\r\ndistinguished two categories: the one desired to prove that the measure\r\nwas a complete success in every way, and that all classes were benefited\r\nby it, not only morally, but also materially; whilst the others strove\r\nto represent the proprietors in general, and themselves in particular,\r\nas the self-sacrificing victims of a great and necessary patriotic\r\nreform--as martyrs in the cause of liberty and progress. I do not for\r\na moment suppose that these two groups of witnesses had a clearly\r\nconceived intention of deceiving or misleading, but as a cautious\r\ninvestigator I had to make allowance for their idealising and\r\nsentimental tendencies.\r\n\r\nSince that time the situation has become much clearer, and during\r\nrecent visits to Russia I have been able to arrive at much more definite\r\nconclusions. These I now proceed to communicate to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation caused the proprietors of all classes to pass through\r\na severe economic crisis. Periods of transition always involve much\r\nsuffering, and the amount of suffering is generally in the inverse ratio\r\nof the precautions taken beforehand. In Russia the precautions had\r\nbeen neglected. Not one proprietor in a hundred had made any serious\r\npreparations for the inevitable change. On the eve of the Emancipation\r\nthere were about ten millions of male serfs on private properties, and\r\nof these nearly seven millions remained under the old system of paying\r\ntheir dues in labour. Of course, everybody knew that Emancipation must\r\ncome sooner or later, but fore-thought, prudence, and readiness to take\r\ntime by the forelock are not among the prominent traits of the Russian\r\ncharacter. Hence most of the land-owners were taken unawares. But while\r\nall suffered, there were differences of degree. Some were completely\r\nshipwrecked. So long as serfage existed all the relations of life were\r\nill-defined and extremely elastic, so that a man who was hopelessly\r\ninsolvent might contrive, with very little effort, to keep his head\r\nabove water for half a lifetime. For such men the Emancipation, like a\r\ncrisis in the commercial world, brought a day of reckoning. It did not\r\nreally ruin them, but it showed them and the world at large that they\r\nwere ruined, and they could no longer continue their old mode of life.\r\nFor others the crisis was merely temporary. These emerged with a larger\r\nincome than they ever had before, but I am not prepared to say that\r\ntheir material condition has improved, because the social habits have\r\nchanged, the cost of living has become much greater, and the work of\r\nadministering estates is incomparably more complicated and laborious\r\nthan in the old patriarchal times.\r\n\r\nWe may greatly simplify the problem by reducing it to two definite\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n1. How far were the proprietors directly indemnified for the loss of\r\nserf labour and for the transfer in perpetual usufruct of a large part\r\nof their estates to the peasantry?\r\n\r\n2. What have the proprietors done with the remainder of their estates,\r\nand how far have they been indirectly indemnified by the economic\r\nchanges which have taken place since the Emancipation?\r\n\r\nWith the first of these questions I shall deal very briefly, because it\r\nis a controversial subject involving very complicated calculations\r\nwhich only a specialist can understand. The conclusion at which I have\r\narrived, after much patient research, is that in most provinces the\r\ncompensation was inadequate, and this conclusion is confirmed by\r\nexcellent native authorities. M. Bekhteyev, for example, one of the most\r\nlaborious and conscientious investigators in this field of research,\r\nand the author of an admirable work on the economic results of the\r\nEmancipation,* told me recently, in course of conversation, that in\r\nhis opinion the peasant dues fixed by the Emancipation Law represented,\r\nthroughout the Black-earth Zone, only about a half of the value of the\r\nlabour previously supplied by the serfs. To this I must add that the\r\ncompensation was in reality not nearly so great as it seemed to be\r\naccording to the terms of the law. As the proprietors found it extremely\r\ndifficult to collect the dues from the emancipated serfs, and as they\r\nrequired a certain amount of capital to reorganise the estate on the new\r\nbasis of free labour, most of them were practically compelled to demand\r\nthe obligatory redemption of the land (obiazatelny vuikup), and in\r\nadopting this expedient they had to make considerable sacrifices. Not\r\nonly had they to accept as full payment four-fifths of the normal sum,\r\nbut of this amount the greater portion was paid in Treasury bonds, which\r\nfell at once to 80 per cent. of their nominal value.\r\n\r\n     * \"Khozaistvenniye Itogi istekshago Sorokoletiya.\" St.\r\n     Petersburg, 1902.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass to the second part of the problem: What have the\r\nproprietors done with the part of their estates which remained to them\r\nafter ceding the required amount of land to the Communes? Have they\r\nbeen indirectly indemnified for the loss of serf labour by subsequent\r\neconomic changes? How far have they succeeded in making the transition\r\nfrom serfage to free labour, and what revenues do they now derive from\r\ntheir estates? The answer to these questions will necessarily contain\r\nsome account of the present economic position of the proprietors.\r\n\r\nOn all proprietors the Emancipation had at least one good effect: it\r\ndragged them forcibly from the old path of indolence and routine and\r\ncompelled them to think and calculate regarding their affairs. The\r\nhereditary listlessness and apathy, the traditional habit of looking on\r\nthe estate with its serfs as a kind of self-acting machine which must\r\nalways spontaneously supply the owner with the means of living, the\r\ninveterate practice of spending all ready money and of taking little\r\nheed for the morrow--all this, with much that resulted from it, was\r\nrudely swept away and became a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe broad, easy road on which the proprietors had hitherto let\r\nthemselves be borne along by the force of circumstances suddenly split\r\nup into a number of narrow, arduous, thorny paths. Each one had to use\r\nhis judgement to determine which of the paths he should adopt, and,\r\nhaving made his choice, he had to struggle along as he best could. I\r\nremember once asking a proprietor what effect the Emancipation had had\r\non the class to which he belonged, and he gave me an answer which is\r\nworth recording. \"Formerly,\" he said, \"we kept no accounts and drank\r\nchampagne; now we keep accounts and content ourselves with kvass.\"\r\nLike all epigrammatic sayings, this laconic reply is far from giving\r\na complete description of reality, but it indicates in a graphic way\r\na change that has unquestionably taken place. As soon as serfage was\r\nabolished it was no longer possible to live like \"the flowers of the\r\nfield.\" Many a proprietor who had formerly vegetated in apathetic ease\r\nhad to ask himself the question: How am I to gain a living? All had to\r\nconsider what was the most profitable way of employing the land that\r\nremained to them.\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution of the problem was that as soon as the peasant-land\r\nhad been demarcated, the proprietor should take to farming the remainder\r\nof his estate by means of hired labour and agricultural machines in West\r\nEuropean or American fashion. Unfortunately, this solution could not\r\nbe generally adopted, because the great majority of the landlords, even\r\nwhen they had the requisite practical knowledge of agriculture, had not\r\nthe requisite capital, and could not easily obtain it. Where were they\r\nto find money for buying cattle, horses, and agricultural implements,\r\nfor building stables and cattle-sheds, and for defraying all the other\r\ninitial expenses? And supposing they succeeded in starting the new\r\nsystem, where was the working capital to come from? The old Government\r\ninstitution in which estates could be mortgaged according to the number\r\nof serfs was permanently closed, and the new land-credit associations\r\nhad not yet come into existence. To borrow from private capitalists was\r\nnot to be thought of, for money was so scarce than ten per cent. was\r\nconsidered a \"friendly\" rate of interest. Recourse might be had, it is\r\ntrue, to the redemption operation, but in that case the Government would\r\ndeduct the unpaid portion of any outstanding mortgage, and would pay\r\nthe balance in depreciated Treasury bonds. In these circumstances the\r\nproprietors could not, as a rule, adopt what I have called the ideal\r\nsolution, and had to content themselves with some simpler and\r\nmore primitive arrangement. They could employ the peasants of the\r\nneighbouring villages to prepare the land and reap the crops either for\r\na fixed sum per acre or on the metayage system, or they could let their\r\nland to the peasants for one, three or six years at a moderate rent.\r\n\r\nIn the northern agricultural zone, where the soil is poor and primitive\r\nfarming with free labour can hardly be made to pay, the proprietors had\r\nto let their land at a small rent, and those of them who could not find\r\nplaces in the rural administration migrated to the towns and sought\r\nemployment in the public service or in the numerous commercial and\r\nindustrial enterprises which were springing up at that time. There they\r\nhave since remained. Their country-houses, if inhabited at all, are\r\noccupied only for a few months in summer, and too often present a\r\nmelancholy spectacle of neglect and dilapidation. In the Black-earth\r\nZone, on the contrary, where the soil still possesses enough of its\r\nnatural fertility to make farming on a large scale profitable, the\r\nestates are in a very different condition. The owners cultivate at least\r\na part of their property, and can easily let to the peasants at a fair\r\nrent the land which they do not wish to farm themselves. Some have\r\nadopted the metayage system; others get the field-work done by the\r\npeasants at so much per acre. The more energetic, who have capital\r\nenough at their disposal, organise farms with hired labourers on the\r\nEuropean model. If they are not so well off as formerly, it is because\r\nthey have adopted a less patriarchal and more expensive style of living.\r\nTheir land has doubled and trebled in value during the last thirty\r\nyears, and their revenues have increased, if not in proportion, at least\r\nconsiderably. In 1903 I visited a number of estates in this region and\r\nfound them in a very prosperous condition, with agricultural machines of\r\nthe English or American types, an increasing variety in the rotation of\r\ncrops, greatly improved breeds of cattle and horses, and all the other\r\nsymptoms of a gradual transition to a more intensive and more rational\r\nsystem of agriculture.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that even in the Black-earth Zone the\r\nproprietors have formidable difficulties to contend with, the chief of\r\nwhich are the scarcity of good farm-labourers, the frequent droughts,\r\nthe low price of cereals, and the delay in getting the grain conveyed to\r\nthe seaports. On each of these difficulties and the remedies that might\r\nbe applied I could write a separate chapter, but I fear to overtax the\r\nreader\u0027s patience, and shall therefore confine myself to a few remarks\r\nabout the labour question. On this subject the complaints are loud and\r\nfrequent all over the country. The peasants, it is said, have become\r\nlazy, careless, addicted to drunkenness, and shamelessly dishonest with\r\nregard to their obligations, so that it is difficult to farm even in the\r\nold primitive fashion and impossible to introduce radical improvements\r\nin the methods of culture. In these sweeping accusations there is a\r\ncertain amount of truth. That the muzhik, when working for others,\r\nexerts himself as little as possible; that he pays little attention to\r\nthe quality of the work done; that he shows a reckless carelessness with\r\nregard to his employer\u0027s property; that he is capable of taking money\r\nin advance and failing to fulfil his contract; that he occasionally gets\r\ndrunk; and that he is apt to commit certain acts of petty larceny when\r\nhe gets the chance--all this is undoubtedly true, whatever biassed\r\ntheorists and sentimental peasant-worshippers may say to the contrary.*\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the fault is entirely\r\non the side of the peasants, and equally erroneous to believe that the\r\nevils might be remedied, as is often suggested, by greater severity\r\non the part of the tribunals, or by an improved system of passports.\r\nFarming with free labour, like every other department of human activity,\r\nrequires a fair amount of knowledge, judgment, prudence, and tact, which\r\ncannot be replaced by ingenious legislation or judicial severity. In\r\nengaging labourers or servants it is necessary to select them carefully\r\nand make such conditions that they feel it to be to their interest\r\nto fulfil their contract loyally. This is too often overlooked by the\r\nRussian land-owners. From false views of economy they are inclined\r\nto choose the cheapest labourer without examining closely his other\r\nqualifications, or they take advantage of the peasant\u0027s pecuniary\r\nembarrassments and make with him a contract which it is hardly possible\r\nfor him to fulfil. In spring, for instance, when his store of provisions\r\nis exhausted and he is being hard pressed by the tax-collector,\r\nthey supply him with rye-meal or advance him a small sum of money on\r\ncondition of his undertaking to do a relatively large amount of summer\r\nwork. He knows that the contract is unfair to him, but what is he to do?\r\nHe must get food for himself and his family and a little ready money for\r\nhis taxes, for the Communal authorities will probably sell his cow if he\r\ndoes not pay his arrears.** In desperation he accepts the conditions\r\nand puts off the evil day--consoling himself with the reflection that\r\nperhaps (avos\u0027) something may turn up in the meantime--but when the time\r\ncomes for fulfilling his engagements the dilemma revives. According\r\nto the contract he ought to work nearly the whole summer for the\r\nproprietor; but he has his own land to attend to, and he has to make\r\nprovision for the winter. In such circumstances the temptation to evade\r\nthe terms of the contract is probably too strong to be resisted.\r\n\r\n     * Amongst themselves the peasants are not addicted to\r\n     thieving, as is proved by the fact that they habitually\r\n     leave their doors unlocked when the inmates of the house are\r\n     working in the fields; but if the muzhik finds in the\r\n     proprietor\u0027s farmyard a piece of iron or a bit of rope, or\r\n     any of those little things that he constantly requires and\r\n     has difficulty in obtaining, he is very apt to pick it up\r\n     and carry it home.  Gathering firewood in the landlord\u0027s\r\n     forest he does not consider as theft, because \"God planted\r\n     the trees and watered them,\" and in the time of serfage he\r\n     was allowed to supply himself with firewood in this way.\r\n\r\n     ** Until last year (1904) they could use also corporal\r\n     punishment as a means of pressure, and I am not sure that\r\n     they do not occasionally use it still, though it is no\r\n     longer permitted by law.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, as in other countries, the principle holds true that for\r\ngood labour a fair price must be paid. Several large proprietors of my\r\nacquaintance who habitually act on this principle assure me that they\r\nalways obtain as much good labour as they require. I must add, however,\r\nthat these fortunate proprietors have the advantage of possessing a\r\ncomfortable amount of working capital, and are therefore not compelled,\r\nas so many of their less fortunate neighbours are, to manage their\r\nestates on the hand-to-mouth principle.\r\n\r\nIt is only, I fear, a minority of the landed proprietors that have\r\ngrappled successfully with these and other difficulties of their\r\nposition. As a class they are impoverished and indebted, but this state\r\nof things is not due entirely to serf-emancipation. The indebtedness\r\nof the Noblesse is a hereditary peculiarity of much older date. By some\r\nauthorities it is attributed to the laws of Peter the Great, by which\r\nall nobles were obliged to spend the best part of their lives in the\r\nmilitary or civil service, and to leave the management of their estates\r\nto incompetent stewards. However that may be, it is certain that from\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century downwards the fact has frequently\r\noccupied the attention of the Government, and repeated attempts have\r\nbeen made to alleviate the evil. The Empress Elizabeth, Catherine II.,\r\nPaul, Alexander I., Nicholas I., Alexander II., and Alexander III. tried\r\nsuccessively, as one of the older ukazes expressed it, \"to free the\r\nNoblesse from debt and from greedy money-lenders, and to prevent\r\nhereditary estates from passing into the hands of strangers.\" The\r\nmeans commonly adopted was the creation of mortgage banks founded and\r\ncontrolled by the Government for the purpose of advancing money to\r\nlanded proprietors at a comparatively low rate of interest.\r\n\r\nThese institutions may have been useful to the few who desired to\r\nimprove their estates, but they certainly did not cure, and rather\r\ntended to foster, the inveterate improvidence of the many. On the eve of\r\nthe Emancipation the proprietors were indebted to the Government for\r\nthe sum of 425 millions of roubles, and 69 per cent. of their serfs\r\nwere mortgaged. A portion of this debt was gradually extinguished by the\r\nredemption operation, so that in 1880 over 300 millions had been paid\r\noff, but in the meantime new debts were being contracted. In 1873-74\r\nnine private land-mortgage banks were created, and there was such a rush\r\nto obtain money from them that their paper was a glut in the market, and\r\nbecame seriously depreciated. When the prices of grain rose in 1875-80\r\nthe mortgage debt was diminished, but when they began to fall in 1880\r\nit again increased, and in 1881 it stood at 396 millions. As the rate of\r\ninterest was felt to be very burdensome there was a strong feeling among\r\nthe landed proprietors at that time that the Government ought to help\r\nthem, and in 1883 the nobles of the province of Orel ventured to address\r\nthe Emperor on the subject. In reply to the address, Alexander III., who\r\nhad strong Conservative leanings, was graciously pleased to declare in\r\nan ukaz that \"it was really time to do something to help the Noblesse,\"\r\nand accordingly a new land-mortgage bank for the Noblesse was created.\r\nThe favourable terms offered by it were taken advantage of to such\r\nan extent that in the first four years of its activity (1886-90) it\r\nadvanced to the proprietors over 200 million roubles. Then came two\r\nfamine years, and in 1894 the mortgage debt of the Noblesse in that and\r\nother credit establishments was estimated at 994 millions. It has since\r\nprobably increased rather than diminished, for in that year the prices\r\nof grain began to fall steadily on all the corn-exchanges of the world,\r\nand they have never since recovered.\r\n\r\nBy means of mortgages some proprietors succeeded in weathering the\r\nstorm, but many gave up the struggle altogether, and settled in the\r\ntowns. In the space of thirty years 20,000 of them sold their estates,\r\nand thus, between 1861 and 1892, the area of land possessed by the\r\nNoblesse diminished 30 per cent.--from 77,804,000 to 55,500,000\r\ndessyatins.\r\n\r\nThis expropriation of the Noblesse, as it is called, was evidently not\r\nthe result merely of the temporary economic disturbance caused by the\r\nabolition of serfage, for as time went on it became more rapid. During\r\nthe first twenty years the average annual amount of Noblesse land sold\r\nwas 517,000 dessyatins, and it rose steadily until 1892-96, when it\r\nreached the amount of 785,000. As I have already stated, the townward\r\nmovement of the proprietors was strongest in the barren Northern\r\nprovinces. In the province of Olonetz, for example, they have already\r\nparted with 87 per cent. of their land. In the black-soil region, on the\r\ncontrary, there is no province in which more than 27 per cent. of the\r\nNoblesse land has been alienated, and in one province (Tula) the amount\r\nis only 19 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe habit of mortgaging and selling estates does not necessarily mean\r\nthe impoverishment of the landlords as a class. If the capital raised in\r\nthat way is devoted to agricultural improvements, the result may be an\r\nincrease of wealth. Unfortunately, in Russia the realised capital\r\nwas usually not so employed. A very large proportion of it was spent\r\nunproductively, partly in luxuries and living abroad, and partly in\r\nunprofitable commercial and industrial speculations. The industrial\r\nand railway fever which raged at the time induced many to risk and\r\nlose their capital, and it had indirectly an injurious effect on all by\r\nmaking money plentiful in the towns and creating a more expensive style\r\nof living, from which the landed gentry could not hold entirely aloof.\r\n\r\nSo far I have dwelt on the dark shadows of the picture, but it is not\r\nall shadow. In the last forty years the production and export of grain,\r\nwhich constitute the chief source of revenue for the Noblesse, have\r\nincreased enormously, thanks mainly to the improved means of transport.\r\nIn the first decade after the Emancipation (1860-70) the average annual\r\nexport did not exceed 88 million puds; in the second decade (1870-80) it\r\nleapt up to 218 millions; and so it went up steadily until in the\r\nlast decade of the century it had reached 388 millions--i.e., over six\r\nmillion tons. At the same time the home trade had increased likewise\r\nin consequence of the rapidly growing population of the towns. All this\r\nmust have enriched the land-proprietors. Not to such an extent, it is\r\ntrue, as the figures seem to indicate, because the old prices could not\r\nbe maintained. Rye, for example, which in 1868 stood at 129 kopeks\r\nper pud, fell as low as 56, and during the rest of the century, except\r\nduring a short time in 1881-82 and the famine years of 1891-92, when\r\nthere was very little surplus to sell, it never rose above 80. Still,\r\nthe increase in quantity more than counterbalanced the fall in price.\r\nFor example: in 1881 the average price of grain per pud was 119, and in\r\n1894 it had sunk to 59; but the amount exported during that time rose\r\nfrom 203 to 617 million puds, and the sum received for it had risen from\r\n242 to 369 millions of roubles. Surely the whole of that enormous sum\r\nwas not squandered on luxuries and unprofitable speculation!\r\n\r\nThe pessimists, however--and in Russia their name is legion--will not\r\nadmit that any permanent advantage has been derived from this enormous\r\nincrease in exports. On the contrary, they maintain that it is a\r\nnational misfortune, because it is leading rapidly to a state of\r\npermanent impoverishment. It quickly exhausted, they say, the large\r\nreserves of grain in the village, so that as soon as there was a very\r\nbad harvest the Government had to come to the rescue and feed the\r\nstarving peasantry. Worse than this, it compromised the future\r\nprosperity of the country. Being in pecuniary difficulties, and\r\nconsequently impatient to make money, the proprietors increased\r\ninordinately the area of grain-producing land at the expense of\r\npasturage and forests, with the result that the live stock and the\r\nmanuring of the land were diminished, the fertility of the soil\r\nimpaired, and the necessary quantity of moisture in the atmosphere\r\ngreatly lessened. There is some truth in this contention; but it would\r\nseem that the soil and climate have not been affected so much as the\r\npessimists suppose, because in recent years there have been some very\r\ngood harvests.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, I think it may be justly said that the efforts of\r\nthe landed proprietors to work their estates without serf labour have\r\nnot as yet been brilliantly successful. Those who have failed are in the\r\nhabit of complaining that they have not received sufficient support from\r\nthe Government, which is accused of having systematically sacrificed the\r\ninterests of agriculture, the mainstay of the national resources, to the\r\ncreation of artificial and unnecessary manufacturing industries. How far\r\nsuch complaints and accusations are well founded I shall not attempt to\r\ndecide. It is a complicated polemical question, into which the reader\r\nwould probably decline to accompany me. Let us examine rather what\r\ninfluence the above-mentioned changes have had on the peasantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATED PEASANTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Effects of Liberty--Difficulty of Obtaining Accurate\r\nInformation--Pessimist Testimony of the Proprietors--Vague Replies of\r\nthe Peasants--My Conclusions in 1877--Necessity of Revising Them--My\r\nInvestigations Renewed in 1903--Recent Researches by Native Political\r\nEconomists--Peasant Impoverishment Universally Recognised--Various\r\nExplanations Suggested--Demoralisation of the Common People--Peasant\r\nSelf-government--Communal System of Land Tenure--Heavy\r\nTaxation--Disruption of Peasant Families--Natural Increase of\r\nPopulation--Remedies Proposed--Migration--Reclamation of Waste\r\nLand--Land-purchase by Peasantry--Manufacturing Industry--Improvement of\r\nAgricultural Methods--Indications of Progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of last chapter I pointed out in general terms\r\nthe difficulty of describing clearly the immediate consequences of the\r\nEmancipation. In beginning now to speak of the influence which the great\r\nreform has had on the peasantry, I feel that the difficulty has reached\r\nits climax. The foreigner who desires merely to gain a general idea of\r\nthe subject cannot be expected to take an interest in details, and even\r\nif he took the trouble to examine them attentively, he would derive from\r\nthe labour little real information. What he wishes is a clear, concise,\r\nand dogmatic statement of general results. Has the material and moral\r\ncondition of the peasantry improved since the Emancipation? That is the\r\nsimple question which he has to put, and he naturally expects a simple,\r\ncategorical answer.\r\n\r\nIn beginning my researches in this interesting field of inquiry, I had\r\nno adequate conception of the difficulties awaiting me. I imagined that\r\nI had merely to question intelligent, competent men who had had abundant\r\nopportunities of observation, and to criticise and boil down the\r\ninformation collected; but when I put this method of investigation to\r\nthe test of experience it proved unsatisfactory. Very soon I came\r\nto perceive that my authorities were very far from being impartial\r\nobservers. Most of them were evidently suffering from shattered\r\nillusions. They had expected that the Emancipation would produce\r\ninstantaneously a wonderful improvement in the life and character of\r\nthe rural population, and that the peasant would become at once a sober,\r\nindustrious, model agriculturist.\r\n\r\nThese expectations were not realised. One year passed, five years\r\npassed, ten years passed, and the expected transformation did not take\r\nplace. On the contrary, there appeared certain very ugly phenomena which\r\nwere not at all in the programme. The peasants began to drink more\r\nand to work less,* and the public life which the Communal institutions\r\nproduced was by no means of a desirable kind. The \"bawlers\" (gorlopany)\r\nacquired a prejudicial influence in the Village Assemblies, and in very\r\nmany Volosts the peasant judges, elected by their fellow-villagers,\r\nacquired a bad habit of selling their decisions for vodka. The natural\r\nconsequence of all this was that those who had indulged in exaggerated\r\nexpectations sank into a state of inordinate despondency, and imagined\r\nthings to be much worse than they really were.\r\n\r\n     * I am not at all sure that the peasants really drank more,\r\n     but such was, and still is, a very general conviction.\r\n\r\nFor different reasons, those who had not indulged in exaggerated\r\nexpectations, and had not sympathised with the Emancipation in the form\r\nin which it was effected, were equally inclined to take a pessimistic\r\nview of the situation. In every ugly phenomenon they found a\r\nconfirmation of their opinions. The result was precisely what they had\r\nforetold. The peasants had used their liberty and their privileges to\r\ntheir own detriment and to the detriment of others!\r\n\r\nThe extreme \"Liberals\" were also inclined, for reasons of their own,\r\nto join in the doleful chorus. They desired that the condition of the\r\npeasantry should be further improved by legislative enactments, and\r\naccordingly they painted the evils in as dark colours as possible.\r\n\r\nThus, from various reasons, the majority of the educated classes were\r\nunduly disposed to represent to themselves and to others the actual\r\ncondition of the peasantry in a very unfavourable light, and I felt\r\nthat from them there was no hope of obtaining the lumen siccum which I\r\ndesired. I determined, therefore, to try the method of questioning the\r\npeasants themselves. Surely they must know whether their condition was\r\nbetter or worse than it had been before their Emancipation.\r\n\r\nAgain I was doomed to disappointment. A few months\u0027 experience sufficed\r\nto convince me that my new method was by no means so effectual as I had\r\nimagined. Uneducated people rarely make generalisations which have no\r\npractical utility, and I feel sure that very few Russian peasants ever\r\nput to themselves the question: Am I better off now than I was in the\r\ntime of serfage? When such a question is put to them they feel taken\r\naback. And in truth it is no easy matter to sum up the two sides of the\r\naccount and draw an accurate balance, save in those exceptional cases\r\nin which the proprietor flagrantly abused his authority. The present\r\nmoney-dues and taxes are often more burdensome than the labour-dues in\r\nthe old times. If the serfs had a great many ill-defined obligations\r\nto fulfil--such as the carting of the master\u0027s grain to market, the\r\npreparing of his firewood, the supplying him with eggs, chickens,\r\nhome-made linen, and the like--they had, on the other hand, a good many\r\nill-defined privileges. They grazed their cattle during a part of the\r\nyear on the manor-land; they received firewood and occasionally logs for\r\nrepairing their huts; sometimes the proprietor lent them or gave them\r\na cow or a horse when they had been visited by the cattle-plague or the\r\nhorse-stealer; and in times of famine they could look to their master\r\nfor support. All this has now come to an end. Their burdens and their\r\nprivileges have been swept away together, and been replaced by clearly\r\ndefined, unbending, unelastic legal relations. They have now to pay the\r\nmarket-price for every stick of firewood which they burn, for every log\r\nwhich they require for repairing their houses, and for every rood of\r\nland on which to graze their cattle. Nothing is now to be had gratis.\r\nThe demand to pay is encountered at every step. If a cow dies or a horse\r\nis stolen, the owner can no longer go to the proprietor with the hope of\r\nreceiving a present, or at least a loan without interest, but must,\r\nif he has no ready money, apply to the village usurer, who probably\r\nconsiders twenty or thirty per cent, as a by no means exorbitant rate of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBesides this, from the economic point of view village life has been\r\ncompletely revolutionised. Formerly the members of a peasant family\r\nobtained from their ordinary domestic resources nearly all they\r\nrequired. Their food came from their fields, cabbage-garden, and\r\nfarmyard. Materials for clothing were supplied by their plots of flax\r\nand their sheep, and were worked up into linen and cloth by the female\r\nmembers of the household. Fuel, as I have said, and torches wherewith\r\nto light the izba--for oil was too expensive and petroleum was\r\nunknown--were obtained gratis. Their sheep, cattle, and horses were bred\r\nat home, and their agricultural implements, except in so far as a little\r\niron was required, could be made by themselves without any pecuniary\r\nexpenditure. Money was required only for the purchase of a few cheap\r\ndomestic utensils, such as pots, pans, knives, hatchets, wooden dishes,\r\nand spoons, and for the payment of taxes, which were small in amount\r\nand often paid by the proprietor. In these circumstances the quantity of\r\nmoney in circulation among the peasants was infinitesimally small, the\r\nfew exchanges which took place in a village being generally effected\r\nby barter. The taxes, and the vodka required for village festivals,\r\nweddings, or funerals, were the only large items of expenditure for the\r\nyear, and they were generally covered by the sums brought home by the\r\nmembers of the family who went to work in the towns.\r\n\r\nVery different is the present condition of affairs. The spinning,\r\nweaving, and other home industries have been killed by the big\r\nfactories, and the flax and wool have to be sold to raise a little ready\r\nmoney for the numerous new items of expenditure. Everything has to be\r\nbought--clothes, firewood, petroleum, improved agricultural implements,\r\nand many other articles which are now regarded as necessaries of life,\r\nwhilst comparatively little is earned by working in the towns, because\r\nthe big families have been broken up, and a household now consists\r\nusually of husband and wife, who must both remain at home, and children\r\nwho are not yet bread-winners. Recalling to mind all these things and\r\nthe other drawbacks and advantages of his actual position, the old\r\nmuzhik has naturally much difficulty in striking a balance, and he may\r\nwell be quite sincere when, on being asked whether things now are on the\r\nwhole better or worse than in the time of serfage, he scratches the back\r\nof his head and replies hesitatingly, with a mystified expression on his\r\nwrinkled face: \"How shall I say to you? They are both better and worse!\"\r\n(\"Kak vam skazat\u0027? I lûtche i khûdzhe!\") If, however, you press him\r\nfurther and ask whether he would himself like to return to the old state\r\nof things, he is pretty sure to answer, with a slow shake of the head\r\nand a twinkle in his eye, as if some forgotten item in the account had\r\nsuddenly recurred to him: \"Oh, no!\"\r\n\r\nWhat materially increases the difficulty of this general computation is\r\nthat great changes have taken place in the well-being of the particular\r\nhouseholds. Some have greatly prospered, while others have become\r\nimpoverished. That is one of the most characteristic consequences of the\r\nEmancipation. In the old times the general economic stagnation and\r\nthe uncontrolled authority of the proprietor tended to keep all the\r\nhouseholds of a village on the same level. There was little opportunity\r\nfor an intelligent, enterprising serf to become rich, and if he\r\ncontrived to increase his revenue he had probably to give a considerable\r\nshare of it to the proprietor, unless he had the good fortune to belong\r\nto a grand seigneur like Count Sheremetief, who was proud of having\r\nrich men among his serfs. On the other hand, the proprietor, for evident\r\nreasons of self-interest, as well as from benevolent motives, prevented\r\nthe less intelligent and less enterprising members of the Commune from\r\nbecoming bankrupt. The Communal equality thus artificially maintained\r\nhas now disappeared, the restrictions on individual freedom of action\r\nhave been removed, the struggle for life has become intensified, and, as\r\nalways happens in such circumstances, the strong men go up in the world\r\nwhile the weak ones go to the wall. All over the country we find on the\r\none hand the beginnings of a village aristocracy--or perhaps we should\r\ncall it a plutocracy, for it is based on money--and on the other hand\r\nan ever-increasing pauperism. Some peasants possess capital, with which\r\nthey buy land outside the Commune or embark in trade, while others have\r\nto sell their live stock, and have sometimes to cede to neighbours their\r\nshare of the Communal property. This change in rural life is so\r\noften referred to that, in order to express it a new, barbarous word,\r\ndifferentsiatsia (differentiation) has been invented.\r\n\r\nHoping to obtain fuller information with the aid of official protection,\r\nI attached myself to one of the travelling sections of an agricultural\r\nCommission appointed by the Government, and during a whole summer I\r\nhelped to collect materials in the provinces bordering on the Volga. The\r\ninquiry resulted in a gigantic report of nearly 2,500 folio pages, but\r\nthe general conclusions were extremely vague. The peasantry, it was\r\nsaid, were passing, like the landed proprietors, through a period of\r\ntransition, in which the main features of their future normal life had\r\nnot yet become clearly defined. In some localities their condition had\r\ndecidedly improved, whereas in others it had improved little or not\r\nat all. Then followed a long list of recommendations in favour\r\nof Government assistance, better agronomic education, competitive\r\nexhibitions, more varied rotation of crops, and greater zeal on the\r\npart of the clergy in disseminating among the people moral principles in\r\ngeneral and love of work in particular.\r\n\r\nNot greatly enlightened by this official activity, I returned to my\r\nprivate studies, and at the end of six years I published my impressions\r\nand conclusions in the first edition of this work. While recognising\r\nthat there was much uncertainty as to the future, I was inclined, on the\r\nwhole, to take a hopeful view of the situation. I was unable, however,\r\nto maintain permanently that comfortable frame of mind. After my\r\ndeparture from Russia in 1878, the accounts which reached me from\r\nvarious parts of the country became blacker and blacker, and were partly\r\nconfirmed by short tours which I made in 1889-1896. At last, in the\r\nsummer of 1903, I determined to return to some of my old haunts and\r\nlook at things with my own eyes. At that moment some hospitable friends\r\ninvited me to pay them a visit at their country-house in the province of\r\nSmolensk, and I gladly accepted the invitation, because Smolensk, when\r\nI knew it formerly, was one of the poorest provinces, and I thought it\r\nwell to begin my new studies by examining the impoverishment, of which I\r\nhad heard so much, at its maximum.\r\n\r\nFrom the railway station at Viazma, where I arrived one morning at\r\nsunrise, I had some twenty miles to drive, and as soon as I got clear of\r\nthe little town I began my observations. What I saw around me seemed\r\nto contradict the sombre accounts I had received. The villages through\r\nwhich I passed had not at all the look of dilapidation and misery\r\nwhich I expected. On the contrary, the houses were larger and better\r\nconstructed than they used to be, and each of them had a chimney! That\r\nlatter fact was important because formerly a large proportion of the\r\npeasants of this region had no such luxury, and allowed the smoke to\r\nfind its exit by the open door. In vain I looked for a hut of the old\r\ntype, and my yamstchik assured me I should have to go a long way to find\r\none. Then I noticed a good many iron ploughs of the European model, and\r\nmy yamstchik informed me that their predecessor, the sokha with which I\r\nhad been so familiar, had entirely disappeared from the district. Next\r\nI noticed that in the neighbourhood of the villages flax was grown\r\nin large quantities. That was certainly not an indication of poverty,\r\nbecause flax is a valuable product which requires to be well manured,\r\nand plentiful manure implies a considerable quantity of live stock.\r\nLastly, before arriving at my destination, I noticed clover being grown\r\nin the fields. This made me open my eyes with astonishment, because\r\nthe introduction of artificial grasses into the traditional rotation of\r\ncrops indicates the transition to a higher and more intensive system of\r\nagriculture. As I had never seen clover in Russia except on the estates\r\nof very advanced proprietors, I said to my yamstchik:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, little brother! That field belongs to the landlord?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Master; it is muzhik-land.\"\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the country-house I told my friends what I had seen,\r\nand they explained it to me. Smolensk is no longer one of the poorer\r\nprovinces; it has become comparatively prosperous. In two or three\r\ndistricts large quantities of flax are produced and give the cultivators\r\na big revenue; in other districts plenty of remunerative work is\r\nsupplied by the forests. Everywhere a considerable proportion of the\r\nyounger men go regularly to the towns and bring home savings enough to\r\npay the taxes and make a little surplus in the domestic budget. A few\r\ndays afterwards the village secretary brought me his books, and showed\r\nme that there were practically no arrears of taxation.\r\n\r\nPassing on to other provinces I found similar proofs of progress\r\nand prosperity, but at the same time not a few indications of\r\nimpoverishment; and I was rapidly relapsing into my previous state of\r\nuncertainty as to whether any general conclusions could be drawn,\r\nwhen an old friend, himself a first-rate authority with many years of\r\npractical experience, came to my assistance.* He informed me that a\r\nnumber of specialists had recently made detailed investigations into\r\nthe present economic conditions of the rural population, and he kindly\r\nplaced at my disposal, in his charming country-house near Moscow, the\r\nvoluminous researches of these investigators. Here, during a good many\r\nweeks, I revelled in the statistical materials collected, and to the\r\nbest of my ability I tested the conclusions drawn from them. Many of\r\nthese conclusions I had to dismiss with the Scotch verdict of \"not\r\nproven,\" whilst others seemed to me worthy of acceptance. Of these\r\nlatter the most important were those drawn from the arrears of taxation.\r\n\r\n     * I hope I am committing no indiscretion when I say that the\r\n     old friend in question was Prince Alexander Stcherbatof of\r\n     Vasilefskoe.\r\n\r\nThe arrears in the payment of taxes may be regarded as a pretty safe\r\nbarometer for testing the condition of the rural population, because\r\nthe peasant habitually pays his rates and taxes when he has the means of\r\ndoing so; when he falls seriously and permanently into arrears it may be\r\nassumed that he is becoming impoverished. If the arrears fluctuate\r\nfrom year to year, the causes of the impoverishment may be regarded as\r\naccidental and perhaps temporary, but if they steadily accumulate, we\r\nmust conclude that there is something radically wrong. Bearing these\r\nfacts in mind, let us hear what the statistics say.\r\n\r\nDuring the first twenty years after the Emancipation (1861-81) things\r\nwent on in their old grooves. The poor provinces remained poor, and the\r\nfertile provinces showed no signs of distress. During the next twenty\r\nyears (1881-1901) the arrears of the whole of European Russia rose,\r\nroughly speaking, from 27 to 144 millions of roubles, and the increase,\r\nstrange to say, took place in the fertile provinces. In 1890, for\r\nexample, out of 52 millions, nearly 41 millions, or 78 per cent., fell\r\nto the share of the provinces of the Black-earth Zone. In seven of these\r\nthe average arrears per male, which had been in 1882 only 90 kopeks,\r\nrose in 1893 to 600, and in 1899 to 2,200! And this accumulation had\r\ntaken place in spite of reductions of taxation to the extent of 37\r\nmillion roubles in 1881-83, and successive famine grants from the\r\nTreasury in 1891-99 to the amount of 203 millions.* On the other hand,\r\nin the provinces with a poor soil the arrears had greatly decreased. In\r\nSmolensk, for example, they had sunk from 202 per cent, to 13 per cent.\r\nof the annual sum to be paid, and in nearly all the other provinces of\r\nthe west and north a similar change for the better had taken place.\r\n\r\nThese and many other figures which I might quote show that a great\r\nand very curious economic revolution has been gradually effected. The\r\nBlack-earth Zone, which was formerly regarded as the inexhaustible\r\ngranary of the Empire, has become impoverished, whilst the provinces\r\nwhich were formerly regarded as hopelessly poor are now in a\r\ncomparatively flourishing condition. This fact has been officially\r\nrecognised. In a classification of the provinces according to their\r\ndegree of prosperity, drawn up by a special commission of experts in\r\n1903, those with a poor light soil appear at the top, and those with the\r\nfamous black earth are at the bottom of the list. In the deliberations\r\nof the commission many reasons for this extraordinary state of things\r\nare adduced. Most of them have merely a local significance. The big\r\nfact, taken as a whole, seems to me to show that, in consequence of\r\ncertain changes of which I shall speak presently, the peasantry\r\nof European Russia can no longer live by the traditional modes of\r\nagriculture, even in the most fertile districts, and require for their\r\nsupport some subsidiary occupations such as are practised in the less\r\nfertile provinces.\r\n\r\n     * In 1901 an additional famine grant of 33 1/2 million\r\n     roubles had to be made by the Government.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of impoverishment is the decrease in the quantity of live\r\nstock. According to the very imperfect statistics available, for every\r\nhundred inhabitants the number of horses has decreased from 26 to 17,\r\nthe number of cattle from 36 to 25, and the number of sheep from 73 to\r\n40. This is a serious matter, because it means that the land is not\r\nso well manured and cultivated as formerly, and is consequently not so\r\nproductive. Several economists have attempted to fix precisely to what\r\nextent the productivity has decreased, but I confess I have little faith\r\nin the accuracy of their conclusions. M. Polenof, for example, a most\r\nable and conscientious investigator, calculates that between 1861 and\r\n1895, all over Russia, the amount of food produced, in relation to the\r\nnumber of the population, has decreased by seven per cent. His methods\r\nof calculation are ingenious, but the statistical data with which he\r\noperates are so far from accurate that his conclusions on this point\r\nhave, in my opinion, little or no scientific value. With all due\r\ndeference to Russian economists, I may say parenthetically that they are\r\nvery found of juggling with carelessly collected statistics, as if their\r\ndata were mathematical quantities.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Zemstvos have grappled with this question of peasant\r\nimpoverishment, and the data which they have collected make a very\r\ndoleful impression. In the province of Moscow, for example, a careful\r\ninvestigation gave the following results: Forty per cent. of the\r\npeasant households had no longer any horses, 15 per cent. had given up\r\nagriculture altogether, and about 10 per cent. had no longer any\r\nland. We must not, however, assume, as is often done, that the peasant\r\nfamilies who have no live stock and no longer till the land are utterly\r\nruined. In reality many of them are better off than their neighbours who\r\nappear as prosperous in the official statistics, having found profitable\r\noccupation in the home industries, in the towns, in the factories, or on\r\nthe estates of the landed proprietors. It must be remembered that Moscow\r\nis the centre of one of the regions in which manufacturing industry has\r\nprogressed with gigantic strides during the last half-century, and it\r\nwould be strange indeed if, in such a region, the peasantry who supply\r\nthe labour to the towns and factories remained thriving agriculturists.\r\nThat many Russians are surprised and horrified at the actual state of\r\nthings shows to what an extent the educated classes are still under the\r\nillusion that Russia can create for herself a manufacturing industry\r\ncapable of competing with that of Western Europe without uprooting from\r\nthe soil a portion of her rural population.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the purely agricultural regions that families officially\r\nclassed as belonging to the peasantry may be regarded as on the brink of\r\npauperism because they have no live stock, and even with regard to them\r\nI should hesitate to make such an assumption, because the muzhiks, as I\r\nhave already had occasion to remark, have strange nomadic habits unknown\r\nto the rural population of other countries. It is a mistake, therefore,\r\nto calculate the Russian peasant\u0027s budget exclusively on the basis of\r\nlocal resources.\r\n\r\nTo the pessimists who assure me that according to their calculations the\r\npeasantry in general must be on the brink of starvation, I reply that\r\nthere are many facts, even in the statistical tables on which they\r\nrely, which run counter to their deductions. Let me quote one by way\r\nof illustration. The total amount of deposits in savings banks, about\r\none-fourth of which is believed to belong to the rural population,\r\nrose in the course of six years (1894-1900) from 347 to 680 millions of\r\nroubles. Besides the savings banks, there existed in the rural districts\r\non 1st December, 1902, no less than 1,614 small-credit institutions,\r\nwith a total capital (1st January, 1901) of 69 million roubles, of which\r\nonly 4,653,000 had been advanced by the State Bank and the Zemstvo, the\r\nremainder coming in from private sources. This is not much for a big\r\ncountry like Russia, but it is a beginning, and it suggests that the\r\nimpoverishment is not so severe and so universal as the pessimists would\r\nhave us believe.\r\n\r\nThere is thus room for differences of opinion as to how far the\r\npeasantry have become impoverished, but there is no doubt that their\r\ncondition is far from satisfactory, and we have to face the important\r\nproblem why the abolition of serfage has not produced the beneficent\r\nconsequences which even moderate men so confidently predicted, and how\r\nthe present unsatisfactory state of things is to be remedied.\r\n\r\nThe most common explanation among those who have never seriously studied\r\nthe subject is that it all comes from the demoralisation of the common\r\npeople. In this view there is a modicum of truth. That the peasantry\r\ninjure their material welfare by drunkenness and improvidence there can\r\nbe no reasonable doubt, as is shown by the comparatively flourishing\r\nstate of certain villages of Old Ritualists and Molokanye in which there\r\nis no drunkenness, and in which the community exercises a strong moral\r\ncontrol over the individual members. If the Orthodox Church could\r\nmake the peasantry refrain from the inordinate use of strong drink as\r\neffectually as it makes them refrain during a great part of the year\r\nfrom animal food, and if it could instil into their minds a few simple\r\nmoral principles as successfully as it has inspired them with a belief\r\nin the efficacy of the Sacraments, it would certainly confer on them an\r\ninestimable benefit. But this is not to be expected. The great majority\r\nof the parish priests are quite unfit for such a task, and the few who\r\nhave aspirations in that direction rarely acquire a perceptible moral\r\ninfluence over their parishioners. Perhaps more is to be expected from\r\nthe schoolmaster than from the priest, but it will be long before the\r\nschools can produce even a partial moral regeneration. Their\r\nfirst influence, strange as the assertion may seem, is often in a\r\ndiametrically opposite direction. When only a few peasants in a village\r\ncan read and write they have such facilities for overreaching their\r\n\"dark\" neighbours that they are apt to employ their knowledge for\r\ndishonest purposes; and thus it occasionally happens that the man who\r\nhas the most education is the greatest scoundrel in the Mir. Such facts\r\nare often used by the opponents of popular education, but in reality\r\nthey supply a good reason for disseminating primary education as rapidly\r\nas possible. When all the peasants have learned to read and write they\r\nwill present a less inviting field for swindling, and the temptations\r\nto dishonesty will be proportionately diminished. Meanwhile, it is only\r\nfair to state that the common assertions about drunkenness being greatly\r\non the increase are not borne out by the official statistics concerning\r\nthe consumption of spirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nAfter drunkenness, the besetting sin which is supposed to explain\r\nthe impoverishment of the peasantry is incorrigible laziness. On that\r\nsubject I feel inclined to put in a plea of extenuating circumstances in\r\nfavour of the muzhik. Certainly he is very slow in his movements--slower\r\nperhaps than the English rustic--and he has a marvellous capacity for\r\nwasting valuable time without any perceptible qualms of conscience; but\r\nhe is in this respect, if I may use a favourite phrase of the Social\r\nScientists, \"the product of environment.\" To the proprietors who\r\nhabitually reproach him with time-wasting he might reply with a very\r\nstrong tu quoque argument, and to all the other classes the argument\r\nmight likewise be addressed. The St. Petersburg official, for example,\r\nwho writes edifying disquisitions about peasant indolence, considers\r\nthat for himself attendance at his office for four hours, a large\r\nportion of which is devoted to the unproductive labour of cigarette\r\nsmoking, constitutes a very fair day\u0027s work. The truth is that in\r\nRussia the struggle for life is not nearly so intense as in more densely\r\npopulated countries, and society is so constituted that all can live\r\nwithout very strenuous exertion. The Russians seem, therefore, to the\r\ntraveller who comes from the West an indolent, apathetic race. If the\r\ntraveller happens to come from the East--especially if he has been\r\nliving among pastoral races--the Russians will appear to him energetic\r\nand laborious. Their character in this respect corresponds to their\r\ngeographical position: they stand midway between the laborious,\r\npainstaking, industrious population of Western Europe and the indolent,\r\nundisciplined, spasmodically energetic populations of Central Asia. They\r\nare capable of effecting much by vigorous, intermittent effort--witness\r\nthe peasant at harvest-time, or the St. Petersburg official when some\r\nbig legislative project has to be submitted to the Emperor within a\r\ngiven time--but they have not yet learned regular laborious habits. In\r\nshort, the Russians might move the world if it could be done by a\r\njerk, but they are still deficient in that calm perseverance and dogged\r\ntenacity which characterise the Teutonic race.\r\n\r\nWithout seeking further to determine how far the moral defects of the\r\npeasantry have a deleterious influence on their material welfare, I\r\nproceed to examine the external causes which are generally supposed to\r\ncontribute largely to their impoverishment, and will deal first with the\r\nevils of peasant self-government.\r\n\r\nThat the peasant self-government is very far from being in a\r\nsatisfactory condition must be admitted by any impartial observer. The\r\nmore laborious and well-to-do peasants, unless they wish to abuse their\r\nposition directly or indirectly for their own advantage, try to escape\r\nelection as office-bearers, and leave the administration in the hands\r\nof the less respectable members. Not unfrequently a Volost Elder trades\r\nwith the money he collects as dues or taxes; and sometimes, when he\r\nbecomes insolvent, the peasants have to pay their taxes and dues a\r\nsecond time. The Village Assemblies, too, have become worse than they\r\nwere in the days of serfage. At that time the Heads of Households--who,\r\nit must be remembered, have alone a voice in the decisions--were few\r\nin number, laborious, and well-to-do, and they kept the lazy, unruly\r\nmembers under strict control. Now that the large families have been\r\nbroken up and almost every adult peasant is Head of a Household, the\r\nCommunal affairs are sometimes decided by a noisy majority; and certain\r\nCommunal decisions may be obtained by \"treating the Mir\"--that is to\r\nsay, by supplying a certain amount of vodka. Often I have heard old\r\npeasants speak of these things, and finish their recital by some such\r\nremark as this: \"There is no order now; the people have been spoiled; it\r\nwas better in the time of the masters.\"\r\n\r\nThese evils are very real, and I have no desire to extenuate them, but\r\nI believe they are by no means so great as is commonly supposed. If\r\nthe lazy, worthless members of the Commune had really the direction of\r\nCommunal affairs we should find that in the Northern Agricultural Zone,\r\nwhere it is necessary to manure the soil, the periodical redistributions\r\nof the Communal land would be very frequent; for in a new distribution\r\nthe lazy peasant has a good chance of getting a well-manured lot in\r\nexchange for the lot which he has exhausted. In reality, so far as my\r\nobservations extend, these general distributions of the land are not\r\nmore frequent than they were before.\r\n\r\nOf the various functions of the peasant self-government the judicial\r\nare perhaps the most frequently and the most severely criticised.\r\nAnd certainly not without reason, for the Volost Courts are too often\r\naccessible to the influence of alcohol, and in some districts the\r\npeasants say that he who becomes a judge takes a sin on his soul. I am\r\nnot at all sure, however, that it would be well to abolish these courts\r\naltogether, as some people propose. In many respects they are better\r\nsuited to peasant requirements than the ordinary tribunals. Their\r\nprocedure is infinitely simpler, more expeditious, and incomparably\r\nless expensive, and they are guided by traditional custom and plain\r\ncommon-sense, whereas the ordinary tribunals have to judge according\r\nto the civil law, which is unknown to the peasantry and not always\r\napplicable to their affairs.\r\n\r\nFew ordinary judges have a sufficiently intimate knowledge of the minute\r\ndetails of peasant life to be able to decide fairly the cases that are\r\nbrought before the Volost Courts; and even if a Justice had sufficient\r\nknowledge he could not adopt the moral and juridical notions of the\r\npeasantry. These are often very different from those of the upper\r\nclasses. In cases of matrimonial separation, for instance, the educated\r\nman naturally assumes that, if there is any question of aliment, it\r\nshould be paid by the husband to the wife. The peasant, on the\r\ncontrary, assumes as naturally that it should be paid by the wife to the\r\nhusband--or rather to the Head of the Household--as a compensation\r\nfor the loss of labour which her desertion involves. In like manner,\r\naccording to traditional peasant-law, if an unmarried son is working\r\naway from home, his earnings do not belong to himself, but to the\r\nfamily, and in Volost Court they could be claimed by the Head of the\r\nHousehold.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, it is true, the peasant judges allow their respect for old\r\ntraditional conceptions in general and for the authority of parents in\r\nparticular, to carry them a little too far. I was told lately of one\r\naffair which took place not long ago, within a hundred miles of Moscow,\r\nin which the judge decided that a respectable young peasant should be\r\nflogged because he refused to give his father the money he earned\r\nas groom in the service of a neighbouring proprietor, though it was\r\nnotorious in the district that the father was a disreputable old\r\ndrunkard who carried to the kabak (gin-shop) all the money he could\r\nobtain by fair means and foul. When I remarked to my informant, who was\r\nnot an admirer of peasant institutions, that the incident reminded me of\r\nthe respect for the patria potestas in old Roman times, he stared at\r\nme with a look of surprise and indignation, and exclaimed laconically,\r\n\"Patria potestas? . . . Vodka!\" He was evidently convinced that the\r\ndisreputable father had got his respectable son flogged by \"treating\"\r\nthe judges. In such cases flogging can no longer be used, for the Volost\r\nCourts, as we have seen, were recently deprived of the right to inflict\r\ncorporal punishment.\r\n\r\nThese administrative and judicial abuses gradually reached the ears of\r\nthe Government, and in 1889 it attempted to remove them by creating\r\na body of Rural Supervisors (Zemskiye Natchalniki). Under their\r\nsupervision and control some abuses may have been occasionally prevented\r\nor corrected, and some rascally Volost secretaries may have been\r\npunished or dismissed, but the peasant self-government as a whole has\r\nnot been perceptibly improved.\r\n\r\nLet us glance now at the opinions of those who hold that the material\r\nprogress of the peasantry is prevented chiefly, not by the mere abuses\r\nof the Communal administration, but by the essential principles of the\r\nCommunal institutions, and especially by the practice of periodically\r\nredistributing the Communal land. From the theoretical point of view\r\nthis question is one of great interest, and it may acquire in the future\r\nan immense practical significance; but for the present it has not, in my\r\nopinion, the importance which is usually attributed to it. There can be\r\nno doubt that it is much more difficult to farm well on a large number\r\nof narrow strips of land, many of which are at a great distance from the\r\nfarmyard, than on a compact piece of land which the farmer may divide\r\nand cultivate as he pleases; and there can be as little doubt that the\r\nhusbandman is more likely to improve his land if his tenure is secure.\r\nAll this and much more of the same kind must be accepted as indisputable\r\ntruth, but it has little direct bearing on the practical question under\r\nconsideration. We are not considering in the abstract whether it would\r\nbe better that the peasant should be a farmer with abundant capital and\r\nall the modern scientific appliances, but simply the practical question,\r\nWhat are the obstructions which at present prevent the peasant from\r\nameliorating his actual condition?\r\n\r\nThat the Commune prevents its members from adopting various systems\r\nof high farming is a supposition which scarcely requires serious\r\nconsideration. The peasants do not yet think of any such radical\r\ninnovations; and if they did, they have neither the knowledge nor the\r\ncapital necessary to effect them. In many villages a few of the richer\r\nand more intelligent peasants have bought land outside of the Commune\r\nand cultivate it as they please, free from all Communal restraints; and\r\nI have always found that they cultivate this property precisely in the\r\nsame way as their share of the Communal land. As to minor changes, we\r\nknow by experience that the Mir opposes to them no serious obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of beet for the production of sugar has greatly\r\nincreased in the central and southwestern provinces, and flax is now\r\nlargely produced in Communes in northern districts where it was formerly\r\ncultivated merely for domestic use. The Communal system is, in fact,\r\nextremely elastic, and may be modified as soon as the majority of the\r\nmembers consider modifications profitable. When the peasants begin to\r\nthink of permanent improvements, such as drainage, irrigation, and the\r\nlike, they will find the Communal institutions a help rather than\r\nan obstruction; for such improvements, if undertaken at all, must\r\nbe undertaken on a larger scale, and the Mir is an already existing\r\nassociation. The only permanent improvements which can be for the\r\npresent profitably undertaken consist in the reclaiming of waste land;\r\nand such improvements are already sometimes attempted. I know at\r\nleast of one case in which a Commune in the province of Yaroslavl\r\nhas reclaimed a considerable tract of waste land by means of hired\r\nlabourers. Nor does the Mir prevent in this respect individual\r\ninitiative. In many Communes of the northern provinces it is a received\r\nprinciple of customary law that if any member reclaims waste land he is\r\nallowed to retain possession of it for a number of years proportionate\r\nto the amount of labour expended.\r\n\r\nBut does not the Commune, as it exists, prevent good cultivation\r\naccording to the mode of agriculture actually in use?\r\n\r\nExcept in the far north and the steppe region, where the agriculture\r\nis of a peculiar kind, adapted to the local conditions, the peasants\r\ninvariably till their land according to the ordinary three-field system,\r\nin which good cultivation means, practically speaking, the plentiful\r\nuse of manure. Does, then, the existence of the Mir prevent the peasants\r\nfrom manuring their fields well?\r\n\r\nMany people who speak on this subject in an authoritative tone seem to\r\nimagine that the peasants in general do not manure their fields at all.\r\nThis idea is an utter mistake. In those regions, it is true, where the\r\nrich black soil still retains a large part of its virgin fertility,\r\nthe manure is used as fuel, or simply thrown away, because the peasants\r\nbelieve that it would not be profitable to put it on their fields, and\r\ntheir conviction is, at least to some extent, well founded;* but in\r\nthe Northern Agricultural Zone, where unmanured soil gives almost no\r\nharvest, the peasants put upon their fields all the manure they possess.\r\nIf they do not put enough it is simply because they have not sufficient\r\nlive stock.\r\n\r\n     * As recently as two years ago (1903) I found that one of\r\n     the most intelligent and energetic landlords of the province\r\n     of Voronezh followed in this respect the example of the\r\n     peasants, and he assured me that he had proved by experience\r\n     the advantage of doing so.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the southern provinces, where no manure is required,\r\nthat periodical re-distributions take place frequently. As we travel\r\nnorthward we find the term lengthens; and in the Northern Agricultural\r\nZone, where manure is indispensable, general re-distributions are\r\nextremely rare. In the province of Yaroslavl, for example, the Communal\r\nland is generally divided into two parts: the manured land lying near\r\nthe village, and the unmanured land lying beyond. The latter alone is\r\nsubject to frequent re-distribution. On the former the existing tenures\r\nare rarely disturbed, and when it becomes necessary to give a share to a\r\nnew household, the change is effected with the least possible prejudice\r\nto vested rights.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Government has always been to admit redistributions\r\nin principle, but to prevent their too frequent recurrence. For this\r\npurpose the Emancipation Law stipulated that they could be decreed\r\nonly by a three-fourths majority of the Village Assembly, and in 1893\r\na further obstacle was created by a law providing that the minimum\r\nterm between two re-distributions should be twelve years, and that they\r\nshould never be undertaken without the sanction of the Rural Supervisor.\r\n\r\nA certain number of Communes have made the experiment of transforming\r\nthe Communal tenure into hereditary allotments, and its only visible\r\neffect has been that the allotments accumulate in the hands of the\r\nricher and more enterprising peasants, and the poorer members of the\r\nCommune become landless, while the primitive system of agriculture\r\nremains unimproved.\r\n\r\nUp to this point I have dealt with the so-called causes of peasant\r\nimpoverishment which are much talked of, but which are, in my opinion,\r\nonly of secondary importance. I pass now to those which are more\r\ntangible and which have exerted on the condition of the peasantry a more\r\npalpable influence. And, first, inordinate taxation.\r\n\r\nThis is a very big subject, on which a bulky volume might be written,\r\nbut I shall cut it very short, because I know that the ordinary reader\r\ndoes not like to be bothered with voluminous financial statistics.\r\nBriefly, then, the peasant has to pay three kinds of direct taxation:\r\nImperial to the Central Government, local to the Zemstvo, and Commune to\r\nthe Mir and the Volost; and besides these he has to pay a yearly sum for\r\nthe redemption of the land-allotment which he received at the time of\r\nthe Emancipation. Taken together, these form a heavy burden, but for\r\nten or twelve years the emancipated peasantry bore it patiently, without\r\nfalling very deeply into arrears. Then began to appear symptoms of\r\ndistress, especially in the provinces with a poor soil, and in 1872\r\nthe Government appointed a Commission of Inquiry, in which I had the\r\nprivilege of taking part unofficially. The inquiry showed that something\r\nought to be done, but at that moment the Government was so busy with\r\nadministrative reforms and with trying to develop industry and commerce\r\nthat it had little time to devote to studying and improving the economic\r\nposition of the silent, long-suffering muzhik. It was not till nearly\r\nten years later, when the Government began to feel the pinch of the\r\never-increasing arrears, that it recognised the necessity of relieving\r\nthe rural population. For this purpose it abolished the salt-tax and the\r\npoll-tax and repeatedly lessened the burden of the redemption-payments.\r\nAt a later period (1899) it afforded further relief by an important\r\nreform in the mode of collecting the direct taxes. From the police,\r\nwho often ruined peasant householders by applying distraint\r\nindiscriminately, the collection of taxes was transferred to special\r\nauthorities who took into consideration the temporary pecuniary\r\nembarrassments of the tax-payers. Another benefit conferred on the\r\npeasantry by this reform is that an individual member of the Commune\r\nis no longer responsible for the fiscal obligations of the Commune as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nSince these alleviations have been granted the annual total demanded\r\nfrom the peasantry for direct taxation and land-redemption payments\r\nis 173 million roubles, and the average annual sum to be paid by each\r\npeasant household varies, according to the locality, from 11 1/2 to 20\r\nroubles (21s. 6d. to 40s.). In addition to this annuity there is a heavy\r\nburden of accumulated arrears, especially in the central and eastern\r\nprovinces, which amounted in 1899 to 143 millions. Of the indirect taxes\r\nI can say nothing definite, because it is impossible to calculate, even\r\napproximately, the share of them which falls on the rural population,\r\nbut they must not be left out of account. During the ten years of M.\r\nWitte\u0027s term of office the revenue of the Imperial Treasury was nearly\r\ndoubled, and though the increase was due partly to improvements in the\r\nfinancial administration, we can hardly believe that the peasantry did\r\nnot in some measure contribute to it. In any case, it is very difficult,\r\nif not impossible, for them, under actual conditions, to improve their\r\neconomic position. On that point all Russian economists are agreed.\r\nOne of the most competent and sober-minded of them, M. Schwanebach,\r\ncalculates that the head of a peasant household, after deducting\r\nthe grain required to feed his family, has to pay into the Imperial\r\nTreasury, according to the district in which he resides, from 25 to 100\r\nper cent, of his agricultural revenue. If that ingenious calculation\r\nis even approximately correct, we must conclude that further financial\r\nreforms are urgently required, especially in those provinces where the\r\npopulation live exclusively by agriculture.\r\n\r\nHeavy as the burden of taxation undoubtedly is, it might perhaps be\r\nborne without very serious inconvenience if the peasant families could\r\nutilise productively all their time and strength. Unfortunately in the\r\nexisting economic organisation a great deal of their time and energy is\r\nnecessarily wasted. Their economic life was radically dislocated by\r\nthe Emancipation, and they have not yet succeeded in reorganising it\r\naccording to the new conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the time of serfage an estate formed, from the economic point of\r\nview, a co-operative agricultural association, under a manager who\r\npossessed unlimited authority, and sometimes abused it, but who was\r\ngenerally worldly-wise enough to understand that the prosperity of the\r\nwhole required the prosperity of the component parts. By the abolition\r\nof serfage the association was dissolved and liquidated, and the strong,\r\ncompact whole fell into a heap of independent units, with separate and\r\noften mutually hostile interests. Some of the disadvantages of this\r\nchange for the peasantry I have already enumerated above. The most\r\nimportant I have now to mention. In virtue of the Emancipation Law each\r\nfamily received an amount of land which tempted it to continue farming\r\non its own account, but which did not enable it to earn a living and\r\npay its rates and taxes. The peasant thus became a kind of amphibious\r\ncreature--half farmer and half something else--cultivating his allotment\r\nfor a portion of his daily bread, and obliged to have some other\r\noccupation wherewith to cover the inevitable deficit in his domestic\r\nbudget. If he was fortunate enough to find near his home a bit of land\r\nto be let at a reasonable rent, he might cultivate it in addition to his\r\nown and thereby gain a livelihood; but if he had not the good luck to\r\nfind such a piece of land in the immediate neighbourhood, he had to look\r\nfor some subsidiary occupation in which to employ his leisure time; and\r\nwhere was such occupation to be found in an ordinary Russian village?\r\nIn former years he might have employed himself perhaps in carting the\r\nproprietor\u0027s grain to distant markets or still more distant seaports,\r\nbut that means of making a little money has been destroyed by the\r\nextension of railways. Practically, then, he is now obliged to choose\r\nbetween two alternatives: either to farm his allotment and spend a\r\ngreat part of the year in idleness, or to leave the cultivation of\r\nhis allotment to his wife and children and to seek employment\r\nelsewhere--often at such a distance that his earnings hardly cover the\r\nexpenses of the journey. In either case much time and energy are wasted.\r\n\r\nThe evil results of this state of things were intensified by another\r\nchange which was brought about by the Emancipation. In the time of\r\nserfage the peasant families, as I have already remarked, were usually\r\nvery large. They remained undivided, partly from the influence\r\nof patriarchal conceptions, but chiefly because the proprietors,\r\nrecognising the advantage of large units, prevented them from breaking\r\nup. As soon as the proprietor\u0027s authority was removed, the process\r\nof disintegration began and spread rapidly. Every one wished to be\r\nindependent, and in a very short time nearly every able-bodied\r\nmarried peasant had a house of his own. The economic consequences were\r\ndisastrous. A large amount of money had to be expended in constructing\r\nnew houses and farmsteadings; and the old habit of one male member\r\nremaining at home to cultivate the land allotment with the female\r\nmembers of the family whilst the others went to earn wages elsewhere\r\nhad to be abandoned. Many large families, which had been prosperous and\r\ncomfortable--rich according to peasant conceptions--dissolved into three\r\nor four small ones, all on the brink of pauperism.\r\n\r\nThe last cause of peasant impoverishment that I have to mention is\r\nperhaps the most important of all: I mean the natural increase of\r\npopulation without a corresponding increase in the means of subsistence.\r\nSince the Emancipation in 1861 the population has nearly doubled, whilst\r\nthe amount of Communal land has remained the same. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that when talking with peasants about their actual condition,\r\none constantly hears the despairing cry, \"Zemli malo!\" (\"There is not\r\nenough land\"); and one notices that those who look a little ahead ask\r\nanxiously: \"What is to become of our children? Already the Communal\r\nallotment is too small for our wants, and the land outside is doubling\r\nand trebling in price! What will it be in the future?\" At the same time,\r\nnot a few Russian economists tell us--and their apprehensions are\r\nshared by foreign observers--that millions of peasants are in danger of\r\nstarvation in the near future.\r\n\r\nMust we, then, accept for Russia the Malthus doctrine that population\r\nincreases more rapidly than the means of subsistence, and that\r\nstarvation can be avoided only by plague, pestilence, war, and other\r\ndestructive forces? I think not. It is quite true that, if the amount\r\nof land actually possessed by the peasantry and the present system\r\nof cultivating it remained unchanged, semi-starvation would be the\r\ninevitable result within a comparatively short space of time; but the\r\ndanger can be averted, and the proper remedies are not far to seek. If\r\nRussia is suffering from over-population, it must be her own fault,\r\nfor she is, with the exception of Norway and Sweden, the most thinly\r\npopulated country in Europe, and she has more than her share of fertile\r\nsoil and mineral resources.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map showing the density of population in the various\r\nprovinces suggests an obvious remedy, and I am happy to say it is\r\nalready being applied. The population of the congested districts of the\r\ncentre is gradually spreading out, like a drop of oil on a sheet of soft\r\npaper, towards the more thinly populated regions of the south and east.\r\nIn this way the vast region containing millions and millions of acres\r\nwhich lies to the north of the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Caspian, and\r\nCentral Asia is yearly becoming more densely peopled, and agriculture is\r\nsteadily encroaching on the pastoral area. Breeders of sheep and cattle,\r\nwho formerly lived and throve in the western portion of that great\r\nexpanse, are being pushed eastwards by the rapid increase in the value\r\nof land, and their place is being taken by enterprising tillers of the\r\nsoil. Further north another stream of emigration is flowing into Central\r\nSiberia. It does not flow so rapidly, because in that part of the\r\nEmpire, unlike the bare, fertile steppes of the south, the land has to\r\nbe cleared before the seed can be sown, and the pioneer colonists have\r\nto work hard for a year or two before they get any return for their\r\nlabour; but the Government and private societies come to their\r\nassistance, and for the last twenty years their numbers have been\r\nsteadily increasing. During the ten years 1886-96 the annual contingent\r\nrose from 25,000 to 200,000, and the total number amounted to nearly\r\n800,000. For the subsequent period I have not been able to obtain the\r\nofficial statistics, but a friend who has access to the official sources\r\nof information on this subject assures me that during the last twelve\r\nyears about four millions of peasants from European Russia have been\r\nsuccessfully settled in Siberia.\r\n\r\nEven in the European portion of the Empire millions of acres which are\r\nat present unproductive might be utilised. Any one who has travelled by\r\nrail from Berlin to St. Petersburg must have noticed how the landscape\r\nsuddenly changes its character as soon as he has crossed the frontier.\r\nLeaving a prosperous agricultural country, he traverses for many weary\r\nhours a region in which there is hardly a sign of human habitation,\r\nthough the soil and climate of that region resembles closely the soil\r\nand climate of East Prussia. The difference lies in the amount of labour\r\nand capital expended. According to official statistics the area of\r\nEuropean Russia contains, roughly speaking, 406 millions of dessyatins,\r\nof which 78 millions, or 19 per cent., are classified as neudobniya,\r\nunfit for cultivation; 157 millions, or 39 per cent., as forest; 106\r\nmillions, or 26 per cent., as arable land; and 65 millions, or 16 per\r\ncent., as pasturage. Thus the arable and pasture land compose only 42\r\nper cent., or considerably less than half the area.\r\n\r\nOf the land classed as unfit for cultivation--19 per cent. of the\r\nwhole--a large portion, including the perennially frozen tundri of the\r\nfar north, must ever remain unproductive, but in latitudes with a milder\r\nclimate this category of land is for the most part ordinary morass or\r\nswamp, which can be transformed into pasturage, or even into arable\r\nland, by drainage at a moderate cost. As a proof of this statement I\r\nmay cite the draining of the great Pinsk swamps, which was begun by the\r\nGovernment in 1872. If we may trust an official report of the progress\r\nof the works in 1897, an area of 2,855,000 dessyatins (more than seven\r\nand a half million acres) had been drained at an average cost of about\r\nthree shillings an acre, and the price of land had risen from four to\r\ntwenty-eight roubles per dessyatin.\r\n\r\nReclamation of marshes might be undertaken elsewhere on a much more\r\nmoderate scale. The observant traveller on the highways and byways of\r\nthe northern provinces must have noticed on the banks of almost every\r\nstream many acres of marshy land producing merely reeds or coarse\r\nrank grass that no well-brought-up animal would look at. With a little\r\nelementary knowledge of engineering and the expenditure of a moderate\r\namount of manual labour these marshes might be converted into excellent\r\npasture or even into highly productive kitchen-gardens; but the peasants\r\nhave not yet learned to take advantage of such opportunities, and the\r\nreformers, who deal only in large projects and scientific panaceas for\r\nthe cure of impoverishment, consider such trifles as unworthy of their\r\nattention. The Scotch proverb that if the pennies be well looked after,\r\nthe pounds will look after themselves, contains a bit of homely wisdom\r\ntotally unknown to the Russian educated classes.\r\n\r\nAfter the morasses, swamps, and marshes come the forests, constituting\r\n39 per cent. of the whole area, and the question naturally arises\r\nwhether some portions of them might not be advantageously transformed\r\ninto pasturage or arable land. In the south and east they have been\r\ndiminished to such an extent as to affect the climate injuriously, so\r\nthat the area of them should be increased rather than lessened; but in\r\nthe northern provinces the vast expanses of forest, covering millions\r\nof acres, might perhaps be curtailed with advantage. The proprietors\r\nprefer, however, to keep them in their present condition because they\r\ngive a modest revenue without any expenditure of capital.\r\n\r\nTherein lies the great obstacle to land-reclamation in Russia: it\r\nrequires an outlay of capital, and capital is extremely scarce in the\r\nEmpire of the Tsars. Until it becomes more plentiful, the area of arable\r\nland and pasturage is not likely to be largely increased, and other\r\nmeans of checking the impoverishment of the peasantry must be adopted.\r\n\r\nA less expensive means is suggested by the statistics of foreign trade.\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have seen that from 1860 to 1900 the average\r\nannual export of grain rose steadily from under 1 1/2 millions to over 6\r\nmillions of tons. It is evident, therefore, that in the food supply, so\r\nfar from there being a deficiency, there has been a large and constantly\r\nincreasing surplus. If the peasantry have been on short rations, it\r\nis not because the quantity of food produced has fallen short of the\r\nrequirements of the population, but because it has been unequally\r\ndistributed. The truth is that the large landed proprietors produce more\r\nand the peasants less than they consume, and it has naturally occurred\r\nto many people that the present state of things might be improved if\r\na portion of the arable land passed, without any socialistic,\r\nrevolutionary measures, from the one class to the other. This operation\r\nbegan spontaneously soon after the Emancipation. Well-to-do peasants who\r\nhad saved a little money bought from the proprietors bits of land near\r\ntheir villages and cultivated them in addition to their allotments. At\r\nfirst this extension of peasant land was confined within very narrow\r\nlimits, because the peasants had very little capital at their disposal,\r\nbut in 1882 the Government came to their aid by creating the Peasant\r\nLand Bank, the object of which was to advance money to purchasers of the\r\npeasant class on the security of the land purchased, at the rate of 7\r\n1/2 per cent., including sinking fund.* From that moment the purchases\r\nincreased rapidly. They were made by individual peasants, by rural\r\nCommunes, and, most of all, by small voluntary associations composed of\r\nthree, four, or more members. In the course of twenty years (1883-1903)\r\nthe Bank made 47,791 advances, and in this way were purchased about\r\neighteen million acres. This sounds a very big acquisition, but it will\r\nnot do much to relieve the pressure on the peasantry as a whole, because\r\nit adds only about 6 per cent. to the amount they already possessed in\r\nvirtue of the Emancipation Law.\r\n\r\n     * This arrangement extinguishes the debt in 34 1/2 years; an\r\n     additional 1 per cent, extinguishes it in 24 1/2 years.  By\r\n     recent legislation other arrangements are permitted.\r\n\r\nNearly all of this land purchased by the peasantry comes directly or\r\nindirectly from the Noblesse, and much more will doubtless pass from\r\nthe one class to the other if the Government continues to encourage the\r\noperation; but already symptoms of a change of policy are apparent. In\r\nthe higher official regions it is whispered that the existing policy is\r\nobjectionable from the political point of view, and one sometimes hears\r\nthe question asked: Is it right and desirable that the Noblesse, who\r\nhave ever done their duty in serving faithfully the Tsar and Fatherland,\r\nand who have ever been the representatives of civilisation and culture\r\nin Russian country life, should be gradually expropriated in favour\r\nof other and less cultivated social classes? Not a few influential\r\npersonages are of opinion that such a change is unjust and undesirable,\r\nand they argue that it is not advantageous to the peasants themselves,\r\nbecause the price of land has risen much more than the rents. It is not\r\nat all uncommon, for example, to find that land can be rented at five\r\nroubles per dessyatin, whereas it cannot be bought under 200 roubles. In\r\nthat case the peasant can enjoy the use of the land at the moderate rate\r\nof 2 1/2 per cent. of the capital value, whereas by purchasing the land\r\nwith the assistance of the bank he would have to pay, without sinking\r\nfund, more than double that rate. The muzhik, however, prefers to be\r\nowner of the land, even at a considerable sacrifice. When he can be\r\ninduced to give his reasons, they are usually formulated thus: \"With\r\nmy own land I can do as I like; if I hire land from the neighbouring\r\nproprietor, who knows whether, at the end of the term, he may not raise\r\nthe rent or refuse to renew the contract at any price?\"\r\n\r\nEven if the Government should continue to encourage the purchase of land\r\nby the peasantry, the process is too slow to meet all the requirements\r\nof the situation. Some additional expedient must be found, and we\r\nnaturally look for it in the experience of older countries with a denser\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn the more densely populated countries of Western Europe a safety-valve\r\nfor the inordinate increase of the rural population has been provided\r\nby the development of manufacturing industry. High wages and the\r\nattractions of town life draw the rural population to the industrial\r\ncentres, and the movement has increased to such an extent that already\r\ncomplaints are heard of the rural districts becoming depopulated. In\r\nRussia a similar movement is taking place on a smaller scale. During the\r\nlast forty years, under the fostering influence of a protective tariff,\r\nthe manufacturing industry has made gigantic strides, as we shall see in\r\na future chapter, and it has already absorbed about two millions of the\r\nredundant hands in the villages; but it cannot keep pace with the rapid\r\nincreasing surplus. Two millions are less than two per cent. of the\r\npopulation. The great mass of the people has always been, and must long\r\ncontinue to be, purely agricultural; and it is to their fields that\r\nthey must look for the means of subsistence. If the fields do not\r\nsupply enough for their support under the existing primitive methods\r\nof cultivation, better methods must be adopted. To use a favourite\r\nsemi-scientific phrase, Russia has now reached the point in her economic\r\ndevelopment at which she must abandon her traditional extensive system\r\nof agriculture and adopt a more intensive system. So far all competent\r\nauthorities are agreed. But how is the transition, which requires\r\ntechnical knowledge, a spirit of enterprise, an enormous capital, and a\r\ndozen other things which the peasantry do not at present possess, to be\r\neffected? Here begin the well-marked differences of opinion.\r\n\r\nHitherto the momentous problem has been dealt with chiefly by the\r\ntheorists and doctrinaires who delight in radical solutions by means of\r\npanaceas, and who have little taste for detailed local investigation and\r\ngradual improvement. I do not refer to the so-called \"Saviours of the\r\nFatherland\" (Spasiteli Otetchestva), well-meaning cranks and visionaries\r\nwho discover ingenious devices for making their native country at once\r\nprosperous and happy. I speak of the great majority of reasonable,\r\neducated men who devote some attention to the problem. Their favourite\r\nmethod of dealing with it is this: The intensive system of agriculture\r\nrequires scientific knowledge and a higher level of intellectual\r\nculture. What has to be done, therefore, is to create agricultural\r\ncolleges supplied with all the newest appliances of agronomic research\r\nand to educate the peasantry to such an extent that they may be able to\r\nuse the means which science recommends.\r\n\r\nFor many years this doctrine prevailed in the Press, among the reading\r\npublic, and even in the official world. The Government was accordingly\r\nurged to improve and multiply the agronomic colleges and the schools of\r\nall grades and descriptions. Learned dissertations were published on the\r\nchemical constitution of the various soils, the action of the\r\natmosphere on the different ingredients, the necessity of making careful\r\nmeteorological observations, and numerous other topics of a similar\r\nkind; and would-be reformers who had no taste for such highly technical\r\nresearches could console themselves with the idea that they were\r\nadvancing the vital interests of the country by discussing the relative\r\nmerits of Communal and personal land-tenure--deciding generally in\r\nfavour of the former as more in accordance with the peculiarities of\r\nRussian, as contrasted with West European, principles of economic and\r\nsocial development.\r\n\r\nWhile much valuable time and energy were thus being expended to little\r\npurpose, on the assumption that the old system might be left untouched\r\nuntil the preparations for a radical solution had been completed,\r\ndisagreeable facts which could not be entirely overlooked gradually\r\nproduced in influential quarters the conviction that the question was\r\nmuch more urgent than was commonly supposed. A sensitive chord in the\r\nheart of the Government was struck by the steadily increasing arrears of\r\ntaxation, and spasmodic attempts have since been made to cure the evil.\r\n\r\nIn the local administration, too, the urgency of the question has come\r\nto be recognised, and measures are now being taken by the Zemstvo to\r\nhelp the peasantry in making gradually the transition to that higher\r\nsystem of agriculture which is the only means of permanently saving\r\nthem from starvation. For this purpose, in many districts well-trained\r\nspecialists have been appointed to study the local conditions and to\r\nrecommend to the villagers such simple improvements as are within their\r\nmeans. These improvements may be classified under the following heads:\r\n\r\n(1) Increase of the cereal crops by better seed and improved implements.\r\n\r\n(2) Change in the rotation of crops by the introduction of certain\r\ngrasses and roots which improve the soil and supply food for live stock.\r\n\r\n(3) Improvement and increase of live stock, so as to get more\r\nlabour-power, more manure, more dairy-produce, and more meat.\r\n\r\n(4) Increased cultivation of vegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\nWith these objects in view the Zemstvo is establishing depots in which\r\nimproved implements and better seed are sold at moderate prices, and the\r\npayments are made in installments, so that even the poorer members of\r\nthe community can take advantage of the facilities offered. Bulls and\r\nstallions are kept at central points for the purpose of improving the\r\nbreed of cattle and horses, and the good results are already visible.\r\nElementary instruction in farming and gardening is being introduced into\r\nthe primary schools. In some districts the exertions of the Zemstvo\r\nare supplemented by small agricultural societies, mutual credit\r\nassociations, and village banks, and these are to some extent assisted\r\nby the Central Government. But the beneficent action in this direction\r\nis not all official. Many proprietors deserve great praise for the good\r\ninfluence which they exercise on the peasants of their neighbourhood\r\nand the assistance they give them; and it must be admitted that their\r\npatience is often sorely tried, for the peasants have the obstinacy of\r\nignorance, and possess other qualities which are not sympathetic. I know\r\none excellent proprietor who began his civilising efforts by giving\r\nto the Mir of the nearest village an iron plough as a model and a fine\r\npedigree ram as a producer, and who found, on returning from a tour\r\nabroad, that during his absence the plough had been sold for vodka,\r\nand the pedigree ram had been eaten before it had time to produce\r\nany descendants! In spite of this he continues his efforts, and not\r\naltogether without success.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the progress of the peasantry is not so\r\nrapid as could be wished. The muzhik is naturally conservative, and is\r\never inclined to regard novelties with suspicion. Even when he is half\r\nconvinced of the utility of some change, he has still to think about it\r\nfor a long time and talk it over again and again with his friends and\r\nneighbours, and this preparatory stage of progress may last for years.\r\nUnless he happens to be a man of unusual intelligence and energy, it is\r\nonly when he sees with his own eyes that some humble individual of his\r\nown condition in life has actually gained by abandoning the old routine\r\nand taking to new courses, that he makes up his mind to take the plunge\r\nhimself. Still, he is beginning to jog on. E pur si muove! A spirit of\r\nprogress is beginning to move on the face of the long-stagnant waters,\r\nand progress once begun is pretty sure to continue with increasing\r\nrapidity. With starvation hovering in the rear, even the most\r\nconservative are not likely to stop or turn back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE ZEMSTVO AND THE LOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity of Reorganising the Provincial Administration--Zemstvo Created\r\nin 1864--My First Acquaintance with the Institution--District and\r\nProvincial Assemblies--The Leading Members--Great Expectations Created\r\nby the Institution--These Expectations Not Realised--Suspicions and\r\nHostility of the Bureaucracy--Zemstvo Brought More Under Control of the\r\nCentralised Administration--What It Has Really Done--Why It Has Not\r\nDone More---Rapid Increase of the Rates--How Far the Expenditure\r\nIs Judicious--Why the Impoverishment of the Peasantry Was\r\nNeglected--Unpractical, Pedantic Spirit--Evil Consequences--Chinese and\r\nRussian Formalism--Local Self-Government of Russia Contrasted with That\r\nof England--Zemstvo Better than Its Predecessors--Its Future.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the emancipation of the serfs the reform most urgently required\r\nwas the improvement of the provincial administration. In the time of\r\nserfage the Emperor Nicholas, referring to the landed proprietors, used\r\nto say in a jocular tone that he had in his Empire 50,000 most zealous\r\nand efficient hereditary police-masters. By the Emancipation Law the\r\nauthority of these hereditary police-masters was for ever abolished, and\r\nit became urgently necessary to put something else in its place. Peasant\r\nself-government was accordingly organised on the basis of the rural\r\nCommune; but it fell far short of meeting the requirements of the\r\nsituation. Its largest unit was the Volost, which comprises merely a\r\nfew contiguous Communes, and its action is confined exclusively to the\r\npeasantry. Evidently it was necessary to create a larger administrative\r\nunit, in which the interests of all classes of the population could be\r\nattended to, and for this purpose Alexander II. in November, 1859,\r\nmore than a year before the Emancipation Edict, instructed a special\r\nCommission to prepare a project for giving to the inefficient,\r\ndislocated provincial administration greater unity and independence. The\r\nproject was duly prepared, and after being discussed in the Council\r\nof State it received the Imperial sanction in January, 1864. It was\r\nsupposed to give, in the words of an explanatory memorandum attached\r\nto it, \"as far as possible a complete and logical development to the\r\nprinciple of local self-government.\" Thus was created the Zemstvo,*\r\nwhich has recently attracted considerable attention in Western Europe,\r\nand which is destined, perhaps, to play a great political part in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n     * The term Zemstvo is derived from the word Zemlya, meaning\r\n     land, and might be translated, if a barbarism were\r\n     permissible, by Land-dom on the analogy of Kingdom, Dukedom,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\nMy personal acquaintance with this interesting institution dates from\r\n1870. Very soon after my arrival at Novgorod in that year, I made the\r\nacquaintance of a gentleman who was described to me as \"the president\r\nof the provincial Zemstvo-bureau,\" and finding him amiable and\r\ncommunicative, I suggested that he might give me some information\r\nregarding the institution of which he was the chief local\r\nrepresentative. With the utmost readiness he proposed to be my Mentor,\r\nintroduced me to his colleagues, and invited me to come and see him\r\nat his office as often as I felt inclined. Of this invitation I made\r\nabundant use. At first my visits were discreetly few and short, but when\r\nI found that my new friend and his colleagues really wished to instruct\r\nme in all the details of Zemstvo administration, and had arranged a\r\nspecial table in the president\u0027s room for my convenience, I became a\r\nregular attendant, and spent daily several hours in the bureau, studying\r\nthe current affairs, and noting down the interesting bits of statistical\r\nand other information which came before the members, as if I had been\r\none of their number. When they went to inspect the hospital, the lunatic\r\nasylum, the seminary for the preparation of village schoolmasters, or\r\nany other Zemstvo institution, they invariably invited me to accompany\r\nthem, and made no attempt to conceal from me the defects which they\r\nhappened to discover.\r\n\r\nI mention all this because it illustrates the readiness of most Russians\r\nto afford every possible facility to a foreigner who wishes seriously to\r\nstudy their country. They believe that they have long been misunderstood\r\nand systematically calumniated by foreigners, and they are extremely\r\ndesirous that the prevalent misconceptions regarding their country\r\nshould be removed. It must be said to their honour that they have\r\nlittle or none of that false patriotism which seeks to conceal national\r\ndefects; and in judging themselves and their institutions they are\r\ninclined to be over-severe rather than unduly lenient. In the time\r\nof Nicholas I. those who desired to stand well with the Government\r\nproclaimed loudly that they lived in the happiest and best-governed\r\ncountry of the world, but this shallow official optimism has long since\r\ngone out of fashion. During all the years which I spent in Russia I\r\nfound everywhere the utmost readiness to assist me in my investigations,\r\nand very rarely noticed that habit of \"throwing dust in the eyes of\r\nforeigners,\" of which some writers have spoken so much.\r\n\r\nThe Zemstvo is a kind of local administration which supplements the\r\naction of the rural Communes, and takes cognizance of those higher\r\npublic wants which individual Communes cannot possibly satisfy. Its\r\nprincipal duties are to keep the roads and bridges in proper repair, to\r\nprovide means of conveyance for the rural police and other officials, to\r\nlook after primary education and sanitary affairs, to watch the state of\r\nthe crops and take measures against approaching famine, and, in short,\r\nto undertake, within certain clearly defined limits, whatever seems\r\nlikely to increase the material and moral well-being of the population.\r\nIn form the institution is Parliamentary--that is to say, it consists\r\nof an assembly of deputies which meets regularly once a year, and of\r\na permanent executive bureau elected by the Assembly from among its\r\nmembers. If the Assembly be regarded as a local Parliament, the bureau\r\ncorresponds to the Cabinet. In accordance with this analogy my friend\r\nthe president was sometimes jocularly termed the Prime Minister. Once\r\nevery three years the deputies are elected in certain fixed proportions\r\nby the landed proprietors, the rural Communes, and the municipal\r\ncorporations. Every province (guberniya) and each of the districts\r\n(uyezdi) into which the province is subdivided has such an assembly and\r\nsuch a bureau.\r\n\r\nNot long after my arrival in Novgorod I had the opportunity of being\r\npresent at a District Assembly. In the ball-room of the \"Club de la\r\nNoblesse\" I found thirty or forty men seated round a long table covered\r\nwith green cloth. Before each member lay sheets of paper for the purpose\r\nof taking notes, and before the president--the Marshal of Noblesse for\r\nthe district--stood a small hand-bell, which he rang vigorously at the\r\ncommencement of the proceedings and on all the occasions when he wished\r\nto obtain silence. To the right and left of the president sat the\r\nmembers of the executive bureau (uprava), armed with piles of written\r\nand printed documents, from which they read long and tedious extracts,\r\ntill the majority of the audience took to yawning and one or two of the\r\nmembers positively went to sleep. At the close of each of these reports\r\nthe president rang his bell--presumably for the purpose of awakening the\r\nsleepers--and inquired whether any one had remarks to make on what\r\nhad just been read. Generally some one had remarks to make, and not\r\nunfrequently a discussion ensued. When any decided difference of opinion\r\nappeared a vote was taken by handing round a sheet of paper, or by the\r\nsimpler method of requesting the Ayes to stand up and the Noes to sit\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised me most in this assembly was that it was composed partly\r\nof nobles and partly of peasants--the latter being decidedly in the\r\nmajority--and that no trace of antagonism seemed to exist between the\r\ntwo classes. Landed proprietors and their ci-devant serfs, emancipated\r\nonly ten years before, evidently met for the moment on a footing of\r\nequality. The discussions were carried on chiefly by the nobles, but on\r\nmore than one occasion peasant members rose to speak, and their remarks,\r\nalways clear, practical, and to the point, were invariably listened\r\nto with respectful attention. Instead of that violent antagonism which\r\nmight have been expected, considering the constitution of the Assembly,\r\nthere was too much unanimity--a fact indicating plainly that the\r\nmajority of the members did not take a very deep interest in the matters\r\npresented to them.\r\n\r\nThis assembly was held in the month of September. At the beginning of\r\nDecember the Assembly for the Province met, and during nearly three\r\nweeks I was daily present at its deliberations. In general character and\r\nmode of procedure it resembled closely the District Assembly. Its chief\r\npeculiarities were that its members were chosen, not by the primary\r\nelectors, but by the assemblies of the ten districts which compose the\r\nprovince, and that it took cognisance merely of those matters which\r\nconcerned more than one district. Besides this, the peasant deputies\r\nwere very few in number--a fact which somewhat surprised me, because\r\nI was aware that, according to the law, the peasant members of the\r\nDistrict Assemblies were eligible, like those of the other classes. The\r\nexplanation is that the District Assemblies choose their most active\r\nmembers to represent them in the Provincial Assemblies, and consequently\r\nthe choice generally falls on landed proprietors. To this arrangement\r\nthe peasants make no objection, for attendance at the Provincial\r\nAssemblies demands a considerable pecuniary outlay, and payment to the\r\ndeputies is expressly prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nTo give the reader an idea of the elements composing this assembly, let\r\nme introduce him to a few of the members. A considerable section of them\r\nmay be described in a single sentence. They are commonplace men, who\r\nhave spent part of their youth in the public service as officers in the\r\narmy, or officials in the civil administration, and have since retired\r\nto their estates, where they gain a modest competence by farming. Some\r\nof them add to their agricultural revenue by acting as justices of the\r\npeace.* A few may be described more particularly.\r\n\r\n     * That is no longer possible.  The institution of justices\r\n     elected and paid by the Zemstvo was abolished in 1889.\r\n\r\nYou see there, for instance, that fine-looking old general in uniform,\r\nwith the St. George\u0027s Cross at his button-hole--an order given only for\r\nbravery in the field. That is Prince Suvorof, a grandson of the famous\r\ngeneral. He has filled high posts in the Administration without ever\r\ntarnishing his name by a dishonest or dishonourable action, and has\r\nspent a great part of his life at Court without ceasing to be frank,\r\ngenerous, and truthful. Though he has no intimate knowledge of current\r\naffairs, and sometimes gives way a little to drowsiness, his sympathies\r\nin disputed points are always on the right side, and when he gets to his\r\nfeet he always speaks in a clear soldierlike fashion.\r\n\r\nThe tall gaunt man, somewhat over middle age, who sits a little to\r\nthe left is Prince Vassiltchikof. He too, has an historic name, but he\r\ncherishes above all things personal independence, and has consequently\r\nalways kept aloof from the Imperial Administration and the Court. The\r\nleisure thus acquired he has devoted to study, and he has produced\r\nseveral valuable works on political and social science. An enthusiastic\r\nbut at the same time cool-headed abolitionist at the time of the\r\nEmancipation, he has since constantly striven to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of the peasantry by advocating the spread of primary\r\neducation, the rural credit associations in the village, the\r\npreservation of the Communal institutions, and numerous important\r\nreforms in the financial system. Both of these gentlemen, it is said,\r\ngenerously gave to their peasants more land than they were obliged\r\nto give by the Emancipation Law. In the Assembly Prince Vassiltchikof\r\nspeaks frequently, and always commands attention; and in all important\r\ncommittees he is leading member. Though a warm defender of the Zemstvo\r\ninstitutions, he thinks that their activity ought to be confined to\r\na comparatively narrow field, and he thereby differs from some of his\r\ncolleagues, who are ready to embark in hazardous, not to say fanciful,\r\nschemes for developing the natural resources of the province. His\r\nneighbour, Mr. P----, is one of the ablest and most energetic members\r\nof the Assembly. He is president of the executive bureau in one of the\r\ndistricts, where he has founded many primary schools and created several\r\nrural credit associations on the model of those which bear the name of\r\nSchultze Delitsch in Germany. Mr. S----, who sits beside him, was for\r\nsome years an arbiter between the proprietors and emancipated serfs,\r\nthen a member of the Provincial Executive Bureau, and is now director of\r\na bank in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nTo the right and left of the president--who is Marshal of Noblesse for\r\nthe province--sit the members of the bureau. The gentleman who reads\r\nthe long reports is my friend \"the Prime Minister,\" who began life as\r\na cavalry officer, and after a few years of military service retired\r\nto his estate; he is an intelligent, able administrator, and a man of\r\nconsiderable literary culture. His colleague, who assists him in reading\r\nthe reports, is a merchant, and director of the municipal bank. The next\r\nmember is also a merchant, and in some respects the most remarkable\r\nman in the room. Though born a serf, he is already, at middle age, an\r\nimportant personage in the Russian commercial world. Rumour says that\r\nhe laid the foundation of his fortune by one day purchasing a copper\r\ncauldron in a village through which he was passing on his way to St.\r\nPetersburg, where he hoped to gain a little money by the sale of some\r\ncalves. In the course of a few years he amassed an enormous fortune; but\r\ncautious people think that he is too fond of hazardous speculations, and\r\nprophesy that he will end life as poor as he began it.\r\n\r\nAll these men belong to what may be called the party of progress, which\r\nanxiously supports all proposals recognised as \"liberal,\" and especially\r\nall measures likely to improve the condition of the peasantry. Their\r\nchief opponent is that little man with close-cropped, bullet-shaped head\r\nand small piercing eyes, who may be called the Leader of the opposition.\r\nHe condemns many of the proposed schemes, on the ground that the\r\nprovince is already overtaxed, and that the expenditure ought to be\r\nreduced to the smallest possible figure. In the District Assembly\r\nhe preaches this doctrine with considerable success, for there the\r\npeasantry form the majority, and he knows how to use that terse, homely\r\nlanguage, interspersed with proverbs, which has far more influence on\r\nthe rustic mind than scientific principles and logical reasoning; but\r\nhere, in Provincial Assembly, his following composes only a respectable\r\nminority, and he confines himself to a policy of obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe Zemstvo of Novgorod had at that time the reputation of being one of\r\nthe most enlightened and energetic, and I must say that the proceedings\r\nwere conducted in a business-like, satisfactory way. The reports\r\nwere carefully considered, and each article of the annual budget was\r\nsubmitted to minute scrutiny and criticism. In several of the provinces\r\nwhich I afterwards visited I found that affairs were conducted in a very\r\ndifferent fashion: quorums were formed with extreme difficulty, and\r\nthe proceedings, when they at last commenced, were treated as mere\r\nformalities and despatched as speedily as possible. The character of\r\nthe Assembly depends of course on the amount of interest taken in local\r\npublic affairs. In some districts this interest is considerable; in\r\nothers it is very near zero.\r\n\r\nThe birth of this new institution was hailed with enthusiasm, and\r\nproduced great expectations. At that time a large section of the Russian\r\neducated classes had a simple, convenient criterion for institutions of\r\nall kinds. They assumed as a self-evident axiom that the excellence\r\nof an institution must always be in proportion to its \"liberal\" and\r\ndemocratic character. The question as to how far it might be appropriate\r\nto the existing conditions and to the character of the people, and as to\r\nwhether it might not, though admirable in itself, be too expensive for\r\nthe work to be performed, was little thought of. Any organisation which\r\nrested on \"the elective principle,\" and provided an arena for free\r\npublic discussion, was sure to be well received, and these conditions\r\nwere fulfilled by the Zemstvo.\r\n\r\nThe expectations excited were of various kinds. People who thought more\r\nof political than economic progress saw in the Zemstvo the basis of\r\nboundless popular liberty. Prince Yassiltchikof, for example, though\r\nnaturally of a phlegmatic temperament, became for a moment enthusiastic,\r\nand penned the following words: \"With a daring unparalleled in the\r\nchronicles of the world, we have entered on the career of public life.\"\r\nIf local self-government in England had, in spite of its aristocratic\r\ncharacter, created and preserved political liberty, as had been proved\r\nby several learned Germans, what might be expected from institutions so\r\nmuch more liberal and democratic? In England there had never been county\r\nparliaments, and the local administration had always been in the hands\r\nof the great land-owners; whilst in Russia every district would have\r\nits elective assembly, in which the peasant would be on a level with\r\nthe richest landed proprietors. People who were accustomed to think of\r\nsocial rather than political progress expected that they would soon see\r\nthe country provided with good roads, safe bridges, numerous village\r\nschools, well-appointed hospitals, and all the other requisites of\r\ncivilisation. Agriculture would become more scientific, trade and\r\nindustry would be rapidly developed, and the material, intellectual,\r\nand moral condition of the peasantry would be enormously improved. The\r\nlistless apathy of provincial life and the hereditary indifference to\r\nlocal public affairs were now, it was thought, about to be dispelled;\r\nand in view of this change, patriotic mothers took their children to the\r\nannual assemblies in order to accustom them from their early years to\r\ntake an interest in the public welfare.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that these inordinate expectations were\r\nnot realised. From the very beginning there had been a misunderstanding\r\nregarding the character and functions of the new institutions. During\r\nthe short period of universal enthusiasm for reform the great officials\r\nhad used incautiously some of the vague liberal phrases then in fashion,\r\nbut they never seriously intended to confer on the child which they\r\nwere bringing into the world a share in the general government of the\r\ncountry; and the rapid evaporation of their sentimental liberalism,\r\nwhich began as soon as they undertook practical reforms, made them less\r\nand less conciliatory. When the vigorous young child, therefore, showed\r\na natural desire to go beyond the humble functions accorded to it, the\r\nstern parents proceeded to snub it and put it into its proper place.\r\nThe first reprimand was administered publicly in the capital. The\r\nSt. Petersburg Provincial Assembly, having shown a desire to play a\r\npolitical part, was promptly closed by the Minister of the Interior,\r\nand some of the members were exiled for a time to their homes in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis warning produced merely a momentary effect. As the functions of\r\nthe Imperial Administration and of the Zemstvo had never been clearly\r\ndefined, and as each was inclined to extend the sphere of its activity,\r\nfriction became frequent. The Zemstvo had the right, for example, to\r\nco-operate in the development of education, but as soon as it organised\r\nprimary schools and seminaries it came into contact with the Ministry of\r\nPublic Instruction. In other departments similar conflicts occurred,\r\nand the tchinovniks came to suspect that the Zemstvo had the ambition to\r\nplay the part of a parliamentary Opposition. This suspicion found formal\r\nexpression in at least one secret official document, in which the writer\r\ndeclares that \"the Opposition has built itself firmly a nest in the\r\nZemstvo.\" Now, if we mean to be just to both parties in this little\r\nfamily quarrel, we must admit that the Zemstvo, as I shall explain in\r\na future chapter, had ambitions of that kind, and it would have been\r\nbetter perhaps for the country at the present moment if it had been able\r\nto realise them. But this is a West-European idea. In Russia there is,\r\nand can be, no such thing as \"His Majesty\u0027s Opposition.\" To the Russian\r\nofficial mind the three words seem to contain a logical contradiction.\r\nOpposition to officials, even within the limits of the law, is\r\nequivalent to opposition to the Autocratic Power, of which they are the\r\nincarnate emanations; and opposition to what they consider the interests\r\nof autocracy comes within measurable distance of high treason. It was\r\nconsidered necessary, therefore, to curb and suppress the ambitious\r\ntendencies of the wayward child, and accordingly it was placed more and\r\nmore under the tutelage of the provincial Governors. To show how\r\nthe change was effected, let me give an illustration. In the older\r\narrangements the Governor could suspend the action of the Zemstvo only\r\non the ground of its being illegal or ultra vires, and when there was\r\nan irreconcilable difference of opinion between the two parties the\r\nquestion was decided judicially by the Senate; under the more recent\r\narrangements his Excellency can interpose his veto whenever he considers\r\nthat a decision, though it may be perfectly legal, is not conducive to\r\nthe public good, and differences of opinion are referred, not to the\r\nSenate, but to the Minister of the Interior, who is always naturally\r\ndisposed to support the views of his subordinate.\r\n\r\nIn order to put an end to all this insubordination, Count Tolstoy,\r\nthe reactionary Minister of the Interior, prepared a scheme of\r\nreorganisation in accordance with his anti-liberal views, but he died\r\nbefore he could carry it out, and a much milder reorganisation was\r\nadopted in the law of 12th (24th) June, 1890. The principal changes\r\nintroduced by that law were that the number of delegates in the\r\nAssemblies was reduced by about a fourth, and the relative strength of\r\nthe different social classes was altered. Under the old law the Noblesse\r\nhad about 42 per cent., and the peasantry about 38 per cent, of the\r\nseats; by the new electoral arrangements the former have 57 per cent,\r\nand the latter about 30. It does not necessarily follow, however,\r\nthat the Assemblies are more conservative or more subservient on that\r\naccount. Liberalism and insubordination are much more likely to be found\r\namong the nobles than among the peasants.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, as there was an apprehension in the higher\r\nofficial spheres of St. Petersburg that the opposition spirit of the\r\nZemstvo might find public expression in a printed form, the provincial\r\nGovernors received extensive rights of preventive censure with regard\r\nto the publication of the minutes of Zemstvo Assemblies and similar\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nWhat the bureaucracy, in its zeal to defend the integrity of the\r\nAutocratic Power, feared most of all was combination for a common\r\npurpose on the part of the Zemstvos of different provinces. It vetoed,\r\ntherefore, all such combinations, even for statistical purposes; and\r\nwhen it discovered, a few years ago, that leading members of the Zemstvo\r\nfrom all parts of the country were holding private meetings in Moscow\r\nfor the ostensible purpose of discussing economic questions, it ordered\r\nthem to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nEven within its proper sphere, as defined by law, the Zemstvo has not\r\naccomplished what was expected of it. The country has not been covered\r\nwith a network of macadamised roads, and the bridges are by no means as\r\nsafe as could be desired. Village schools and infirmaries are still far\r\nbelow the requirements of the population. Little or nothing has been\r\ndone for the development of trade or manufactures; and the villages\r\nremain very much what they were under the old Administration. Meanwhile\r\nthe local rates have been rising with alarming rapidity; and many\r\npeople draw from all this the conclusion that the Zemstvo is a worthless\r\ninstitution which has increased the taxation without conferring any\r\ncorresponding benefit on the country.\r\n\r\nIf we take as our criterion in judging the institution the exaggerated\r\nexpectations at first entertained, we may feel inclined to agree with\r\nthis conclusion, but this is merely tantamount to saying that the\r\nZemstvo has performed no miracles. Russia is much poorer and much less\r\ndensely populated than the more advanced nations which she takes as her\r\nmodel. To suppose that she could at once create for herself by means of\r\nan administrative reform all the conveniences which those more advanced\r\nnations enjoy, was as absurd as it would be to imagine that a poor man\r\ncan at once construct a magnificent palace because he has received from\r\na wealthy neighbour the necessary architectural plans. Not only years\r\nbut generations must pass before Russia can assume the appearance of\r\nGermany, France, or England. The metamorphosis may be accelerated or\r\nretarded by good government, but it could not be effected at once, even\r\nif the combined wisdom of all the philosophers and statesmen in Europe\r\nwere employed in legislating for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Zemstvo has, however, done much more than the majority of its\r\ncritics admit. It fulfils tolerably well, without scandalous peculation\r\nand jobbery, its commonplace, every-day duties, and it has created a\r\nnew and more equitable system of rating, by which landed proprietors and\r\nhouse-owners are made to bear their share of the public burdens. It has\r\ndone a very great deal to provide medical aid and primary education for\r\nthe common people, and it has improved wonderfully the condition of the\r\nhospitals, lunatic asylums, and other benevolent institutions committed\r\nto its charge. In its efforts to aid the peasantry it has helped to\r\nimprove the native breeds of horses and cattle, and it has created a\r\nsystem of obligatory fire-insurance, together with means for preventing\r\nand extinguishing fires in the villages--a most important matter in\r\na country where the peasants live in wooden houses and big fires are\r\nfearfully frequent. After neglecting for a good many years the essential\r\nquestion as to how the peasants\u0027 means of subsistence can be increased,\r\nit has latterly, as I have mentioned in a foregoing chapter, helped them\r\nto obtain improved agricultural implements and better seed, encouraged\r\nthe formation of small credit associations and savings banks, and\r\nappointed agricultural inspectors to teach them how they may introduce\r\nmodest improvements within their limited means.* At the same time, in\r\nmany districts it has endeavoured to assist the home industries which\r\nare threatened with annihilation by the big factories, and whenever\r\nmeasures have been proposed for the benefit of the rural population,\r\nsuch as the lowering of the land-redemption payments and the creation of\r\nthe Peasant Land Bank, it has invariably given them its cordial support.\r\n\r\n     * The amount expended for these objects in 1897, the latest year\r\n     for which I have statistical data, was about a million and a half\r\n     of roubles, or, roughly speaking, 150,000 pounds, distributed under\r\n     the following heads:--1. Agricultural tuition\r\n          41,100 pounds.\r\n     2. Experimental stations, museums, etc    19,800\r\n     3. Scientific agriculturists              17,400\r\n     4. Agricultural industries                26,700\r\n     5. Improving breeds of horses and cattle  45,300\r\n                                               -------\r\n                                               150,300 pounds.\r\n\r\nIf you ask a zealous member of the Zemstvo why it has not done more\r\nhe will probably tell you that it is because its activity has been\r\nconstantly restricted and counteracted by the Government. The Assemblies\r\nwere obliged to accept as presidents the Marshals of Noblesse, many of\r\nwhom were men of antiquated ideas and retrograde principles. At every\r\nturn the more enlightened, more active members found themselves opposed,\r\nthwarted, and finally checkmated by the Imperial officials. When a\r\nlaudable attempt was made to tax trade and industry more equitably the\r\nscheme was vetoed, and consequently the mercantile class, sure of being\r\nalways taxed at a ridiculously low maximum, have lost all interest in\r\nthe proceedings. Even with regard to the rating of landed and house\r\nproperty a low limit is imposed by the Government, because it is afraid\r\nthat if the rates were raised much it would not be able to collect the\r\nheavy Imperial taxation. The uncontrolled publicity which was at first\r\nenjoyed by the Assemblies was afterwards curtailed by the bureaucracy.\r\nUnder such restrictions all free, vigorous action became impossible, and\r\nthe institutions failed to effect what was reasonably anticipated.\r\n\r\nAll this is true in a certain sense, but it is not the whole truth. If\r\nwe examine some of the definite charges brought against the institution\r\nwe shall understand better its real character.\r\n\r\nThe most common complaint made against it is that it has enormously\r\nincreased the rates. On that point there is no possibility of dispute.\r\nAt first its expenditure in the thirty-four provinces in which it\r\nexisted was under six millions of roubles; in two years (1868) it\r\nhad jumped up to fifteen millions; in 1875 it was nearly twenty-eight\r\nmillions, in 1885 over forty-three millions, and at the end of the\r\ncentury it had attained the respectable figure of 95,800,000 roubles.\r\nAs each province had the right of taxing itself, the increase varied\r\ngreatly in different provinces. In Smolensk, for example, it was only\r\nabout thirty per cent., whilst in Samara it was 436, and in Viatka,\r\nwhere the peasant element predominates, no less than 1,262 per cent.!\r\nIn order to meet this increase, the rates on land rose from under ten\r\nmillions in 1868 to over forty-seven millions in 1900. No wonder that\r\nthe landowners who find it difficult to work their estates at a profit\r\nshould complain!\r\n\r\nThough this increase is disagreeable to the rate-payers, it does not\r\nfollow that it is excessive. In all countries rates and local taxation\r\nare on the increase, and it is in the backward countries that they\r\nincrease most rapidly. In France, for example, the average yearly\r\nincrease has been 2.7 per cent., while in Austria it has been 5.59. In\r\nRussia it ought to have been more than in Austria, whereas it has been,\r\nin the provinces with Zemstvo institutions, only about 4 per cent. In\r\ncomparison with the Imperial taxation the local does not seem excessive\r\nwhen compared with other countries. In England and Prussia, for\r\ninstance, the State taxation as compared with the local is as a hundred\r\nto fifty-four and fifty-one, whilst in Russia it is as a hundred\r\nto sixteen.* A reduction in the taxation as a whole would certainly\r\ncontribute to the material welfare of the rural population, but it is\r\ndesirable that it should be made in the Imperial taxes rather than\r\nin the rates, because the latter may be regarded as something akin to\r\nproductive investments, whilst the proceeds of the former are expended\r\nlargely on objects which have little or nothing to do with the wants\r\nof the common people. In speaking thus I am assuming that the local\r\nexpenditure is made judiciously, and this is a matter on which, I am\r\nbound to confess, there is by no means unanimity of opinion.\r\n\r\n     * These figures are taken from the best available\r\n     authorities, chiefly Schwanebach and Scalon, but I am not\r\n     prepared to guarantee their accuracy.\r\n\r\nHostile critics can point to facts which are, to say the least, strange\r\nand anomalous. Out of the total of its revenue the Zemstvo spends about\r\ntwenty-eight per cent. under the heading of public health and benevolent\r\ninstitutions; and about fifteen per cent. for popular education, whilst\r\nit devotes only about six per cent. to roads and bridges, and until\r\nlately it neglected, as I have said above, the means for improving\r\nagriculture and directly increasing the income of the peasantry.\r\n\r\nBefore passing sentence with regard to these charges we must remember\r\nthe circumstances in which the Zemstvo was founded and has grown up.\r\nIn the early times its members were well-meaning men who had had very\r\nlittle experience in administration or in practical life of any sort\r\nexcept the old routine in which they had previously vegetated. Most of\r\nthem had lived enough in the country to know how much the peasants were\r\nin need of medical assistance of the most elementary kind, and to this\r\nmatter they at once turned their attention. They tried to organise a\r\nsystem of doctors, hospital assistants, and dispensaries by which the\r\npeasant would not have to go more than fifteen or twenty miles to get a\r\nwound dressed or to have a consultation or to obtain a simple remedy\r\nfor ordinary ailments. They felt the necessity, too, of thoroughly\r\nreorganising the hospitals and the lunatic asylums, which were in a very\r\nunsatisfactory condition. Plainly enough, there was here good work to\r\nbe done. Then there were the higher aims. In the absence of practical\r\nexperience there were enthusiasms and theories. Amongst these was the\r\nenthusiasm for education, and the theory that the want of it was the\r\nchief reason why Russia had remained so far behind the nations of\r\nWestern Europe. Give us education, it was said, and all other good\r\nthings will be added thereto. Liberate the Russian people from the bonds\r\nof ignorance as you have liberated it from the bonds of serfage, and its\r\nwonderful natural capacities will then be able to create everything that\r\nis required for its material, intellectual, and moral welfare.\r\n\r\nIf there was any one among the leaders who took a more sober, prosaic\r\nview of things he was denounced as an ignoramus and a reactionary.\r\nWillingly or unwillingly, everybody had to swim with the current.\r\nRoads and bridges were not entirely neglected, but the efforts in\r\nthat direction were confined to the absolutely indispensable. For\r\nsuch prosaic concerns there was no enthusiasm, and it was universally\r\nrecognised that in Russia the construction of good roads, as the term\r\nis understood in Western Europe, was far beyond the resources of any\r\nAdministration. Of the necessity for such roads few were conscious.\r\nAll that was required was to make it possible to get from one place to\r\nanother in ordinary weather and ordinary circumstances. If a stream was\r\ntoo deep to be forded, a bridge had to be built or a ferry had to be\r\nestablished; and if the approach to a bridge was so marshy or muddy that\r\nvehicles often sank quite up to the axles and had to be dragged out by\r\nropes, with the assistance of the neighbouring villagers, repairs had\r\nto be made. Beyond this the efforts of the Zemstvo rarely went. Its\r\nroad-building ambition remained within very modest bounds.\r\n\r\nAs for the impoverishment of the peasantry and the necessity of\r\nimproving their system of agriculture, that question had hardly appeared\r\nabove the horizon. It might have to be dealt with in the future, but\r\nthere was no need for hurry. Once the rural population were educated,\r\nthe question would solve itself. It was not till about the year 1885\r\nthat it was recognised to be more urgent than had been supposed,\r\nand some Zemstvos perceived that the people might starve before its\r\npreparatory education was completed. Repeated famines pushed the lesson\r\nhome, and the landed proprietors found their revenues diminished by the\r\nfall in the price of grain on the European markets. Thus was raised the\r\ncry: \"Agriculture in Russia is on the decline! The country has entered\r\non an acute economic crisis! If energetic measures be not taken promptly\r\nthe people will soon find themselves confronted by starvation!\"\r\n\r\nTo this cry of alarm the Zemstvo was neither deaf nor indifferent.\r\nRecognising that the danger could be averted only by inducing the\r\npeasantry to adopt a more intensive system of agriculture, it directed\r\nmore and more of its attention to agricultural improvements, and tried\r\nto get them adopted.* It did, in short, all it could, according to its\r\nlights and within the limits of its moderate resources. Its available\r\nresources were small, unfortunately, for it was forbidden by the\r\nGovernment to increase the rates, and it could not well dismiss doctors\r\nand close dispensaries and schools when the people were clamouring for\r\nmore. So at least the defenders of the Zemstvo maintain, and they go\r\nso far as to contend that it did well not to grapple with the\r\nimpoverishment of the peasantry at an earlier period, when the real\r\nconditions of the problem and the means of solving it were only very\r\nimperfectly known: if it had begun at that time it would have made great\r\nblunders and spent much money to little purpose.\r\n\r\n     * Vide supra, p. 489.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it would certainly be unfair to condemn the Zemstvo\r\nfor not being greatly in advance of public opinion. If it endeavours\r\nstrenuously to supply all clearly recognised wants, that is all that can\r\nreasonably be expected of it. What it may be more justly reproached with\r\nis, in my opinion, that it is, to a certain extent, imbued with that\r\nunpractical, pedantic spirit which is commonly supposed to reside\r\nexclusively in the Imperial Administration. But here again it simply\r\nreflects public opinion and certain intellectual peculiarities of the\r\neducated classes. When a Russian begins to write on a simple everyday\r\nsubject, he likes to connect it with general principles, philosophy,\r\nor history, and begins, perhaps, by expounding his views on the\r\nintellectual and social developments of humanity in general and of\r\nRussia in particular. If he has sufficient space at his disposal he\r\nmay even tell you something about the early period of Russian history\r\nprevious to the Mongol invasion before he gets to the simple matter in\r\nhand. In a previous chapter I have described the process of \"shedding\r\non a subject the light of science\" in Imperial legislation.* In Zemstvo\r\nactivity we often meet with pedantry of a similar kind.\r\n\r\n     * Vide supra, p. 343.\r\n\r\nIf this pedantry were confined to the writing of Reports it might not do\r\nmuch harm. Unfortunately, it often appears in the sphere of action.\r\nTo illustrate this I take a recent instance from the province of\r\nNizhni-Novgorod. The Zemstvo of that province received from the Central\r\nGovernment in 1895 a certain amount of capital for road-improvement,\r\nwith instructions from the Ministry of Interior that it should classify\r\nthe roads according to their relative importance and improve them\r\naccordingly. Any intelligent person well acquainted with the region\r\nmight have made, in the course of a week or two, the required\r\nclassification accurately enough for all practical purposes. Instead of\r\nadopting this simple procedure, what does the Zemstvo do? It chooses one\r\nof the eleven districts of which the province is composed and instructs\r\nits statistical department to describe all the villages with a view of\r\ndetermining the amount of traffic which each will probably contribute to\r\nthe general movement, and then it verifies its a priori conclusions by\r\nmeans of a detachment of specially selected \"registrars,\" posted at all\r\nthe crossways during six days of each month. These registrars doubtless\r\ninscribed every peasant cart as it passed and made a rough estimate of\r\nthe weight of its load. When this complicated and expensive procedure\r\nwas completed for one district it was applied to another; but at the end\r\nof three years, before all the villages of this second district had\r\nbeen described and the traffic estimated, the energy of the statistical\r\ndepartment seems to have flagged, and, like a young author impatient to\r\nsee himself in print, it published a volume at the public expense which\r\nno one will ever read.\r\n\r\nThe cost entailed by this procedure is not known, but we may form some\r\nidea of the amount of time required for the whole operation. It is a\r\nsimple rule-of-three sum. If it took three years for the preparatory\r\ninvestigation of a district and a half, how many years will be required\r\nfor eleven districts? More than twenty years! During that period it\r\nwould seem that the roads are to remain as they are, and when the moment\r\ncomes for improving them it will be found that, unless the province is\r\ncondemned to economic stagnation, the \"valuable statistical material\"\r\ncollected at such an expenditure of time and money is in great part\r\nantiquated and useless. The statistical department will be compelled,\r\ntherefore, like another unfortunate Sisyphus, to begin the work anew,\r\nand it is difficult to see how the Zemstvo, unless it becomes a little\r\nmore practical, is ever to get out of the vicious circle.\r\n\r\nIn this case the evil result of pedantry was simply unnecessary delay,\r\nand in the meantime the capital was accumulating, unless the interest\r\nwas entirely swallowed up by the statistical researches; but there\r\nare cases in which the consequences are more serious. Let me take an\r\nillustration from the enlightened province of Moscow. It was observed\r\nthat certain villages were particularly unhealthy, and it was pointed\r\nout by a local doctor that the inhabitants were in the habit of\r\nusing for domestic purposes the water of ponds which were in a filthy\r\ncondition. What was evidently wanted was good wells, and a practical man\r\nwould at once have taken measures to have them dug. Not so the District\r\nZemstvo. It at once transformed the simple fact into a \"question\"\r\nrequiring scientific investigation. A commission was appointed to\r\nstudy the problem, and after much deliberation it was decided to make\r\na geological survey in order to ascertain the depth of good water\r\nthroughout the district as a preparatory step towards preparing a\r\nproject which will some day be discussed in the District Assembly, and\r\nperhaps in the Assembly of the province. Whilst all this is being\r\ndone according to the strict principles of bureaucratic procedure, the\r\nunfortunate peasants for whose benefit the investigation was undertaken\r\ncontinue to drink the muddy water of the dirty ponds.\r\n\r\nIncidents of that kind, which I might multiply almost to any extent,\r\nremind one of the proverbial formalism of the Chinese; but between\r\nChinese and Russian pedantry there is an essential difference. In the\r\nMiddle Kingdom the sacrifice of practical considerations proceeds from\r\nan exaggerated veneration of the wisdom of ancestors; in the Empire of\r\nthe Tsars it is due to an exaggerated adoration of the goddess Nauka\r\n(Science) and a habit of appealing to abstract principles and scientific\r\nmethods when only a little plain common-sense is required.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, I remember, in a District Assembly of the province\r\nof Riazan, when the subject of primary schools was being discussed, an\r\ninfluential member started up, and proposed that an obligatory system\r\nof education should at once be introduced throughout the whole district.\r\nStrange to say, the motion was very nearly carried, though all the\r\nmembers present knew--or at least might have known if they had taken the\r\ntrouble to inquire--that the actual number of schools would have to be\r\nmultiplied twenty-fold, and all were agreed that the local rates\r\nmust not be increased. To preserve his reputation for liberalism, the\r\nhonourable member further proposed that, though the system should be\r\nobligatory, no fines, punishments, or other means of compulsion should\r\nbe employed. How a system could be obligatory without using some means\r\nof compulsion, he did not condescend to explain. To get out of the\r\ndifficulty one of his supporters suggested that the peasants who did\r\nnot send their children to school should be excluded from serving as\r\noffice-bearers in the Communes; but this proposition merely created\r\na laugh, for many deputies knew that the peasants would regard this\r\nsupposed punishment as a valuable privilege. And whilst this discussion\r\nabout the necessity of introducing an ideal system of obligatory\r\neducation was being carried on, the street before the windows of the\r\nroom was covered with a stratum of mud nearly two feet in depth! The\r\nother streets were in a similar condition; and a large number of the\r\nmembers always arrived late, because it was almost impossible to come on\r\nfoot, and there was only one public conveyance in the town. Many\r\nmembers had, fortunately, their private conveyances, but even in these\r\nlocomotion was by no means easy. One day, in the principal thoroughfare,\r\na member had his tarantass overturned, and he himself was thrown into\r\nthe mud!\r\n\r\nIt is hardly fair to compare the Zemstvo with the older institutions\r\nof a similar kind in Western Europe, and especially with our own local\r\nself-government. Our institutions have all grown out of real, practical\r\nwants keenly felt by a large section of the population. Cautious and\r\nconservative in all that concerns the public welfare, we regard change\r\nas a necessary evil, and put off the evil day as long as possible, even\r\nwhen convinced that it must inevitably come. Thus our administrative\r\nwants are always in advance of our means of satisfying them, and we\r\nuse vigorously those means as soon as they are supplied. Our method of\r\nsupplying the means, too, is peculiar. Instead of making a tabula rasa,\r\nand beginning from the foundations, we utilise to the utmost what we\r\nhappen to possess, and add merely what is absolutely indispensable.\r\nMetaphorically speaking, we repair and extend our political edifice\r\naccording to the changing necessities of our mode of life, without\r\npaying much attention to abstract principles or the contingencies of the\r\ndistant future. The building may be an aesthetic monstrosity, belonging\r\nto no recognised style of architecture, and built in defiance of the\r\nprinciples laid down by philosophical art critics, but it is well\r\nadapted to our requirements, and every hole and corner of it is sure to\r\nbe utilised.\r\n\r\nVery different has been the political history of Russia during the last\r\ntwo centuries. It may be briefly described as a series of revolutions\r\neffected peaceably by the Autocratic Power. Each young energetic\r\nsovereign has attempted to inaugurate a new epoch by thoroughly\r\nremodelling the Administration according to the most approved foreign\r\npolitical philosophy of the time. Institutions have not been allowed\r\nto grow spontaneously out of popular wants, but have been invented by\r\nbureaucratic theorists to satisfy wants of which the people were still\r\nunconscious. The administrative machine has therefore derived little or\r\nno motive force from the people, and has always been kept in motion by\r\nthe unaided energy of the Central Government. Under these circumstances\r\nit is not surprising that the repeated attempts of the Government to\r\nlighten the burdens of centralised administration by creating organs of\r\nlocal self-government should not have been very successful.\r\n\r\nThe Zemstvo, it is true, offered better chances of success than any of\r\nits predecessors. A large portion of the nobles had become alive to the\r\nnecessity of improving the administration, and the popular interest in\r\npublic affairs was much greater than at any former period. Hence there\r\nwas at first a period of enthusiasm, during which great preparations\r\nwere made for future activity, and not a little was actually effected.\r\nThe institution had all the charm of novelty, and the members felt that\r\nthe eyes of the public were upon them. For a time all went well, and\r\nthe Zemstvo was so well pleased with its own activity that the satirical\r\njournals compared it to Narcissus admiring his image reflected in the\r\npool. But when the charm of novelty had passed and the public turned its\r\nattention to other matters, the spasmodic energy evaporated, and many of\r\nthe most active members looked about for more lucrative employment.\r\nSuch employment was easily found, for at that time there was an unusual\r\ndemand for able, energetic, educated men. Several branches of the civil\r\nservice were being reorganised, and railways, banks, and joint-stock\r\ncompanies were being rapidly multiplied. With these the Zemstvo had\r\ngreat difficulty in competing. It could not, like the Imperial service,\r\noffer pensions, decorations, and prospects of promotion, nor could it\r\npay such large salaries as the commercial and industrial enterprises.\r\nIn consequence of all this, the quality of the executive bureaux\r\ndeteriorated at the same time as the public interest in the institution\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nTo be just to the Zemstvo, I must add that, with all its defects and\r\nerrors, it is infinitely better than the institutions which it replaced.\r\nIf we compare it with previous attempts to create local self-government,\r\nwe must admit that the Russians have made great progress in their\r\npolitical education. What its future may be I do not venture to predict.\r\nFrom its infancy it has had, as we have seen, the ambition to play a\r\ngreat political part, and at the beginning of the recent stirring times\r\nin St. Petersburg its leading representatives in conclave assembled took\r\nupon themselves to express what they considered the national demand for\r\nliberal representative institutions. The desire, which had previously\r\nfrom time to time been expressed timidly and vaguely in loyal addresses\r\nto the Tsar, that a central Zemstvo Assembly, bearing the ancient title\r\nof Zemski Sobor, should be convoked in the capital and endowed with\r\npolitical functions, was now put forward by the representatives in plain\r\nunvarnished form. Whether this desire is destined to be realised time\r\nwill show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW LAW COURTS\r\n\r\n\r\nJudicial Procedure in the Olden Times--Defects and Abuses--Radical\r\nReform--The New System--Justices of the Peace and Monthly Sessions--The\r\nRegular Tribunals--Court of Revision--Modification of the Original\r\nPlan--How Does the System Work?--Rapid Acclimatisation--The Bench--The\r\nJury--Acquittal of Criminals Who Confess Their Crimes--Peasants,\r\nMerchants, and Nobles as Jurymen--Independence and Political\r\nSignificance of the New Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter serf-emancipation and local self-government, the subject which\r\ndemanded most urgently the attention of reformers was the judicial\r\norganisation, which had sunk to a depth of inefficiency and corruption\r\ndifficult to describe.\r\n\r\nIn early times the dispensation of justice in Russia, as in other States\r\nof a primitive type, had a thoroughly popular character. The State\r\nwas still in its infancy, and the duty of defending the person, the\r\nproperty, and the rights of individuals lay, of necessity, chiefly on\r\nthe individuals themselves. Self-help formed the basis of the judicial\r\nprocedure, and the State merely assisted the individual to protect his\r\nrights and to avenge himself on those who voluntarily infringed them.\r\n\r\nBy the rapid development of the Autocratic Power all this was changed.\r\nAutocracy endeavoured to drive and regulate the social machine by\r\nits own unaided force, and regarded with suspicion and jealousy all\r\nspontaneous action in the people. The dispensation of justice was\r\naccordingly appropriated by the central authority, absorbed into the\r\nAdministration, and withdrawn from public control. Themis retired\r\nfrom the market-place, shut herself up in a dark room from which\r\nthe contending parties and the public gaze were rigorously excluded,\r\nsurrounded herself with secretaries and scribes who put the rights and\r\nclaims of the litigants into whatever form they thought proper, weighed\r\naccording to her own judgment the arguments presented to her by her\r\nown servants, and came forth from her seclusion merely to present a\r\nready-made decision or to punish the accused whom she considered guilty.\r\n\r\nThis change, though perhaps to some extent necessary, was attended with\r\nvery bad consequences. Freed from the control of the contending parties\r\nand of the public, the courts acted as uncontrolled human nature\r\ngenerally does. Injustice, extortion, bribery, and corruption assumed\r\ngigantic proportions, and against these evils the Government found no\r\nbetter remedy than a system of complicated formalities and ingenious\r\nchecks. The judicial functionaries were hedged in by a multitude of\r\nregulations, so numerous and complicated that it seemed impossible\r\nfor even the most unjust judge to swerve from the path of uprightness.\r\nExplicit, minute rules were laid down for investigating facts and\r\nweighing evidence; every scrap of evidence and every legal ground on\r\nwhich the decision was based were committed to writing; every act in the\r\ncomplicated process of coming to a decision was made the subject of a\r\nformal document, and duly entered in various registers; every document\r\nand register had to be signed and countersigned by various officials who\r\nwere supposed to control each other; every decision might be carried to\r\na higher court and made to pass a second time through the bureaucratic\r\nmachine. In a word, the legislature introduced a system of formal\r\nwritten procedure of the most complicated kind, in the belief that by\r\nthis means mistakes and dishonesty would be rendered impossible.\r\n\r\nIt may be reasonably doubted whether this system of judicial\r\nadministration can anywhere give satisfactory results. It is everywhere\r\nfound by experience that in tribunals from which the healthy atmosphere\r\nof publicity is excluded justice languishes, and a great many ugly\r\nplants shoot up with wonderful vitality. Languid indifference, an\r\nindiscriminating spirit of routine, and unblushing dishonesty invariably\r\ncreep in through the little chinks and crevices of the barrier raised\r\nagainst them, and no method of hermetically sealing these chinks\r\nand crevices has yet been invented. The attempt to close them up by\r\nincreasing the formalities and multiplying the courts of appeal and\r\nrevision merely adds to the tediousness of the procedure, and withdraws\r\nthe whole process still more completely from public control. At the\r\nsame time the absence of free discussion between the contending parties\r\nrenders the task of the judge enormously difficult. If the system is\r\nto succeed at all, it must provide a body of able, intelligent,\r\nthoroughly-trained jurists, and must place them beyond the reach of\r\nbribery and other forms of corruption.\r\n\r\nIn Russia neither of these conditions was fulfilled. Instead of\r\nendeavouring to create a body of well-trained jurists, the Government\r\nwent further and further in the direction of letting the judges be\r\nchosen for a short period by popular election from among men who had\r\nnever received a juridical education, or a fair education of any kind;\r\nwhilst the place of judge was so poorly paid, and stood so low in public\r\nestimation, that the temptations to dishonesty were difficult to resist.\r\n\r\nThe practice of choosing the judges by popular election was an attempt\r\nto restore to the courts something of their old popular character; but\r\nit did not succeed, for very obvious reasons. Popular election in a\r\njudicial organisation is useful only when the courts are public and the\r\nprocedure simple; on the contrary, it is positively prejudicial when the\r\nprocedure is in writing and extremely complicated. And so it proved in\r\nRussia. The elected judges, unprepared for their work, and liable to\r\nbe changed at short intervals, rarely acquired a knowledge of law\r\nor procedure. They were for the most part poor, indolent landed\r\nproprietors, who did little more than sign the decisions prepared for\r\nthem by the permanent officials. Even when a judge happened to have some\r\nlegal knowledge he found small scope for its application, for he rarely,\r\nif ever, examined personally the materials out of which a decision\r\nwas to be elaborated. The whole of the preliminary work, which was in\r\nreality the most important, was performed by minor officials under\r\nthe direction of the secretary of the court. In criminal cases, for\r\ninstance, the secretary examined the written evidence--all evidence\r\nwas taken down in writing--extracted what he considered the essential\r\npoints, arranged them as he thought proper, quoted the laws which ought\r\nin his opinion to be applied, put all this into a report, and read the\r\nreport to the judges. Of course the judges, if they had no personal\r\ninterest in the decision, accepted the secretary\u0027s view of the case.\r\nIf they did not, all the preliminary work had to be done anew by\r\nthemselves--a task that few judges were able, and still fewer willing,\r\nto perform. Thus the decision lay virtually in the hands of the\r\nsecretary and the minor officials, and in general neither the secretary\r\nnor the minor officials were fit persons to have such power. There is\r\nno need to detail here the ingenious expedients by which they increased\r\ntheir meagre salaries, and how they generally contrived to extract money\r\nfrom both parties.* Suffice it to say that in general the chancelleries\r\nof the courts were dens of pettifogging rascality, and the habitual,\r\nunblushing bribery had a negative as well as a positive effect. If a\r\nperson accused of some crime had no money wherewith to grease the palm\r\nof the secretary he might remain in prison for years without being\r\nbrought to trial. A well-known Russian writer still living relates that\r\nwhen visiting a prison in the province of Nizhni-Novgorod he found among\r\nthe inmates undergoing preliminary arrest two peasant women, who were\r\naccused of setting fire to a hayrick to revenge themselves on a landed\r\nproprietor, a crime for which the legal punishment was from four to\r\neight months\u0027 imprisonment. One of them had a son of seven years of age,\r\nand the other a son of twelve, both of whom had been born in the\r\nprison, and had lived there ever since among the criminals. Such a long\r\npreliminary arrest caused no surprise or indignation among those who\r\nheard of it, because it was quite a common occurrence. Every one knew\r\nthat bribes were taken not only by the secretary and his scribes, but\r\nalso by the judges, who were elected by the local Noblesse from its own\r\nranks.\r\n\r\n     * Old book-catalogues sometimes mention a play bearing the\r\n     significant title, \"The Unheard-of Wonder; or, The Honest\r\n     Secretary\" (Neslykhannoe Dyelo ili Tchestny Sekretar).  I\r\n     have never seen this curious production, but I have no doubt\r\n     that it referred to the peculiarities of the old judicial\r\n     procedure.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the scale of punishments, notwithstanding some\r\nhumanitarian principles in the legislation, they were very severe, and\r\ncorporal punishment played amongst them a disagreeably prominent part.\r\nCapital sentences were abolished as early as 1753-54, but castigation\r\nwith the knout, which often ended fatally, continued until 1845, when\r\nit was replaced by flogging in the civil administration, though retained\r\nfor the military and for insubordinate convicts. For the non-privileged\r\nclasses the knout or the lash supplemented nearly all punishments of\r\na criminal kind. When a man was condemned, for example, to penal\r\nservitude, he received publicly from thirty to one hundred lashes,\r\nand was then branded on the forehead and cheeks with the letters K. A.\r\nT.--the first three letters of katorzhnik (convict). If he appealed he\r\nreceived his lashes all the same, and if his appeal was rejected by\r\nthe Senate he received some more castigation for having troubled\r\nunnecessarily the higher judicial authorities. For the military\r\nand insubordinate convicts there was a barbarous punishment called\r\nSpitsruten, to the extent of 5,000 or 6,000 blows, which often ended in\r\nthe death of the unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe use of torture in criminal investigations was formally abolished in\r\n1801, but if we may believe the testimony of a public prosecutor, it was\r\noccasionally used in Moscow as late as 1850.\r\n\r\nThe defects and abuses of the old system were so flagrant that they\r\nbecame known even to the Emperor Nicholas I., and caused him momentary\r\nindignation, but he never attempted seriously to root them out. In 1844,\r\nfor example, he heard of some gross abuses in a tribunal not far from\r\nthe Winter Palace, and ordered an investigation. Baron Korff, to whom\r\nthe investigation was entrusted, brought to light what he called \"a\r\nyawning abyss of all possible horrors, which have been accumulating for\r\nyears,\" and his Majesty, after reading the report, wrote upon it with\r\nhis own hand: \"Unheard-of disgrace! The carelessness of the authority\r\nimmediately concerned is incredible and unpardonable. I feel ashamed\r\nand sad that such disorder could exist almost under my eyes and remain\r\nunknown to me.\" Unfortunately the outburst of Imperial indignation did\r\nnot last long enough to produce any desirable consequences. The only\r\nresult was that one member of the tribunal was dismissed from the\r\nservice, and the Governor-General of St. Petersburg had to resign, but\r\nthe latter subsequently received an honorary reward, and the\r\nEmperor remarked that he was himself to blame for having kept the\r\nGovernor-General so long at his post.\r\n\r\nWhen his Majesty\u0027s habitual optimism happened to be troubled by\r\nincidents of this sort he probably consoled himself with remembering\r\nthat he had ordered some preparatory work, by which the administration\r\nof justice might be improved, and this work was being diligently carried\r\nout in the legislative section of his own chancery by Count Bludof, one\r\nof the ablest Russian lawyers of his time. Unfortunately the existing\r\nstate of things was not thereby improved, because the preparatory work\r\nwas not of the kind that was wanted. On the assumption that any evil\r\nwhich might exist could be removed by improving the laws, Count Bludof\r\ndevoted his efforts almost entirely to codification. In reality what was\r\nrequired was to change radically the organisation of the courts and the\r\nprocedure, and above all to let in on their proceedings the cleansing\r\natmosphere of publicity. This the Emperor Nicholas could not understand,\r\nand if he had understood it he could not have brought himself to\r\nadopt the appropriate remedies, because radical reform and control of\r\nofficials by public opinion were his two pet bugbears.\r\n\r\nVery different was his son and successor, Alexander II., in the first\r\nyears of his reign. In his accession manifesto a prominent place was\r\ngiven to his desire that justice and mercy should reign in the courts\r\nof law. Referring to these words in a later manifesto, he explained his\r\nwishes more fully as \"the desire to establish in Russia expeditious,\r\njust, merciful, impartial courts of justice for all our subjects; to\r\nraise the judicial authority; to give it the proper independence, and in\r\ngeneral to implant in the people that respect for the law which ought\r\nto be the constant guide of all and every one from the highest to the\r\nlowest.\" These were not mere vain words. Peremptory orders had been\r\ngiven that the great work should be undertaken without delay, and\r\nwhen the Emancipation question was being discussed in the Provincial\r\nCommittees, the Council of State examined the question of judicial\r\nreform \"from the historical, the theoretical, and the practical point of\r\nview,\" and came to the conclusion that the existing organisation must be\r\ncompletely transformed.\r\n\r\nThe commission appointed to consider this important matter filed a\r\nlengthy indictment against the existing system, and pointed out no less\r\nthan twenty-five radical defects. To remove these it proposed that the\r\njudicial organisation should be completely separated from all other\r\nbranches of the Administration; that the most ample publicity,\r\nwith trial by jury in criminal cases, should be introduced into the\r\ntribunals; that Justice of Peace Courts should be created for petty\r\naffairs; and that the procedure in the ordinary courts should be greatly\r\nsimplified.\r\n\r\nThese fundamental principles were published by Imperial command on\r\nSeptember 29th, 1862--a year and a half after the publication of the\r\nEmancipation Manifesto--and on November 20th, 1864, the new legislation\r\nfounded on these principles received the Imperial sanction.\r\n\r\nLike most institutions erected on a tabula rasa, the new system is at\r\nonce simple and symmetrical. As a whole, the architecture of the edifice\r\nis decidedly French, but here and there we may detect unmistakable\r\nsymptoms of English influence. It is not, however, a servile copy of any\r\nolder edifice; and it may be fairly said that, though every individual\r\npart has been fashioned according to a foreign model, the whole has a\r\ncertain originality.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the building in its original form was composed of two\r\ngreat sections, distinct from, and independent of, each other--on the\r\none hand the Justice of Peace Courts, and on the other the Regular\r\nTribunals. Both sections contained an Ordinary Court and a Court of\r\nAppeal. The upper part of the building, covering equally both sections,\r\nwas the Senate as Supreme Court of Revision (Cour de Cassation).\r\n\r\nThe distinctive character of the two independent sections may be\r\ndetected at a glance. The function of the Justice of Peace Courts is\r\nto decide petty cases that involve no abstruse legal principles, and to\r\nsettle, if possible by conciliation, those petty conflicts and disputes\r\nwhich arise naturally in the relations of everyday life; the function of\r\nthe Regular Tribunals is to take cognisance of those graver affairs in\r\nwhich the fortune or honour of individuals or families is more or less\r\nimplicated, or in which the public tranquillity is seriously endangered.\r\nThe two kinds of courts were organised in accordance with these intended\r\nfunctions. In the former the procedure is simple and conciliatory, the\r\njurisdiction is confined to cases of little importance, and the judges\r\nwere at first chosen by popular election, generally from among the local\r\ninhabitants. In the latter there is more of \"the pomp and majesty of\r\nthe law.\" The procedure is more strict and formal, the jurisdiction is\r\nunlimited with regard to the importance of the cases, and the judges are\r\ntrained jurists nominated by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Justice of Peace Courts received jurisdiction over all obligations\r\nand civil injuries in which the sum at stake was not more than 500\r\nroubles--about 50 pounds--and all criminal affairs in which the legal\r\npunishment did not exceed 300 roubles--about 30 pounds--or one year of\r\npunishment. When any one had a complaint to make, he might go to the\r\nJustice of the Peace (Mirovoi Sudya) and explain the affair orally,\r\nor in writing, without observing any formalities; and if the complaint\r\nseemed well founded, the Justice at once fixed a day for hearing the\r\ncase, and gave the other party notice to appear at the appointed time.\r\nWhen the time appointed arrived, the affair was discussed publicly and\r\norally, either by the parties themselves, or by any representatives\r\nwhom they might appoint. If it was a civil suit, the Justice began by\r\nproposing to the parties to terminate it at once by a compromise, and\r\nindicated what he considered a fair arrangement. Many affairs were\r\nterminated in this simple way. If, however, either of the parties\r\nrefused to consent to a compromise, the matter was fully discussed, and\r\nthe Justice gave a formal written decision, containing the grounds\r\non which it was based. In criminal cases the amount of punishment was\r\nalways determined by reference to a special Criminal Code.\r\n\r\nIf the sum at issue exceeded thirty roubles--about 3 pounds--or if the\r\npunishment exceeded a fine of fifteen roubles--about 30s.--or three days\r\nof arrest, an appeal might be made to the Assembly of Justices (Mirovoi\r\nSyezd). This is a point in which English rather than French institutions\r\nwere taken as a model. According to the French system, all appeals from\r\na Juge de Paix are made to the \"Tribunal d\u0027Arrondissement,\" and\r\nthe Justice of Peace Courts are thereby subordinated to the Regular\r\nTribunals. According to the English system, certain cases may be carried\r\non appeal from the Justice of the Peace to the Quarter Sessions. This\r\nlatter principle was adopted and greatly developed by the Russian\r\nlegislation. The Monthly Sessions, composed of all the Justices of\r\nthe District (uyezd), considered appeals against the decisions of the\r\nindividual Justices. The procedure was simple and informal, as in the\r\nlower court, but an assistant of the Procureur was always present. This\r\nfunctionary gave his opinion in some civil and in all criminal cases\r\nimmediately after the debate, and the Court took his opinion into\r\nconsideration in framing its judgment.\r\n\r\nIn the other great section of the judicial organisation--the Regular\r\nTribunals--there are likewise Ordinary Courts and Courts of Appeal,\r\ncalled respectively \"Tribunaux d\u0027Arrondissement\" (Okruzhniye Sudy)\r\nand \"Palais de Justice\" (Sudebniya Palaty). Each Ordinary Court has\r\njurisdiction over several Districts (uyezdy), and the jurisdiction of\r\neach Court of Appeals comprehends several Provinces. All civil cases are\r\nsubject to appeal, however small the sum at stake may be, but criminal\r\ncases are decided FINALLY by the lower court with the aid of a jury.\r\nThus in criminal affairs the \"Palais de Justice\" is not at all a court\r\nof appeal, but as no regular criminal prosecution can be raised without\r\nits formal consent, it controls in some measure the action of the lower\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nAs the general reader cannot be supposed to take an interest in the\r\ndetails of civil procedure, I shall merely say on this subject that in\r\nboth sections of the Regular Tribunals the cases are always tried by\r\nat least three judges, the sittings are public, and oral debates\r\nby officially recognised advocates form an important part of the\r\nproceedings. I venture, however, to speak a little more at length\r\nregarding the change which has been made in the criminal procedure--a\r\nsubject that is less technical and more interesting for the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nDown to the time of the recent judicial reforms the procedure in\r\ncriminal cases was secret and inquisitorial. The accused had little\r\nopportunity of defending himself, but, on the other hand, the State\r\ntook endless formal precautions against condemning the innocent. The\r\npractical consequence of this system was that an innocent man might\r\nremain for years in prison until the authorities convinced themselves of\r\nhis innocence, whilst a clever criminal might indefinitely postpone his\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nIn studying the history of criminal procedure in foreign countries,\r\nthose who were entrusted with the task of preparing projects of reform\r\nfound that nearly every country of Europe had experienced the evils from\r\nwhich Russia was suffering, and that one country after another had come\r\nto the conviction that the most efficient means of removing these evils\r\nwas to replace the inquisitorial by litigious procedure, to give a fair\r\nfield and no favour to the prosecutor and the accused, and allow them to\r\nfight out their battle with whatever legal weapons they might think fit.\r\nFurther, it was discovered that, according to the most competent foreign\r\nauthorities, it was well in this modern form of judicial combat to leave\r\nthe decision to a jury of respectable citizens. The steps which Russia\r\nhad to take were thus clearly marked out by the experience of other\r\nnations, and it was decided that they should be taken at once. The\r\norgans for the prosecution of supposed criminals were carefully\r\nseparated from the judges on the one hand, and from the police on the\r\nother; oral discussions between the Public Prosecutor and the prisoner\u0027s\r\ncounsel, together with oral examination and cross-questioning of\r\nwitnesses, were introduced into the procedure; and the jury was made an\r\nessential factor in criminal trials.\r\n\r\nWhen a case, whether civil or criminal, has been decided in the Regular\r\nTribunals, there is no possibility of appeal in the strict sense of the\r\nterm, but an application may be made for a revision of the case on the\r\nground of technical informality. To use the French terms, there cannot\r\nbe appel, but there may be cassation. If there has been any omission\r\nor transgression of essential legal formalities, or if the Court has\r\noverstepped the bounds of its legal authority, the injured party may\r\nmake an application to have the case revised and tried again.* This is\r\nnot, according to French juridical conceptions, an appeal. The Court of\r\nRevision** (Cour de Cassation) does not enter into the material facts\r\nof the case, but merely decides the question as to whether the essential\r\nformalities have been duly observed, and as to whether the law has been\r\nproperly interpreted and applied; and if it be found on examination that\r\nthere is some ground for invalidating the decision, it does not decide\r\nthe case. According to the new Russian system, the sole Court of\r\nRevision is the Senate.\r\n\r\n     * This is the procedure referred to by Karl Karl\u0027itch, vide\r\n     supra, p 37.\r\n\r\n     ** I am quite aware that the term \"Court of Revision\" is\r\n     equivocal, but I have no better term to propose, and I hope\r\n     the above explanations will prevent confusion.\r\n\r\nThe Senate thus forms the regulator of the whole judicial system, but\r\nits action is merely regulative. It takes cognisance only of what is\r\npresented to it, and supplies to the machine no motive power. If any\r\nof the lower courts should work slowly or cease to work altogether, the\r\nSenate might remain ignorant of the fact, and certainly could take\r\nno official notice of it. It was considered necessary, therefore, to\r\nsupplement the spontaneous vitality of the lower courts, and for this\r\npurpose was created a special centralised judicial administration, at\r\nthe head of which was placed the Minister of Justice. The Minister is\r\n\"Procureur-General,\" and has subordinates in all the courts. The primary\r\nfunction of this administration is to preserve the force of the law,\r\nto detect and repair all infractions of judicial order, to defend\r\nthe interests of the State and of those persons who are officially\r\nrecognised as incapable of taking charge of their own affairs, and to\r\nact in criminal matters as Public Prosecutor.\r\n\r\nViewed as a whole, and from a little distance, this grand judicial\r\nedifice seems perfectly symmetrical, but a closer and more minute\r\ninspection brings to light unmistakable indications of a change of plan\r\nduring the process of construction. Though the work lasted only about\r\nhalf-a-dozen years, the style of the upper differs from the style of\r\nthe lower parts, precisely as in those Gothic cathedrals which grew up\r\nslowly during the course of centuries. And there is nothing here that\r\nneed surprise us, for a considerable change took place in the opinions\r\nof the official world during that short period. The reform was conceived\r\nat a time of uncritical enthusiasm for advanced liberal ideas, of\r\nboundless faith in the dictates of science, of unquestioning reliance\r\non public spirit, public control, and public honesty--a time in which it\r\nwas believed that the public would spontaneously do everything necessary\r\nfor the common weal, if it were only freed from the administrative\r\nswaddling-clothes in which it had been hitherto bound. Still smarting\r\nfrom the severe regime of Nicholas, men thought more about protecting\r\nthe rights of the individual than about preserving public order, and\r\nunder the influence of the socialistic ideas in vogue malefactors were\r\nregarded as the unfortunate, involuntary victims of social inequality\r\nand injustice.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the period in question all this had begun to change.\r\nMany were beginning to perceive that liberty might easily turn to\r\nlicense, that the spontaneous public energy was largely expended in\r\nempty words, and that a certain amount of hierarchical discipline was\r\nnecessary in order to keep the public administration in motion. It was\r\nfound, therefore, in 1864, that it was impossible to carry out to their\r\nultimate consequences the general principles laid down and published in\r\n1862. Even in those parts of the legislation which were actually put\r\nin force, it was found necessary to make modifications in an indirect,\r\ncovert way. Of these, one may be cited by way of illustration. In\r\n1860 criminal inquiries were taken out of the hands of the police and\r\ntransferred to Juges d\u0027instruction (Sudebniye Sledovateli), who were\r\nalmost entirely independent of the Public Prosecutor, and could not\r\nbe removed unless condemned for some legal transgression by a Regular\r\nTribunal. This reform created at first much rejoicing and great\r\nexpectations, because it raised a barrier against the tyranny of the\r\npolice and against the arbitrary power of the higher officials. But\r\nvery soon the defects of the system became apparent. Many Juges\r\nd\u0027instruction, feeling themselves independent, and knowing that they\r\nwould not be prosecuted except for some flagrantly illegal act, gave way\r\nto indolence, and spent their time in inactivity.* In such cases it\r\nwas always difficult, and sometimes impossible, to procure a\r\ncondemnation--for indolence must assume gigantic proportions in order\r\nto become a crime--and the minister had to adopt the practice of\r\nappointing, without Imperial confirmation, temporary Juges d\u0027instruction\r\nwhom he could remove at pleasure.\r\n\r\n     * A flagrant case of this kind came under my own\r\n     observation.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary, however, to enter into these theoretical defects. The\r\nimportant question for the general public is: How do the institutions\r\nwork in the local conditions in which they are placed?\r\n\r\nThis is a question which has an interest not only for Russians, but\r\nfor all students of social science, for it tends to throw light on\r\nthe difficult subject as to how far institutions may be successfully\r\ntransplanted to a foreign soil. Many thinkers hold, and not without\r\nreason, that no institution can work well unless it is the natural\r\nproduct of previous historical development. Now we have here an\r\nopportunity of testing this theory by experience; we have even what\r\nBacon terms an experimentum crucis. This new judicial system is an\r\nartificial creation constructed in accordance with principles laid down\r\nby foreign jurists. All that the elaborators of the project said about\r\ndeveloping old institutions was mere talk. In reality they made a tabula\r\nrasa of the existing organisation. If the introduction of public oral\r\nprocedure and trial by jury was a return to ancient customs, it was a\r\nreturn to what had been long since forgotten by all except antiquarian\r\nspecialists, and no serious attempt was made to develop what actually\r\nexisted. One form, indeed, of oral procedure had been preserved in the\r\nCode, but it had fallen completely into disuse, and seems to have been\r\noverlooked by the elaborators of the new system.*\r\n\r\n     * I refer to the so-called Sud po forme established by an\r\n     ukaz of Peter the Great, in 1723.  I was much astonished\r\n     when I accidentally stumbled upon it in the Code.\r\n\r\nHaving in general little confidence in institutions which spring\r\nready-made from the brains of autocratic legislators, I expected to find\r\nthat this new judicial organisation, which looks so well on paper, was\r\nwell-nigh worthless in reality. Observation, however, has not confirmed\r\nmy pessimistic expectations. On the contrary, I have found that these\r\nnew institutions, though they have not yet had time to strike deep root,\r\nand are very far from being perfect even in the human sense of the term,\r\nwork on the whole remarkably well, and have already conferred immense\r\nbenefit on the country.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few years the Justice of Peace Courts, which may\r\nperhaps be called the newest part of the new institutions, became\r\nthoroughly acclimatised, as if they had existed for generations. As\r\nsoon as they were opened they became extremely popular. In Moscow the\r\nauthorities had calculated that under the new system the number of cases\r\nwould be more than doubled, and that on an average each justice would\r\nhave nearly a thousand cases brought before him in the course of the\r\nyear. The reality far exceeded their expectations: each justice had on\r\nan average 2,800 cases. In St. Petersburg and the other large towns the\r\namount of work which the justices had to get through was equally great.\r\n\r\nTo understand the popularity of the Justice of Peace Courts, we must\r\nknow something of the old police courts which they supplanted. The\r\nnobles, the military, and the small officials had always looked on\r\nthe police with contempt, because their position secured them against\r\ninterference, and the merchants acquired a similar immunity by\r\nsubmitting to blackmail, which often took the form of a fixed subsidy;\r\nbut the lower classes in town and country stood, in fear of the humblest\r\npoliceman, and did not dare to complain of him to his superiors. If\r\ntwo workmen brought their differences before a police court, instead of\r\ngetting their case decided on grounds of equity, they were pretty sure\r\nto get scolded in language unfit for ears polite, or to receive still\r\nworse treatment. Even among the higher officers of the force many became\r\nfamous for their brutality. A Gorodnitchi of the town of Tcherkassy, for\r\nexample, made for himself in this respect a considerable reputation. If\r\nany humble individual ventured to offer an objection to him, he had at\r\nonce recourse to his fists, and any reference to the law put him into a\r\nstate of frenzy. \"The town,\" he was wont to say on such occasions, \"has\r\nbeen entrusted to me by his Majesty, and you dare to talk to me of the\r\nlaw? There is the law for you!\"--the remark being accompanied with a\r\nblow. Another officer of the same type, long resident in Kief, had a\r\nsomewhat different method of maintaining order. He habitually drove\r\nabout the town with a Cossack escort, and when any one of the lower\r\nclasses had the misfortune to displease him, he ordered one of his\r\nCossacks to apply a little corporal punishment on the spot without any\r\nlegal formalities.\r\n\r\nIn the Justice of Peace Courts things were conducted in a very different\r\nstyle. The justice, always scrupulously polite without distinction\r\nof persons, listened patiently to the complaint, tried to arrange the\r\naffairs amicably, and when his efforts failed, gave his decision at\r\nonce according to law and common-sense. No attention was paid to rank\r\nor social position. A general who would not attend to the police\r\nregulations was fined like an ordinary workingman, and in a dispute\r\nbetween a great dignitary and a man of the people the two were treated\r\nin precisely the same way. No wonder such courts became popular among\r\nthe masses; and their popularity was increased when it became known\r\nthat the affairs were disposed of expeditiously, without unnecessary\r\nformalities and without any bribes or blackmail. Many peasants regarded\r\nthe justice as they had been wont to regard kindly proprietors of the\r\nold patriarchal type, and brought their griefs and sorrows to him in\r\nthe hope that he would somehow alleviate them. Often they submitted\r\nmost intimate domestic and matrimonial concerns of which no court could\r\npossibly take cognisance, and sometimes they demanded the fulfilment of\r\ncontracts which were in flagrant contradiction not only with the written\r\nlaw, but also with ordinary morality.*\r\n\r\n     * Many curious instances of this have come to my knowledge,\r\n     but they are of such a kind that they cannot be quoted in a\r\n     work intended for the general public.\r\n\r\nOf course, the courts were not entirely without blemishes. In the\r\nmatter, for example, of making no distinction of persons some of the\r\nearly justices, in seeking to avoid Scylla, came dangerously near to\r\nCharybdis. Imagining that their mission was to eradicate the conceptions\r\nand habits which had been created and fostered by serfage, they\r\nsometimes used their authority for giving lessons in philanthropic\r\nliberalism, and took a malicious delight in wounding the\r\nsusceptibilities, and occasionally even the material interests, of those\r\nwhom they regarded as enemies to the good cause. In disputes between\r\nmaster and servant, or between employer and workmen, the justice of this\r\ntype considered it his duty to resist the tyranny of capital, and was\r\napt to forget his official character of judge in his assumed character\r\nof social reformer. Happily these aberrations on the part of the\r\njustices are already things of the past, but they helped to bring about\r\na reaction, as we shall see presently.\r\n\r\nThe extreme popularity of the Justice of Peace Courts did not last very\r\nlong. Their history resembled that of the Zemstvo and many other\r\nnew institutions in Russia--at first, enthusiasm and inordinate\r\nexpectations; then consciousness of defects and practical\r\ninconveniences; and, lastly, in an influential section of the public,\r\nthe pessimism of shattered illusions, accompanied by the adoption of\r\na reactionary policy on the part of the Government. The discontent\r\nappeared first among the so-called privileged classes. To people who had\r\nall their lives enjoyed great social consideration it seemed monstrous\r\nthat they should be treated exactly in the same way as the muzhik; and\r\nwhen a general who was accustomed to be addressed as \"Your Excellency,\"\r\nwas accused of using abusive language to his cook, and found himself\r\nseated on the same bench with the menial, he naturally supposed that the\r\nend of all things was at hand; or perhaps a great civil official, who\r\nwas accustomed to regard the police as created merely for the lower\r\nclasses, suddenly found himself, to his inexpressible astonishment,\r\nfined for a contravention of police regulations! Naturally the justices\r\nwere accused of dangerous revolutionary tendencies, and when they\r\nhappened to bring to light some injustice on the part of the tchinovnik\r\nthey were severely condemned for undermining the prestige of the\r\nImperial authority.\r\n\r\nFor a time the accusations provoked merely a smile or a caustic remark\r\namong the Liberals, but about the middle of the eighties criticisms\r\nbegan to appear even in the Liberal Press. No very grave allegations\r\nwere made, but defects in the system and miscarriages of justice were\r\nput forward and severely commented upon. Occasionally it happened that a\r\njustice was indolent, or that at the Sessions in a small country town\r\nit was impossible to form a quorum on the appointed day. Overlooking the\r\ngood features of the institution and the good services rendered by it,\r\nthe critics began to propose partial reorganisation in the sense of\r\ngreater control by central authorities. It was suggested, for example,\r\nthat the President of Sessions should be appointed by the Government,\r\nthat the justices should be subordinated to the Regular Tribunals, and\r\nthat the principle of election by the Zemstvo should be abolished.\r\n\r\nThese complaints were not at all unwelcome to the Government, because it\r\nhad embarked on a reactionary policy, and in 1889 it suddenly granted to\r\nthe critics a great deal more than they desired. In the rural districts\r\nof Central Russia the justices were replaced by the rural supervisors,\r\nof whom I have spoken in a previous chapter, and the part of their\r\nfunctions which could not well be entrusted to those new officials was\r\ntransferred to judges of the Regular Courts. In some of the larger\r\ntowns and in the rural districts of outlying provinces the justices\r\nwere preserved, but instead of being elected by the Zemstvo they were\r\nnominated by the Government.\r\n\r\nThe regular Tribunals likewise became acclimatised in an incredibly\r\nshort space of time. The first judges were not by any means profound\r\njurists, and were too often deficient in that dispassionate calmness\r\nwhich we are accustomed to associate with the Bench; but they were at\r\nleast honest, educated men, and generally possessed a fair knowledge of\r\nthe law. Their defects were due to the fact that the demand for trained\r\njurists far exceeded the supply, and the Government was forced to\r\nnominate men who under ordinary circumstances would never have thought\r\nof presenting themselves as candidates. At the beginning of 1870, in\r\nthe 32 \"Tribunaux d\u0027Arrondissement\" which then existed, there were 227\r\njudges, of whom 44 had never received a juridical education. Even the\r\npresidents had not all passed through a school of law. Of course the\r\ncourts could not become thoroughly effective until all the judges\r\nwere men who had received a good special education and had a practical\r\nacquaintance with judicial matters. This has now been effected, and the\r\npresent generation of judges are better prepared and more capable than\r\ntheir predecessors. On the score of probity I have never heard any\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nOf all the judicial innovations, perhaps the most interesting is the\r\njury.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the reforms the introduction of the jury into the\r\njudicial organisation awakened among the educated classes a great amount\r\nof sentimental enthusiasm. The institution had the reputation of being\r\n\"liberal,\" and was known to be approved of by the latest authorities in\r\ncriminal jurisprudence. This was sufficient to insure it a favourable\r\nreception, and to excite most exaggerated expectations as to its\r\nbeneficent influence. Ten years of experience somewhat cooled this\r\nenthusiasm, and voices might be heard declaring that the introduction\r\nof the jury was a mistake. The Russian people, it was held, was not yet\r\nripe for such an institution, and numerous anecdotes were related\r\nin support of this opinion. One jury, for instance, was said to have\r\nreturned a verdict of \"NOT guilty with extenuating circumstances\"; and\r\nanother, being unable to come to a decision, was reported to have cast\r\nlots before an Icon, and to have given a verdict in accordance with the\r\nresult! Besides this, juries often gave a verdict of \"not guilty\" when\r\nthe accused made a full and formal confession to the court.\r\n\r\nHow far the comic anecdotes are true I do not undertake to decide, but I\r\nventure to assert that such incidents, if they really occur, are too\r\nfew to form the basis of a serious indictment. The fact, however, that\r\njuries often acquit prisoners who openly confess their crime is beyond\r\nall possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\nTo most Englishmen this fact will probably seem sufficient to prove that\r\nthe introduction of the institution was at least premature, but before\r\nadopting this sweeping conclusion it will be well to examine the\r\nphenomenon a little more closely in connection with Russian criminal\r\nprocedure as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn England the Bench is allowed very great latitude in fixing the amount\r\nof punishment. The jury can therefore confine themselves to the\r\nquestion of fact and leave to the judge the appreciation of extenuating\r\ncircumstances. In Russia the position of the jury is different. The\r\nRussian criminal law fixes minutely the punishment for each category of\r\ncrimes, and leaves almost no latitude to the judge. The jury know\r\nthat if they give a verdict of guilty, the prisoner will inevitably be\r\npunished according to the Code. Now the Code, borrowed in great part\r\nfrom foreign legislation, is founded on conceptions very different\r\nfrom those of the Russian people, and in many cases it attaches heavy\r\npenalties to acts which the ordinary Russian is wont to regard as mere\r\npeccadilloes, or positively justifiable. Even in those matters in\r\nwhich the Code is in harmony with the popular morality, there are many\r\nexceptional cases in which summum jus is really summa injuria. Suppose,\r\nfor instance--as actually happened in a case which came under my\r\nnotice--that a fire breaks out in a village, and that the Village Elder,\r\ndriven out of patience by the apathy and laziness of some of his young\r\nfellow-villagers, oversteps the limits of his authority as defined by\r\nlaw, and accompanies his reproaches and exhortations with a few\r\nlusty blows. Surely such a man is not guilty of a very heinous\r\ncrime--certainly he is not in the opinion of the peasantry--and yet if\r\nhe be prosecuted and convicted he inevitably falls into the jaws of an\r\narticle of the Code which condemns to transportation for a long term of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn such cases what is the jury to do? In England they might safely give\r\na verdict of guilty, and leave the judge to take into consideration all\r\nthe extenuating circumstances; but in Russia they cannot act in this\r\nway, for they know that the judge must condemn the prisoner according\r\nto the Criminal Code. There remains, therefore, but one issue out of the\r\ndifficulty--a verdict of acquittal; and Russian juries--to their honour\r\nbe it said--generally adopt this alternative. Thus the jury, in those\r\ncases in which it is most severely condemned, provides a corrective for\r\nthe injustice of the criminal legislation. Occasionally, it is true,\r\nthey go a little too far in this direction and arrogate to themselves\r\na right of pardon, but cases of that kind are, I believe, very rare.\r\nI know of only one well-authenticated instance. The prisoner had been\r\nproved guilty of a serious crime, but it happened to be the eve of a\r\ngreat religious festival, and the jury thought that in pardoning the\r\nprisoner and giving a verdict of acquittal they would be acting as good\r\nChristians!\r\n\r\nThe legislation regards, of course, this practice as an abuse, and has\r\ntried to prevent it by concealing as far as possible from the jury the\r\npunishment that awaits the accused if he be condemned. For this\r\npurpose it forbids the counsel for the prisoner to inform the jury what\r\npunishment is prescribed by the Code for the crime in question. This\r\ningenious device not only fails in its object, but has sometimes a\r\ndirectly opposite effect. Not knowing what the punishment will be, and\r\nfearing that it may be out of all proportion to the crime, the jury\r\nsometimes acquit a criminal whom they would condemn if they knew\r\nwhat punishment would be inflicted. And when a jury is, as it were,\r\nentrapped, and finds that the punishment is more severe than it\r\nsupposed, it can take its revenge in the succeeding cases. I know at\r\nleast of one instance of this kind. A jury convicted a prisoner of\r\nan offence which it regarded as very trivial, but which in reality\r\nentailed, according to the Code, seven years of penal servitude! So\r\nsurprised and frightened were the jurymen by this unexpected consequence\r\nof their verdict, that they obstinately acquitted, in the face of the\r\nmost convincing evidence, all the other prisoners brought before them.\r\n\r\nThe most famous case of acquital when there was no conceivable doubt as\r\nto the guilt of the accused was that of Vera Zasulitch, who shot\r\nGeneral Trepof, Prefect of St. Petersburg; but the circumstances were\r\nso peculiar that they will hardly support any general conclusion.\r\nI happened to be present, and watched the proceedings closely. Vera\r\nZasulitch, a young woman who had for some time taken part in the\r\nrevolutionary movement, heard that a young revolutionist called\r\nBogoliubof, imprisoned in St. Petersburg, had been flogged by orders of\r\nGeneral Trepof,* and though she did not know the victim personally she\r\ndetermined to avenge the indignity to which he had been subjected.\r\nWith this intention she appeared at the Prefecture, ostensibly for the\r\npurpose of presenting a petition, and when she found herself in the\r\npresence of the Prefect she fired a revolver at him, wounding him\r\nseriously, but not mortally. At the trial the main facts were not\r\ndisputed, and yet the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty. This\r\nunexpected result was due, I believe, partly to a desire to make a\r\nlittle political demonstration, and partly to a strong suspicion that\r\nthe prison authorities, in carrying out the Prefect\u0027s orders, had acted\r\nin summary fashion without observing the tedious formalities prescribed\r\nby the law. Certainly one of the prison officials, when under\r\ncross-examination, made on me, and on the public generally, the\r\nimpression that he was prevaricating in order to shield his superiors.\r\n\r\n     * The reason alleged by General Trepof for giving these\r\n     orders was that, during a visit of inspection, Bogoliubof\r\n     had behaved disrespectfully towards him, and had thereby\r\n     committed an infraction of prison discipline, for which the\r\n     law prescribes the use of corporal punishment.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the proceedings, which were dexterously conducted by\r\nCounsel in such a way that, as the Emperor is reported to have said,\r\nit was not Vera Zasulitch but General Trepof who was being tried,\r\nan eminent Russian journalist rushed up to me in a state of intense\r\nexcitement and said: \"Is not this a great day for the cause of political\r\nfreedom in Russia?\" I could not agree with him and I ventured to predict\r\nthat neither of us would ever again see a political case tried publicly\r\nby jury in an ordinary court. The prediction has proved true. Since that\r\ntime political offenders have been tried by special tribunals without\r\na jury or dealt with \"by administrative procedure,\" that is to say,\r\ninquisitorially, without any regular trial.\r\n\r\nThe defects, real and supposed, of the present system are commonly\r\nattributed to the predominance of the peasant element in the juries; and\r\nthis opinion, founded on a priori reasoning, seems to many too evident\r\nto require verification. The peasantry are in many respects the most\r\nignorant class, and therefore, it is assumed, they are least capable of\r\nweighing conflicting evidence. Plain and conclusive as this reasoning\r\nseems, it is in my opinion erroneous. The peasants have, indeed,\r\nlittle education, but they have a large fund of plain common-sense; and\r\nexperience proves--so at least I have been informed by many judges and\r\nPublic Prosecutors--that, as a general rule, a peasant jury is more to\r\nbe relied on than a jury drawn from the educated classes. It must be\r\nadmitted, however, that a peasant jury has certain peculiarities, and it\r\nis not a little interesting to observe what those peculiarities are.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a jury composed of peasants generally acts in a\r\nsomewhat patriarchal fashion, and does not always confine its attention\r\nto the evidence and the arguments adduced at the trial. The members form\r\ntheir judgment as men do in the affairs of ordinary life, and are sure\r\nto be greatly influenced by any jurors who happen to be personally\r\nacquainted with the prisoner. If several of the jurors know him to be a\r\nbad character, he has little chance of being acquitted, even though\r\nthe chain of evidence against him should not be quite perfect. Peasants\r\ncannot understand why a notorious scoundrel should be allowed to escape\r\nbecause a little link in the evidence is wanting, or because some little\r\njudicial formality has not been duly observed. Indeed, their ideas of\r\ncriminal procedure in general are extremely primitive. The Communal\r\nmethod of dealing with malefactors is best in accordance with their\r\nconceptions of well-regulated society. The Mir may, by a Communal decree\r\nand without a formal trial, have any of its unruly members transported\r\nto Siberia! This summary, informal mode of procedure seems to the\r\npeasants very satisfactory. They are at a loss to understand how a\r\nnotorious culprit is allowed to \"buy\" an advocate to defend him, and are\r\nvery insensible to the bought advocate\u0027s eloquence. To many of them,\r\nif I may trust to conversations which I have casually overheard in and\r\naround the courts, \"buying an advocate\" seems to be very much the same\r\nkind of operation as bribing a judge.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the peasants, when acting as jurors, are very\r\nsevere with regard to crimes against property. In this they are\r\ninstigated by the simple instinct of self-defence. They are, in fact,\r\ncontinually at the mercy of thieves and malefactors. They live in wooden\r\nhouses easily set on fire; their stables might be broken into by a\r\nchild; at night the village is guarded merely by an old man, who cannot\r\nbe in more than one place at a time, and in the one place he is apt to\r\ngo to sleep; a police officer is rarely seen, except when a crime has\r\nactually been committed. A few clever horse-stealers may ruin many\r\nfamilies, and a fire-raiser, in his desire to avenge himself on an\r\nenemy, may reduce a whole village to destitution. These and similar\r\nconsiderations tend to make the peasants very severe against theft,\r\nrobbery, and arson; and a Public Prosecutor who desires to obtain a\r\nconviction against a man charged with one of these crimes endeavours to\r\nhave a jury in which the peasant class is largely represented.\r\n\r\nWith regard to fraud in its various forms, the peasants are much more\r\nlenient, probably because the line of demarcation between honest and\r\ndishonest dealing in commercial affairs is not very clearly drawn in\r\ntheir minds. Many, for instance, are convinced that trade cannot be\r\nsuccessfully carried on without a little clever cheating; and hence\r\ncheating is regarded as a venial offence. If the money fraudulently\r\nacquired be restored to the owner, the crime is supposed to be\r\ncompletely condoned. Thus when a Volost Elder appropriates the public\r\nmoney, and succeeds in repaying it before the case comes on for trial,\r\nhe is invariably acquitted--and sometimes even re-elected!\r\n\r\nAn equal leniency is generally shown by peasants towards crimes against\r\nthe person, such as assaults, cruelty, and the like. This fact is easily\r\nexplained. Refined sensitiveness and a keen sympathy with physical\r\nsuffering are the result of a certain amount of material well-being,\r\ntogether with a certain degree of intellectual and moral culture, and\r\nneither of these is yet possessed by the Russian peasantry. Any one who\r\nhas had opportunities of frequently observing the peasants must have\r\nbeen often astonished by their indifference to suffering, both in their\r\nown persons and in the person of others. In a drunken brawl heads may be\r\nbroken and wounds inflicted without any interference on the part of the\r\nspectators. If no fatal consequences ensue, the peasant does not think\r\nit necessary that official notice should be taken of the incident,\r\nand certainly does not consider that any of the combatants should be\r\ntransported to Siberia. Slight wounds heal of their own accord without\r\nany serious loss to the sufferer, and therefore the man who inflicts\r\nthem is not to be put on the same level as the criminal who reduces\r\na family to beggary. This reasoning may, perhaps, shock people of\r\nsensitive nerves, but it undeniably contains a certain amount of plain,\r\nhomely wisdom.\r\n\r\nOf all kinds of cruelty, that which is perhaps most revolting to\r\ncivilised mankind is the cruelty of the husband towards his wife; but\r\nto this crime the Russian peasant shows especial leniency. He is still\r\ninfluenced by the old conceptions of the husband\u0027s rights, and by that\r\nlow estimate of the weaker sex which finds expression in many popular\r\nproverbs.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar moral conceptions reflected in these facts are\r\nevidently the result of external conditions, and not of any recondite\r\nethnographical peculiarities, for they are not found among the\r\nmerchants, who are nearly all of peasant origin. On the contrary, the\r\nmerchants are more severe with regard to crimes against the person\r\nthan with regard to crimes against property. The explanation of this\r\nis simple. The merchant has means of protecting his property, and if\r\nhe should happen to suffer by theft, his fortune is not likely to\r\nbe seriously affected by it. On the other hand, he has a certain\r\nsensitiveness with regard to such crimes as assault; for though he has\r\ncommonly not much more intellectual and moral culture than the peasant,\r\nhe is accustomed to comfort and material well-being, which naturally\r\ndevelop sensitiveness regarding physical pain.\r\n\r\nTowards fraud the merchants are quite as lenient as the peasantry. This\r\nmay, perhaps, seem strange, for fraudulent practices are sure in the\r\nlong run to undermine trade. The Russian merchants, however, have not\r\nyet arrived at this conception, and can point to many of the richest\r\nmembers of their class as a proof that fraudulent practices often create\r\nenormous fortunes. Long ago Samuel Butler justly remarked that we damn\r\nthe sins we have no mind to.\r\n\r\nAs the external conditions have little or no influence on the religious\r\nconceptions of the merchants and the peasantry, the two classes are\r\nequally severe with regard to those acts which are regarded as crimes\r\nagainst the Deity. Hence acquittals in cases of sacrilege, blasphemy,\r\nand the like never occur unless the jury is in part composed of educated\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nIn their decisions, as in their ordinary modes of thought, the jurors\r\ndrawn from the educated classes are little, if at all, affected by\r\ntheological conceptions, but they are sometimes influenced in a not less\r\nunfortunate way by conceptions of a different order. It may happen,\r\nfor instance, that a juror who had passed through one of the higher\r\neducational establishments has his own peculiar theory about the value\r\nof evidence, or he is profoundly impressed with the idea that it is\r\nbetter that a thousand guilty men should escape than that one\r\ninnocent man should be punished, or he is imbued with sentimental\r\npseudo-philanthropy, or he is convinced that punishments are useless\r\nbecause they neither cure the delinquent nor deter others from crime; in\r\na word, he may have in some way or other lost his mental balance in\r\nthat moral chaos through which Russia is at present passing. In England,\r\nFrance, or Germany such an individual would have little influence on\r\nhis fellow-jurymen, for in these countries there are very few people who\r\nallow new paradoxical ideas to overturn their traditional notions and\r\nobscure their common-sense; but in Russia, where even the elementary\r\nmoral conceptions are singularly unstable and pliable, a man of this\r\ntype may succeed in leading a jury. More than once I have heard men\r\nboast of having induced their fellow-jurymen to acquit every prisoner\r\nbrought before them, not because they believed the prisoners to be\r\ninnocent or the evidence to be insufficient, but because all punishments\r\nare useless and barbarous.\r\n\r\nOne word in conclusion regarding the independence and political\r\nsignificance of the new courts. When the question of judicial reform\r\nwas first publicly raised many people hoped that the new courts would\r\nreceive complete autonomy and real independence, and would thus form a\r\nfoundation for political liberty. These hopes, like so many illusions of\r\nthat strange time, have not been realised. A large measure of autonomy\r\nand independence was indeed granted in theory. The law laid down the\r\nprinciple that no judge could be removed unless convicted of a definite\r\ncrime, and that the courts should present candidates for all the vacant\r\nplaces on the Bench; but these and similar rights have little practical\r\nsignificance. If the Minister cannot depose a judge, he can deprive him\r\nof all possibility of receiving promotion, and he can easily force him\r\nin an indirect way to send in his resignation; and if the courts have\r\nstill the right to present candidates for vacant places, the Minister\r\nhas also this right, and can, of course, always secure the nomination\r\nof his own candidate. By the influence of that centripetal force which\r\nexists in all centralised bureaucracies, the Procureurs have become more\r\nimportant personages than the Presidents of the courts.\r\n\r\nFrom the political point of view the question of the independence of\r\nthe Courts has not yet acquired much practical importance, because\r\nthe Government can always have political offenders tried by a special\r\ntribunal or can send them to Siberia for an indefinite term of years\r\nwithout regular trial by the \"administrative procedure\" to which I have\r\nabove referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nREVOLUTIONARY NIHILISM AND THE REACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reform-enthusiasm Becomes Unpractical and Culminates in\r\nNihilism--Nihilism, the Distorted Reflection of Academic Western\r\nSocialism--Russia Well Prepared for Reception of Ultra-Socialist\r\nVirus--Social Reorganisation According to Latest Results of\r\nScience--Positivist Theory--Leniency of Press-censure--Chief\r\nRepresentatives of New Movement--Government Becomes Alarmed--Repressive\r\nMeasures--Reaction in the Public--The Term Nihilist Invented--The\r\nNihilist and His Theory--Further Repressive Measures--Attitude of Landed\r\nProprietors--Foundation of a Liberal Party--Liberalism Checked by Polish\r\nInsurrection--Practical Reform Continued--An Attempt at Regicide Forms\r\na Turning-point of Government\u0027s Policy--Change in Educational\r\nSystem--Decline of Nihilism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapidly increasing enthusiasm for reform did not confine itself to\r\npractical measures such as the emancipation of the serfs, the creation\r\nof local self-government, and the thorough reorganisation of the\r\nlaw-courts and legal procedure. In the younger section of the educated\r\nclasses, and especially among the students of the universities and\r\ntechnical colleges, it produced a feverish intellectual excitement and\r\nwild aspirations which culminated in what is commonly known as Nihilism.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding chapter I pointed out that during the last two centuries\r\nall the important intellectual movements in Western Europe have been\r\nreflected in Russia, and that these reflections have generally been\r\nwhat may fairly be termed exaggerated and distorted reproductions of\r\nthe originals.* Roughly speaking, the Nihilist movement in Russia may\r\nbe described as the exaggerated, distorted reflection of the earlier\r\nSocialist movements of the West; but it has local peculiarities and\r\nlocal colouring which deserve attention.\r\n\r\n     * See Chapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nThe Russian educated classes had been well prepared by their past\r\nhistory for the reception and rapid development of the Socialist virus.\r\nFor a century and a half the country had been subjected to a series of\r\ndrastic changes, administrative and social, by the energetic action of\r\nthe Autocratic Power, with little spontaneous co-operation on the\r\npart of the people. In a nation with such a history, Socialistic ideas\r\nnaturally found favour, because all Socialist systems until quite recent\r\ntimes were founded on the assumption that political and social progress\r\nmust be the result not of slow natural development, but rather of\r\nphilosophic speculation, legislative wisdom, and administrative energy.\r\n\r\nThis assumption lay at the bottom of the reform enthusiasm in St.\r\nPetersburg at the commencement of Alexander II.\u0027s reign. Russia might\r\nbe radically transformed, it was thought, politically and socially,\r\naccording to abstract scientific principles, in the space of a few\r\nyears, and be thereby raised to the level of West-European civilisation,\r\nor even higher. The older nations had for centuries groped in darkness,\r\nor stumbled along in the faint light of practical experience, and\r\nconsequently their progress had been slow and uncertain. For Russia\r\nthere was no necessity to follow such devious, unexplored paths. She\r\nought to profit by the experience of her elder sisters, and avoid the\r\nerrors into which they had fallen. Nor was it difficult to ascertain\r\nwhat these errors were, because they had been discovered, examined\r\nand explained by the most eminent thinkers of France and England, and\r\nefficient remedies had been prescribed. Russian reformers had merely to\r\nstudy and apply the conclusions at which these eminent authorities had\r\narrived, and their task would be greatly facilitated by the fact\r\nthat they could operate on virgin soil, untrammelled by the feudal\r\ntraditions, religious superstitions, metaphysical conceptions, romantic\r\nillusions, aristocratic prejudices, and similar obstacles to social and\r\npolitical progress which existed in Western Europe.\r\n\r\nSuch was the extraordinary intellectual atmosphere in which the Russian\r\neducated classes lived during the early years of the sixties. On the\r\n\"men with aspirations,\" who had longed in vain for more light and\r\nmore public activity under the obscurantist, repressive regime of the\r\npreceding reign, it had an intoxicating effect. The more excitable and\r\nsanguine amongst them now believed seriously that they had discovered\r\na convenient short-cut to national prosperity, and that for Russia a\r\ngrandiose social and political millennium was at hand.*\r\n\r\n     * I was not myself in St. Petersburg at that period, but on\r\n     arriving a few years afterwards I became intimately\r\n     acquainted with men and women who had lived through it, and\r\n     who still retained much of their early enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it is not surprising that one of the most\r\nprominent characteristics of the time was a boundless, child-like faith\r\nin the so-called \"latest results of science.\" Infallible science\r\nwas supposed to have found the solution of all political and social\r\nproblems. What a reformer had to do--and who was not a would-be reformer\r\nin those days?--was merely to study the best authorities. Their works\r\nhad been long rigidly excluded by the Press censure, but now that it was\r\npossible to obtain them, they were read with avidity. Chief among the\r\nnew, infallible prophets whose works were profoundly venerated was\r\nAuguste Comte, the inventor of Positivism. In his classification of the\r\nsciences the crowning of the edifice was sociology, which taught how to\r\norganise human society on scientific principles. Russia had merely to\r\nadopt the principles laid down and expounded at great length in the\r\nCours de Philosophie Positive. There Comte explained that humanity had\r\nto pass through three stages of intellectual development--the religious,\r\nthe metaphysical, and the positive--and that the most advanced nations,\r\nafter spending centuries in the two first, were entering on the third.\r\nRussia must endeavour, therefore, to get into the positive stage\r\nas quickly as possible, and there was reason to believe that, in\r\nconsequence of certain ethnographical and historical peculiarities, she\r\ncould make the transition more quickly than other nations. After Comte\u0027s\r\nworks, the book which found, for a time, most favour was Buckle\u0027s\r\n\"History of Civilisation,\" which seemed to reduce history and progress\r\nto a matter of statistics, and which laid down the principle that\r\nprogress is always in the inverse ratio of the influence of theological\r\nconceptions. This principle was regarded as of great practical\r\nimportance, and the conclusion drawn from it was that rapid national\r\nprogress was certain if only the influence of religion and theology\r\ncould be destroyed. Very popular, too, was John Stuart Mill, because he\r\nwas \"imbued with enthusiasm for humanity and female emancipation\"; and\r\nin his tract on Utilitarianism he showed that morality was simply\r\nthe crystallised experience of many generations as to what was most\r\nconducive to the greatest good of the greatest number. The minor\r\nprophets of the time, among whom Buchner occupied a prominent place, are\r\ntoo numerous to mention.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the newest and most advanced doctrines appeared\r\nregularly, under a very thin and transparent veil, in the St. Petersburg\r\ndaily Press, and especially in the thick monthly magazines, which were\r\nas big as, or bigger than, our venerable quarterlies. The art of writing\r\nand reading \"between the lines,\" not altogether unknown under the\r\nDraconian regime of Nicholas I., was now developed to such a marvellous\r\nextent that almost any thing could be written clearly enough to be\r\nunderstood by the initiated without calling for the thunderbolts of the\r\nPress censors, which was now only intermittently severe. Indeed, the\r\nPress censors themselves were sometimes carried away by the reform\r\nenthusiasm. One of them long afterwards related to me that during\r\n\"the mad time,\" as he called it, in the course of a single year he\r\nhad received from his superiors no less than seventeen reprimands for\r\npassing objectionable articles without remark.\r\n\r\nThe movement found its warmest partisans among the students and young\r\nliterary men, but not a few grey-beards were to be found among the\r\nyouthful apostles. All who read the periodical literature became more\r\nor less imbued with the new spirit; but it must be presumed that many of\r\nthose who discoursed most eloquently had no clear idea of what they were\r\ntalking about; for even at a later date, when the novices had had\r\ntime to acquaint themselves with the doctrines they professed, I often\r\nencountered the most astounding ignorance. Let me give one instance by\r\nway of illustration:\r\n\r\nA young gentleman who was in the habit of talking glibly about the\r\nnecessity of scientifically reorganising human society, declared to me\r\none day that not only sociology, but also biology should be taken into\r\nconsideration. Confessing my complete ignorance of the latter science,\r\nI requested him to enlighten me by giving me an instance of a biological\r\nprinciple which could be applied to social regeneration. He looked\r\nconfused, and tried to ride out of the difficulty on vague general\r\nphrases; but I persistently kept him to the point, and maliciously\r\nsuggested that as an alternative he might cite to me a biological\r\nprinciple which could NOT be used for such a purpose. Again he failed,\r\nand it became evident to all present that of biology, about which he\r\ntalked so often, he knew absolutely nothing but the name! After this I\r\nfrequently employed the same pseudo-Socratic method of discussion,\r\nand very often with a similar result. Not one in fifty, perhaps, ever\r\nattempted to reduce the current hazy conceptions to a concrete form. The\r\nenthusiasm was not the less intense, however, on that account.\r\n\r\nAt first the partisans of the movement seemed desirous of assisting,\r\nrather than of opposing or undermining the Government, and so long as\r\nthey merely talked academically about scientific principles and\r\nsimilar vague entities, the Government felt no necessity for energetic\r\ninterference; but as early as 1861 symptoms of a change in the character\r\nof the movement became apparent. A secret society of officers organised\r\na small printing-press in the building of the Headquarters Staff and\r\nissued clandestinely three numbers of a periodical called the Velikoruss\r\n(Great Russian), which advocated administrative reform, the convocation\r\nof a constituent assembly, and the emancipation of Poland from Russian\r\nrule. A few months later (April, 1862) a seditious proclamation\r\nappeared, professing to emanate from a central revolutionary committee,\r\nand declaring that the Romanoffs must expiate with their blood the\r\nmisery of the people.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms of an underground revolutionary agitation caused alarm in\r\nthe official world, and repressive measures were at once adopted. Sunday\r\nschools for the working classes, reading-rooms, students\u0027 clubs, and\r\nsimilar institutions which might be used for purposes of revolutionary\r\npropaganda were closed; several trials for political offences took\r\nplace; the most popular of the monthly periodicals (Sovremennik) was\r\nsuspended, and its editor, Tchernishevski, arrested. There was nothing\r\nto show that Tchernishevski was implicated in any treasonable designs,\r\nbut he was undoubtedly the leader of a group of youthful writers whose\r\naspirations went far beyond the intentions of the Government, and it\r\nwas thought desirable to counteract his influence by shutting him up\r\nin prison. Here he wrote and published, with the permission of the\r\nauthorities and the imprimatur of the Press censure, a novel called\r\n\"Shto delat\u0027?\" (\"What is to be Done?\"), which was regarded at first as\r\na most harmless production, but which is now considered one of the most\r\ninfluential and baneful works in the whole range of Nihilist literature.\r\nAs a novel it had no pretensions to artistic merit, and in ordinary\r\ntimes it would have attracted little or no attention, but it put into\r\nconcrete shape many of the vague Socialist and Communist notions that\r\nwere at the moment floating about in the intellectual atmosphere, and\r\nit came to be looked upon by the young enthusiasts as a sort of informal\r\nmanifesto of their new-born faith. It was divided into two parts; in\r\nthe first was described a group of students living according to the\r\nnew ideas in open defiance of traditional conventionalities, and in the\r\nsecond was depicted a village organised on the communistic principles\r\nrecommended by Fourier. The first was supposed to represent the dawn of\r\nthe new era; the second, the goal to be ultimately attained. When the\r\nauthorities discovered the mistake they had committed in allowing the\r\nbook to be published, it was at once confiscated and withdrawn from\r\ncirculation, whilst the author, after being tried by the Senate, was\r\nexiled to Northeastern Siberia and kept there for nearly twenty years.*\r\n\r\n     * Tchernishevski was a man of encyclopaedic knowledge and\r\n     specially conversant with political economy.  According to\r\n     the testimony of those who knew him intimately, he was one\r\n     of the ablest and most sympathetic men of his generation.\r\n     During his exile a bold attempt was made to rescue him, and\r\n     very nearly succeeded.  A daring youth, disguised as an\r\n     officer of gendarmes and provided with forged official\r\n     papers, reached the place where he was confined and procured\r\n     his release, but the officer in charge had vague suspicions,\r\n     and insisted on the two travellers being escorted to the\r\n     next post-station by a couple of Cossacks.  The rescuer\r\n     tried to get rid of the escort by means of his revolver, but\r\n     he failed in the attempt, and the fugitives were arrested.\r\n     In 1883 Tchernishevski was transferred to the milder climate\r\n     of Astrakhan, and in 1889 he was allowed to return to his\r\n     native town, Saratof, where he died a few months afterwards.\r\n\r\nWith the arrest and exile of Tchernishevski the young would-be reformers\r\nwere constrained to recognise that they had no chance of carrying the\r\nGovernment with them in their endeavours to realise their patriotic\r\naspirations. Police supervision over the young generation was increased,\r\nand all kinds of association, whether for mutual instruction, mutual\r\naid, or any other purpose, were discouraged or positively forbidden. And\r\nit was not merely in the mind of the police that suspicion was aroused.\r\nIn the opinion of the great majority of moderate, respectable people\r\nthe young enthusiasts were becoming discredited. The violently seditious\r\nproclamations with which they were supposed to sympathise, and a series\r\nof destructive fires in St. Petersburg, erroneously attributed to them,\r\nfrightened timid Liberals and gave the Reactionaries, who had hitherto\r\nremained silent, an opportunity of preaching their doctrines with\r\ntelling effect. The celebrated novelist, Turgeneif, long the idol of the\r\nyoung generation, had inadvertently in \"Fathers and Children\" invented\r\nthe term Nihilist, and it at once came to be applied as an opprobrious\r\nepithet, notwithstanding the efforts of Pissaref, a popular writer of\r\nremarkable talent, to prove to the public that it ought to be regarded\r\nas a term of honour.\r\n\r\nPissaref\u0027s attempt at rehabilitation made no impression outside of his\r\nown small circle. According to popular opinion the Nihilists were a\r\nband of fanatical young men and women, mostly medical students, who had\r\ndetermined to turn the world upside down and to introduce a new kind of\r\nsocial order, founded on the most advanced principles of social equality\r\nand Communism. As a first step towards the great transformation they had\r\nreversed the traditional order of things in the matter of coiffure: the\r\nmales allowed their hair to grow long, and the female adepts cut their\r\nhair short, adding occasionally the additional badge of blue spectacles.\r\nTheir unkempt appearance naturally shocked the aesthetic feelings of\r\nordinary people, but to this they were indifferent. They had raised\r\nthemselves above the level of popular notions, took no account of\r\nso-called public opinion, gloried in Bohemianism, despised Philistine\r\nrespectability, and rather liked to scandalise old-fashioned people\r\nimbued with antiquated prejudices.\r\n\r\nThis was the ridiculous side of the movement, but underneath the\r\nabsurdities there was something serious. These young men and women, who\r\nwere themselves terribly in earnest, were systematically hostile not\r\nonly to accepted conventionalities in the matter of dress, but to all\r\nmanner of shams, hypocrisy, and cant in the broad Carlylean sense of\r\nthose terms. To the \"beautiful souls\" of the older generation, who had\r\nhabitually, in conversation and literature, shed pathetic tears over the\r\ndefects of Russian social and political organisation without ever moving\r\na finger to correct them--especially the landed proprietors who\r\ntalked and wrote about civilisation, culture, and justice while living\r\ncomfortably on the revenues provided for them by their unfortunate\r\nserfs--these had the strongest aversion; and this naturally led them to\r\ncondemn in strong language the worship of aesthetic culture. But here\r\nagain they fell into exaggeration. Professing extreme utilitarianism,\r\nthey explained that the humble shoemaker who practises his craft\r\ndiligently is, in the true sense, a greater man than a Shakespeare, or\r\na Goethe, because humanity has more need of shoes than of dramas and\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\nSuch silly paradoxes provoked, of course, merely a smile of compassion;\r\nwhat alarmed the sensible, respectable \"Philistine\" was the method of\r\ncleansing the Augean stable recommended by these enthusiasts. Having\r\ndiscovered in the course of their desultory reading that most of\r\nthe ills that flesh is heir to proceed directly or indirectly from\r\nuncontrolled sexual passion and the lust of gain, they proposed to seal\r\nhermetically these two great sources of crime and misery by abolishing\r\nthe old-fashioned institutions of marriage and private property. When\r\nsociety, they argued, should be so organised that all the healthy\r\ninstincts of human nature could find complete and untrammelled\r\nsatisfaction, there would be no motive or inducement for committing\r\ncrimes or misdemeanours. For thousands of years humanity had been\r\nsailing on a wrong tack. The great law-givers of the world, religious\r\nand civil, in their ignorance of physical science and positivist\r\nmethods, had created institutions, commonly known as law and morality,\r\nwhich were utterly unfitted to human nature, and then the magistrate\r\nand the moralist had endeavoured to compel or persuade men and women to\r\nconform to them, but their efforts had failed most signally. In vain\r\nthe police had threatened and punished and the priests had preached and\r\nadmonished. Human nature had systematically and obstinately rebelled,\r\nand still rebels, against the unnatural constraint. It is time,\r\ntherefore, to try a new system. Instead of continuing, as has been done\r\nfor thousands of years, to force men and women, as it were, into badly\r\nfitting, unelastic clothes which cause intense discomfort and prevent\r\nall healthy muscular action, why not adapt the costume to the anatomy\r\nand physiology of the human frame? Then the clothes will no longer be\r\nrent, and those who wear them will be contented and happy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the progress of humanity there are serious obstacles\r\nin the way of this radical change of system. The absurd, antiquated\r\nand pernicious institutions and customs are supported by abstruse\r\nmetaphysical reasons and enshrined in mystical romantic sentiment, and\r\nin this way they may still be preserved for generations unless the axe\r\nbe laid to the root of the tree. Now is the critical moment. Russia must\r\nbe made to rise at once from the metaphysical to the positivist stage of\r\nintellectual development; metaphysical reasoning and romantic sentiment\r\nmust be rigorously discarded; and everything must be brought to the\r\ntouchstone of naked practical utility.\r\n\r\nOne might naturally suppose that men holding such opinions must be\r\nmaterialists of the grossest type--and, indeed, many of them gloried\r\nin the name of materialist and atheist--but such an inference would\r\nbe erroneous. While denouncing metaphysics, they were themselves\r\nmetaphysicians in so far as they were constantly juggling with abstract\r\nconceptions, and letting themselves be guided in their walk and\r\nconversation by a priori deductions; while ridiculing romanticism, they\r\nhad romantic sentiment enough to make them sacrifice their time,\r\ntheir property, and sometimes even their life, to the attainment of an\r\nunrealisable ideal; and while congratulating themselves on having passed\r\nfrom the religious to the positivist stage of intellectual development,\r\nthey frequently showed themselves animated with the spirit of the early\r\nmartyrs! Rarely have the strange inconsistencies of human nature been so\r\nstrikingly exemplified as in these unpractical, anti-religious fanatics.\r\nIn dealing with them I might easily, without very great exaggeration,\r\nproduce a most amusing caricature, but I prefer describing them as they\r\nreally were. A few years after the period here referred to I knew some\r\nof them intimately, and I must say that, without at all sharing or\r\nsympathising with their opinions, I could not help respecting them\r\nas honourable, upright, quixotic men and women who had made great\r\nsacrifices for their convictions. One of them whom I have specially\r\nin view at this moment suffered patiently for years from the utter\r\nshipwreck of his generous illusions, and when he could no longer hope to\r\nsee the dawn of a brighter day, he ended by committing suicide. Yet that\r\nman believed himself to be a Realist, a Materialist, and a Utilitarian\r\nof the purest water, and habitually professed a scathing contempt for\r\nevery form of romantic sentiment! In reality he was one of the best and\r\nmost sympathetic men I have ever known.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression. So long as the subversive opinions were\r\nveiled in abstract language they raised misgivings in only a comparative\r\nsmall circle; but when school-teachers put them into a form suited to\r\nthe juvenile mind, they were apt to produce startling effects. In a\r\nsatirical novel of the time a little girl is represented as coming\r\nto her mother and saying, \"Little mamma! Maria Ivan\u0027na (our new\r\nschool-mistress) says there is no God and no Tsar, and that it is wrong\r\nto marry!\" Whether such incidents actually occurred in real life, as\r\nseveral friends assured me, I am not prepared to say, but certainly\r\npeople believed that they might occur in their own families, and that\r\nwas quite sufficient to produce alarm even in the ranks of the Liberals,\r\nto say nothing of the rapidly increasing army of the Reactionaries.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the general uneasiness produced in St. Petersburg, I may\r\nquote here a letter written in October, 1861, by a man who occupied one\r\nof the highest positions in the Administration. As he had the reputation\r\nof being an ultra-Liberal who sympathised overmuch with Young Russia,\r\nwe may assume that he did not take an exceptionally alarmist view of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have not been long absent--merely a few months; but if you returned\r\nnow, you would be astonished by the progress which the Opposition, one\r\nmight say the Revolutionary Party, has already made. The disorders in\r\nthe university do not concern merely the students. I see in the affair\r\nthe beginning of serious dangers for public tranquillity and the\r\nexisting order of things. Young people, without distinction of costume,\r\nuniform and origin, take part in the street demonstrations. Besides\r\nthe students of the university, there are the students of other\r\ninstitutions, and a mass of people who are students only in name.\r\nAmong these last are certain gentlemen in long beards and a number of\r\nrevolutionnaires in crinoline, who are of all the most fanatical. Blue\r\ncollars--the distinguishing mark of the students\u0027 uniform--have become\r\nthe signe de ralliement. Almost all the professors and many officers\r\ntake the part of the students. The newspaper critics openly defend\r\ntheir colleagues. Mikhailof has been convicted of writing, printing and\r\ncirculating one of the most violent proclamations that ever existed,\r\nunder the heading, \u0027To the young generation!\u0027 Among the students and the\r\nmen of letters there is unquestionably an organised conspiracy, which\r\nhas perhaps leaders outside the literary circle. . . . The police are\r\npowerless. They arrest any one they can lay hands on. About eighty\r\npeople have already been sent to the fortress and examined, but all this\r\nleads to no practical result, because the revolutionary ideas have taken\r\npossession of all classes, all ages, all professions, and are publicly\r\nexpressed in the streets, in the barracks, and in the Ministries. I\r\nbelieve the police itself is carried away by them! What this will lead\r\nto, it is difficult to predict. I am very much afraid of some bloody\r\ncatastrophe. Even if it should not go to such a length immediately, the\r\nposition of the Government will be extremely difficult. Its authority\r\nis shaken, and all are convinced that it is powerless, stupid and\r\nincapable. On that point there is the most perfect unanimity among\r\nall parties of all colours, even the most opposite. The most desperate\r\n\u0027planter\u0027* agrees in that respect with the most desperate socialist.\r\nMeanwhile those who have the direction of affairs do almost nothing and\r\nhave no plan or definite aim in view. At present the Emperor is not in\r\nthe Capital, and now, more than at any other time, there is complete\r\nanarchy in the absence of the master of the house. There is a great deal\r\nof bustle and talk, and all blame they know not whom.\"**\r\n\r\n     * An epithet commonly applied, at the time of the\r\n     Emancipation, to the partisans of serfage and the defenders\r\n     of the proprietors\u0027 rights.\r\n\r\n     ** I found this interesting letter (which might have been\r\n     written today) thirty years ago among the private papers of\r\n     Nicholas Milutin, who played a leading part as an official\r\n     in the reforms of the time.  It was first published in an\r\n     article on \"Secret Societies in Russia,\" which I contributed\r\n     to the Fortnightly Review of 1st August, 1877.\r\n\r\nThe expected revolution did not take place, but timid people had no\r\ndifficulty in perceiving signs of its approach. The Press continued\r\nto disseminate, under a more or less disguised form, ideas which\r\nwere considered dangerous. The Kolokol, a Russian revolutionary\r\npaper published in London by Herzen and strictly prohibited by the\r\nPress-censure, found its way in large quantities into the country, and,\r\nas is recorded in an earlier chapter, was read by thousands, including\r\nthe higher officials and the Emperor himself, who found it regularly on\r\nhis writing-table, laid there by some unknown hand. In St. Petersburg\r\nthe arrest of Tchernishevski and the suspension of his magazine, The\r\nContemporary, made the writers a little more cautious in their mode of\r\nexpression, but the spirit of the articles remained unchanged. These\r\nenergetic intolerant leaders of public opinion were novi homines not\r\npersonally connected with the social strata in which moderate views and\r\nretrograde tenderness had begun to prevail. Mostly sons of priests or\r\nof petty officials, they belonged to a recently created literary\r\nproletariat composed of young men with boundless aspirations and meagre\r\nnational resources, who earned a precarious subsistence by journalism or\r\nby giving lessons in private families. Living habitually in a world of\r\ntheories and unrestrained by practical acquaintance with public life,\r\nthey were ready, from the purest and most disinterested motives to\r\ndestroy ruthlessly the existing order of things in order to realise\r\ntheir crude notions of social regeneration. Their heated imagination\r\nshowed them in the near future a New Russia, composed of independent\r\nfederated Communes, without any bureaucracy or any central power--a\r\nhappy land in which everybody virtuously and automatically fulfilled\r\nhis public and private duties, and in which the policeman and all other\r\nembodiments of material constraint were wholly superfluous.\r\n\r\nGovernments are not easily converted to Utopian schemes of that idyllic\r\ntype, and it is not surprising that even a Government with liberal\r\nhumanitarian aspirations like that of Alexander II. should have become\r\nalarmed and should have attempted to stem the current. What is to be\r\nregretted is that the repressive measures adopted were a little too\r\nOriental in their character. Scores of young students of both sexes--for\r\nthe Nihilist army included a strong female contingent--were secretly\r\narrested and confined for months in unwholesome prisons, and many\r\nof them were finally exiled, without any regular trial, to distant\r\nprovinces in European Russia or to Siberia. Their exile, it is true, was\r\nnot at all so terrible as is commonly supposed, because political exiles\r\nare not usually confined in prisons or compelled to labour in the\r\nmines, but are obliged merely to reside at a given place under police\r\nsupervision. Still, such punishment was severe enough for educated young\r\nmen and women, especially when their lot was cast among a population\r\ncomposed exclusively of peasants and small shop-keepers or of Siberian\r\naborigines, and when there were no means of satisfying the most\r\nelementary intellectual wants. For those who had no private resources\r\nthe punishment was particularly severe, because the Government granted\r\nmerely a miserable monthly pittance, hardly sufficient to purchase food\r\nof the coarsest kind, and there was rarely an opportunity of adding to\r\nthe meagre official allowance by intellectual or manual labour. In\r\nall cases the treatment accorded to the exiles wounded their sense of\r\njustice and increased the existing discontent among their friends and\r\nacquaintances. Instead of acting as a deterrent, the system produced a\r\nfeeling of profound indignation, and ultimately transformed not a few\r\nsentimental dreamers into active conspirators.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no conspiracy or regularly organised secret society\r\nand nothing of which the criminal law in Western Europe could have taken\r\ncognisance. Students met in each other\u0027s rooms to discuss prohibited\r\nbooks on political and social science, and occasionally short essays on\r\nthe subjects discussed were written in a revolutionary spirit by members\r\nof the coterie. This was called mutual instruction. Between the various\r\ncoteries or groups there were private personal relations, not only in\r\nthe capital, but also in the provinces, so that manuscripts and printed\r\npapers could be transmitted from one group to another. From time to time\r\nthe police captured these academic disquisitions, and made raids on the\r\nmeetings of students who had come together merely for conversation and\r\ndiscussion; and the fresh arrests caused by these incidents increased\r\nthe hostility to the Government.\r\n\r\nIn the letter above quoted it is said that the revolutionary ideas had\r\ntaken possession of all classes, all ages, and all professions. This may\r\nhave been true with regard to St. Petersburg, but it could not have\r\nbeen said of the provinces. There the landed proprietors were in a very\r\ndifferent frame of mind. They had to struggle with a multitude of urgent\r\npractical affairs which left them little time for idyllic dreaming about\r\nan imaginary millennium. Their serfs had been emancipated, and what\r\nremained to them of their estates had to be reorganised on the basis\r\nof free labour. Into the semi-chaotic state of things created by such\r\nfar-reaching changes, legal and economic, they did not wish to see any\r\nmore confusion introduced, and they did not at all feel that they could\r\ndispense with the Central Government and the policeman. On the contrary,\r\nthe Central Government was urgently needed in order to obtain a little\r\nready money wherewith to reorganise the estates in the new conditions,\r\nand the police organisation required to be strengthened in order to\r\ncompel the emancipated serfs to fulfil their legal obligations. These\r\nmen and their families were, therefore, much more conservative than the\r\nclass commonly designated \"the young generation,\" and they naturally\r\nsympathised with the \"Philistines\" in St. Petersburg, who had been\r\nalarmed by the exaggerations of the Nihilists.\r\n\r\nEven the landed proprietors, however, were not so entirely free from\r\ndiscontent and troublesome political aspirations as the Government would\r\nhave desired. They had not forgotten the autocratic and bureaucratic way\r\nin which the Emancipation had been prepared, and their indignation had\r\nbeen only partially appeased by their being allowed to carry out the\r\nprovisions of the law without much bureaucratic interference. So much\r\nfor the discontent. As for the reform aspirations, they thought that, as\r\na compensation for having consented to the liberation of their serfs and\r\nfor having been expropriated from about a half of their land, they ought\r\nto receive extensive political rights, and be admitted, like the upper\r\nclasses in Western Europe, to a fair share in the government of the\r\ncountry. Unlike the fiery young Nihilists of St. Petersburg, they did\r\nnot want to abolish or paralyse the central power; what they wanted\r\nwas to co-operate with it loyally and to give their advice on important\r\nquestions by means of representative institutions. They formed a\r\nconstitutional group which exists still at the present day, as we shall\r\nsee in the sequel, but which has never been allowed to develop into an\r\norganised political party. Its aims were so moderate that its programme\r\nmight have been used as a convenient safety-valve for the explosive\r\nforces which were steadily accumulating under the surface of Society,\r\nbut it never found favour in the official world. When some of its\r\nleading members ventured to hint in the Press and in loyal addresses to\r\nthe Emperor that the Government would do well to consult the country on\r\nimportant questions, their respectful suggestions were coldly received\r\nor bluntly rejected by the bureaucracy and the Autocratic Power.\r\n\r\nThe more the revolutionary and constitutional groups sought to\r\nstrengthen their position, the more pronounced became the reactionary\r\ntendencies in the official world, and these received in 1863 an immense\r\nimpetus from the Polish insurrection, with which the Nihilists and even\r\nsome of the Liberals sympathised.* That ill-advised attempt on the\r\npart of the Poles to recover their independence had a curious effect\r\non Russian public opinion. Alexander II., with the warm approval of\r\nthe more Liberal section of the educated classes, was in the course of\r\ncreating for Poland almost complete administrative autonomy under\r\nthe viceroyalty of a Russian Grand Duke; and the Emperor\u0027s brother\r\nConstantine was preparing to carry out the scheme in a generous spirit.\r\nSoon it became evident that what the Poles wanted was not administrative\r\nautonomy, but political independence, with the frontiers which existed\r\nbefore the first partition! Trusting to the expected assistance of the\r\nWestern Powers and the secret connivance of Austria, they raised the\r\nstandard of insurrection, and some trifling successes were magnified by\r\nthe pro-Polish Press into important victories. As the news of the rising\r\nspread over Russia, there was a moment of hesitation. Those who had been\r\nfor some years habitually extolling liberty and self-government as the\r\nnormal conditions of progress, who had been sympathising warmly with\r\nevery Liberal movement, whether at home or abroad, and who had put\r\nforward a voluntary federation of independent Communes as the ideal\r\nState organism, could not well frown on the political aspirations of\r\nthe Polish patriots. The Liberal sentiment of that time was so extremely\r\nphilosophical and cosmopolitan that it hardly distinguished between\r\nPoles and Russians, and liberty was supposed to be the birthright of\r\nevery man and woman to whatever nationality they might happen to belong.\r\nBut underneath these beautiful artificial clouds of cosmopolitan Liberal\r\nsentiment lay the volcano of national patriotism, dormant for the\r\nmoment, but by no means extinct. Though the Russians are in some\r\nrespects the most cosmopolitan of European nations, they are at the same\r\ntime capable of indulging in violent outbursts of patriotic\r\nfanaticism; and events in Warsaw brought into hostile contact these two\r\ncontradictory elements in the national character. The struggle was only\r\nmomentary. Ere long the patriotic feelings gained the upper hand and\r\ncrushed all cosmopolitan sympathy with political freedom. The Moscow\r\nGazette, the first of the papers to recover its mental equilibrium,\r\nthundered against the pseudo-Liberal sentimentalism, which would, if\r\nunchecked, necessarily lead to the dismemberment of the Empire, and\r\nits editor, Katkoff, became for a time the most influential private\r\nindividual in the country. A few, indeed, remained true to their\r\nconvictions. Herzen, for instance, wrote in the Kolokol a glowing\r\npanegyric on two Russian officers who had refused to fire on the\r\ninsurgents; and here and there a good Orthodox Russian might be found\r\nwho confessed that he was ashamed of Muravieff\u0027s extreme severity\r\nin Lithuania. But such men were few, and were commonly regarded as\r\ntraitors, especially after the ill-advised diplomatic intervention of\r\nthe Western Powers. Even Herzen, by his publicly expressed sympathy with\r\nthe insurgents, lost entirely his popularity and influence among his\r\nfellow-countrymen. The great majority of the public thoroughly approved\r\nof the severe energetic measures adopted by the Government, and when the\r\ninsurrection was suppressed, men who had a few months previously spoken\r\nand written in magniloquent terms about humanitarian Liberalism joined\r\nin the ovations offered to Muravieff! At a great dinner given in his\r\nhonour, that ruthless administrator of the old Muscovite type, who\r\nhad systematically opposed the emancipation of the serfs and had\r\nnever concealed his contempt for the Liberal ideas in fashion, could\r\nironically express his satisfaction at seeing around him so many \"new\r\nfriends\"!** This revulsion of public feeling gave the Moscow Slavophils\r\nan opportunity of again preaching their doctrine that the safety\r\nand prosperity of Russia were to be found, not in the Liberalism and\r\nConstitutionalism of Western Europe, but in patriarchal autocracy,\r\nEastern Orthodoxy, and other peculiarities of Russian nationality.\r\nThus the reactionary tendencies gained ground; but Alexander II., while\r\ncausing all political agitation to be repressed, did not at once abandon\r\nhis policy of introducing radical reforms by means of the Autocratic\r\nPower. On the contrary, he gave orders that the preparatory work for\r\ncreating local self-government and reorganising the Law Courts should be\r\npushed on energetically. The important laws for the establishment of the\r\nZemstvo and for the great judicial reforms, which I have described in\r\nprevious chapters, both date from the year 1864.\r\n\r\n     * The students of the St. Petersburg University scandalised\r\n     their more patriotic fellow-countrymen by making a\r\n     pro-Polish demonstration.\r\n\r\n     ** In fairness to Count Muravieff I must say that he was not\r\n     quite so black as he was painted in the Polish and\r\n     West-European Press. He left an interesting autobiographical\r\n     fragment relating to the history of this time, but it is not\r\n     likely to be printed for some years.  As an historical\r\n     document it is valuable, but must be used with caution by\r\n     the future historian.  A copy of it was for some time in my\r\n     possession, but I was bound by a promise not to make\r\n     extracts.\r\n\r\nThese and other reforms of a less important kind made no impression on\r\nthe young irreconcilables. A small group of them, under the leadership\r\nof a certain Ishutin, formed in Moscow a small secret society, and\r\nconceived the design of assassinating the Emperor, in the hope that\r\nhis son and successor, who was erroneously supposed to be imbued with\r\nultra-Liberal ideas, might continue the work which his father had begun\r\nand had not the courage to complete. In April, 1866, the attempt on the\r\nlife of the Emperor was made by a youth called Karakozof as his Majesty\r\nwas leaving a public garden in St. Petersburg, but the bullet happily\r\nmissed its mark, and the culprit was executed.\r\n\r\nThis incident formed a turning-point in the policy of the Government.\r\nAlexander II. began to fear that he had gone too far, or, at least, too\r\nquickly, in his policy of radical reform. An Imperial rescript announced\r\nthat law, property, and religion were in danger, and that the Government\r\nwould lean on the Noblesse and other conservative elements of Society.\r\nThe two periodicals which advocated the most advanced views (Sovremennik\r\nand Russkoye Slovo) were suppressed permanently, and precautions were\r\ntaken to prevent the annual assemblies of the Zemstvo from giving public\r\nexpression to the aspirations of the moderate Liberals.\r\n\r\nA secret official inquiry showed that the revolutionary agitation\r\nproceeded in all cases from young men who were studying, or had recently\r\nstudied, in the universities, the seminaries, or the technical schools,\r\nsuch as the Medical Academy and the Agricultural Institute. Plainly,\r\ntherefore, the system of education was at fault. The semi-military\r\nsystem of the time of Nicholas had been supplanted by one in which\r\ndiscipline was reduced to a minimum and the study of natural science\r\nformed a prominent element. Here it was thought, lay the chief root of\r\nthe evil. Englishmen may have some difficulty in imagining a possible\r\nconnection between natural science and revolutionary agitation. To them\r\nthe two things must seem wide as the poles asunder. Surely mathematics,\r\nchemistry, physiology, and similar subjects have nothing to do with\r\npolitics. When a young Englishman takes to studying any branch of\r\nnatural science he gets up his subject by means of lectures, text-books,\r\nand museums or laboratories, and when he has mastered it he probably\r\nputs his knowledge to some practical use. In Russia it is otherwise. Few\r\nstudents confine themselves to their speciality. The majority of them\r\ndislike the laborious work of mastering dry details, and, with the\r\npresumption which is often found in conjunction with youth and a\r\nsmattering of knowledge, they aspire to become social reformers and\r\nimagine themselves specially qualified for such activity.\r\n\r\nBut what, it may be asked, has social reform to do with natural science?\r\nI have already indicated the connection in the Russian mind. Though very\r\nfew of the students of that time had ever read the voluminous works of\r\nAuguste Comte, they were all more or less imbued with the spirit of\r\nthe Positive Philosophy, in which all the sciences are subsidiary\r\nto sociology, and social reorganisation is the ultimate object of\r\nscientific research. The imaginative Positivist can see with prophetic\r\neye humanity reorganised on strictly scientific principles. Cool-headed\r\npeople who have had a little experience of the world, if they ever\r\nindulge in such delightful dreams, recognise clearly that this ultimate\r\ngoal of human intellectual activity, if it is ever to be reached,\r\nis still a long way off in the misty distance of the future; but the\r\nwould-be social reformers among the Russian students of the sixties were\r\ntoo young, too inexperienced, and too presumptuously self-confident to\r\nrecognise this plain, simple truth. They felt that too much valuable\r\ntime had been already lost, and they were madly impatient to begin\r\nthe great work without further delay. As soon as they had acquired\r\na smattering of chemistry, physiology, and biology they imagined\r\nthemselves capable of reorganising human society from top to bottom, and\r\nwhen they had acquired this conviction they were of course unfitted for\r\nthe patient, plodding study of details.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these evils, Count Dimitri Tolstoy, who was regarded as a\r\npillar of Conservatism, was appointed Minister of Public Instruction,\r\nwith the mission of protecting the young generation against pernicious\r\nideas, and eradicating from the schools, colleges, and universities all\r\nrevolutionary tendencies. He determined to introduce more discipline\r\ninto all the educational establishments and to supplant to a certain\r\nextent the superficial study of natural science by the thorough study of\r\nthe classics--that is to say, Latin and Greek. This scheme, which became\r\nknown before it was actually put into execution, produced a storm of\r\ndiscontent in the young generation. Discipline at that time was regarded\r\nas an antiquated and useless remnant of patriarchal tyranny, and young\r\nmen who were impatient to take part in social reorganisation resented\r\nbeing treated as naughty schoolboys. To them it seemed that the\r\nLatin grammar was an ingenious instrument for stultifying youthful\r\nintelligence, destroying intellectual development, and checking\r\npolitical progress. Ingenious speculations about the possible\r\norganisation of the working classes and grandiose views of the future\r\nof humanity are so much more interesting and agreeable than the rules of\r\nLatin syntax and the Greek irregular verbs!\r\n\r\nCount Tolstoy could congratulate himself on the efficacy of his\r\nadministration, for from the time of his appointment there was a lull in\r\nthe political excitement. During three or four years there was only one\r\npolitical trial, and that an insignificant one; whereas there had been\r\ntwenty between 1861 and 1864, and all more or less important. I am not\r\nat all sure, however, that the educational reform which created\r\nmuch momentary irritation and discontent had anything to do with the\r\nimprovement in the situation. In any case, there were other and more\r\npotent causes at work. The excitement was too intense to be long-lived,\r\nand the fashionable theories too fanciful to stand the wear and tear of\r\neveryday life. They evaporated, therefore, with amazing rapidity when\r\nthe leaders of the movement had disappeared--Tchernishevski and others\r\nby exile, and Dobrolubof and Pissaref by death--and when among the less\r\nprominent representatives of the younger generation many succumbed to\r\nthe sobering influences of time and experience or drifted into lucrative\r\nprofessions. Besides this, the reactionary currents were making\r\nthemselves felt, especially since the attempt on the life of the\r\nEmperor. So long as these had been confined to the official world they\r\nhad not much affected the literature, except externally through\r\nthe Press-censure, but when they permeated the reading public their\r\ninfluence was much stronger. Whatever the cause, there is no doubt that,\r\nin the last years of the sixties, there was a subsidence of excitement\r\nand enthusiasm and the peculiar intellectual phenomenon which had been\r\nnicknamed Nihilism was supposed to be a thing of the past. In reality\r\nthe movement of which Nihilism was a prominent manifestation had merely\r\nlost something of its academic character and was entering on a new stage\r\nof development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nSOCIALIST PROPAGANDA, REVOLUTIONARY AGITATION, AND TERRORISM\r\n\r\n\r\nCloser Relations with Western Socialism--Attempts to Influence\r\nthe Masses--Bakunin and Lavroff--\"Going in among the People\"--The\r\nMissionaries of Revolutionary Socialism--Distinction between Propaganda\r\nand Agitation--Revolutionary Pamphlets for the Common People--Aims\r\nand Motives of the Propagandists--Failure of Propaganda--Energetic\r\nRepression--Fruitless Attempts at Agitation--Proposal to Combine\r\nwith Liberals--Genesis of Terrorism--My Personal Relations with the\r\nRevolutionists--Shadowers and Shadowed--A Series of Terrorist Crimes--A\r\nRevolutionist Congress--Unsuccessful Attempts to Assassinate\r\nthe Tsar--Ineffectual Attempt at Conciliation by Loris\r\nMelikof--Assassination of Alexander II.--The Executive Committee\r\nShows Itself Unpractical--Widespread Indignation and Severe\r\nRepression--Temporary Collapse of the Revolutionary Movement--A New\r\nRevolutionary Movement in Sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Tolstoy\u0027s educational reform had one effect which was not\r\nanticipated: it brought the revolutionists into closer contact with\r\nWestern Socialism. Many students, finding their position in Russia\r\nuncomfortable, determined to go abroad and continue their studies in\r\nforeign universities, where they would be free from the inconveniences\r\nof police supervision and Press-censure. Those of the female sex had\r\nan additional motive to emigrate, because they could not complete their\r\nstudies in Russia, but they had more difficulty in carrying out\r\ntheir intention, because parents naturally disliked the idea of their\r\ndaughters going abroad to lead a Bohemian life, and they very often\r\nobstinately refused to give their consent. In such cases the persistent\r\ndaughter found herself in a dilemma. Though she might run away from\r\nher family and possibly earn her own living, she could not cross\r\nthe frontier without a passport, and without the parental sanction a\r\npassport could not be obtained. Of course she might marry and get the\r\nconsent of her husband, but most of the young ladies objected to the\r\ntrammels of matrimony. Occasionally the problem was solved by means of\r\na fictitious marriage, and when a young man could not be found to\r\nco-operate voluntarily in the arrangement, the Terrorist methods, which\r\nthe revolutionists adopted a few years later for other purposes, might\r\nbe employed. I have heard of at least one case in which an ardent female\r\ndevotee of medical science threatened to shoot a student who was going\r\nabroad if he did not submit to the matrimonial ceremony and allow her to\r\naccompany him to the frontier as his official wife!\r\n\r\nStrange as this story may seem, it contains nothing inherently\r\nimprobable. At that time the energetic young ladies of the Nihilist\r\nschool were not to be diverted from their purpose by trifling obstacles.\r\nWe shall meet some of them hereafter, displaying great courage and\r\ntenacity in revolutionary activity. One of them, for example, attempted\r\nto murder the Prefect of St. Petersburg; and another, a young person of\r\nconsiderable refinement and great personal charm, gave the signal\r\nfor the assassination of Alexander II. and expiated her crime on the\r\nscaffold without the least sign of repentance.\r\n\r\nMost of the studious emigres of both sexes went to Zurich, where female\r\nstudents were admitted to the medical classes. Here they made the\r\nacquaintance of noted Socialists from various countries who had settled\r\nin Switzerland, and being in search of panaceas for social regeneration,\r\nthey naturally fell under their influence, at the same time they read\r\nwith avidity the works of Proudhon, Lassalle, Buchner, Marx, Flerovski,\r\nPfeiffer, and other writers of \"advanced opinions.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the apostles of socialism living at that time in Switzerland they\r\nfound a sympathetic fellow-countryman in the famous Anarchist, Bakunin,\r\nwho had succeeded in escaping from Siberia. His ideal was the\r\nimmediate overthrow of all existing Governments, the destruction of\r\nall administrative organisation, the abolition of all bourgeois\r\ninstitutions, and the establishment of an entirely new order of things\r\non the basis of a free federation of productive Communes, in which all\r\nthe land should be distributed among those capable of tilling it and the\r\ninstruments of production confided to co-operative associations. Efforts\r\nto obtain mere political reforms, even of the most radical type, were\r\nregarded by him with contempt as miserable palliatives, which could be\r\nof no real, permanent benefit to the masses, and might be positively\r\ninjurious by prolonging the present era of bourgeois domination.\r\n\r\nFor the dissemination of these principles a special organ called The\r\nCause of the People (Narodnoye Dyelo) was founded in Geneva in 1868 and\r\nwas smuggled across the Russian frontier in considerable quantities.\r\nIt aimed at drawing away the young generation from Academic Nihilism to\r\nmore practical revolutionary activity, but it evidently remained to some\r\nextent under the old influences, for it indulged occasionally in very\r\nabstract philosophical disquisitions. In its first number, for example,\r\nit published a programme in which the editors thought it necessary to\r\ndeclare that they were materialists and atheists, because the belief\r\nin God and a future life, as well as every other kind of idealism,\r\ndemoralises the people, inspiring it with mutually contradictory\r\naspirations, and thereby depriving it of the energy necessary for\r\nthe conquest of its natural rights in this world, and the complete\r\norganisation of a free and happy life. At the end of two years this\r\norgan for moralising the people collapsed from want of funds, but other\r\nperiodicals and pamphlets were printed, and the clandestine relations\r\nbetween the exiles in Switzerland and their friends in St. Petersburg\r\nwere maintained without difficulty, notwithstanding the efforts of the\r\npolice to cut the connection. In this way Young Russia became more and\r\nmore saturated with the extreme Socialist theories current in Western\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThanks partly to this foreign influence and partly to their own\r\npractical experience, the would-be reformers who remained at home came\r\nto understand that academic talking and discussing could bring about no\r\nserious results. Students alone, however numerous and however devoted to\r\nthe cause, could not hope to overthrow or coerce the Government. It was\r\nchildish to suppose that the walls of the autocratic Jericho would fall\r\nby the blasts of academic trumpets. Attempts at revolution could not be\r\nsuccessful without the active support of the people, and consequently\r\nthe revolutionary agitation must be extended to the masses. So far there\r\nwas complete agreement among the revolutionists, but with regard to the\r\nmodus operandi emphatic differences of opinion appeared. Those who were\r\ncarried away by the stirring accents of Bakunin imagined that if\r\nthe masses could only be made to feel themselves the victims of\r\nadministrative and economic oppression, they would rise and free\r\nthemselves by a united effort. According to this view all that was\r\nrequired was that popular discontent should be excited and that\r\nprecautions should be taken to ensure that the explosions of discontent\r\nshould take place simultaneously all over the country. The rest might\r\nsafely be left, it was thought, to the operation of natural forces and\r\nthe inspiration of the moment. Against this dangerous illusion warning\r\nvoices were raised. Lavroff, for example, while agreeing with Bakunin\r\nthat mere political reforms were of little or no value, and that any\r\ngenuine improvement in the condition of the working classes could\r\nproceed only from economic and social reorganisation, maintained\r\nstoutly that the revolution, to be permanent and beneficial, must be\r\naccomplished, not by demagogues directing the ignorant masses, but by\r\nthe people as a whole, after it had been enlightened and instructed as\r\nto its true interests. The preparatory work would necessarily require a\r\nwhole generation of educated propagandists, living among the labouring\r\npopulation rural and urban.\r\n\r\nFor some time there was a conflict between these two currents of\r\nopinion, but the views of Lavroff, which were simply a practical\r\ndevelopment of academic Nihilism, gained far more adherents than the\r\nviolent anarchical proposals of Bakunin, and finally the grandiose\r\nscheme of realising gradually the Socialist ideal by indoctrinating the\r\nmasses was adopted with enthusiasm. In St. Petersburg, Moscow and other\r\nlarge towns the student association for mutual instruction, to which\r\nI have referred in the foregoing chapter, became centres of popular\r\npropaganda, and the academic Nihilists were transformed into active\r\nmissionaries. Scores of male and female students, impatient to convert\r\nthe masses to the gospel of freedom and terrestrial felicity, sought\r\nto get into touch with the common people by settling in the villages as\r\nschool-teachers, medical practitioners, midwives, etc., or by working\r\nas common factory hands in the industrial centres. In order to obtain\r\nemployment in the factories and conceal their real purpose, they\r\nprocured false passports, in which they were described as belonging\r\nto the lower classes; and even those who settled in the villages lived\r\ngenerally under assumed names. Thus was formed a class of professional\r\nrevolutionists, sometimes called the Illegals, who were liable to be\r\narrested at any moment by the police. As compensation for the privations\r\nand hardships which they had to endure, they had the consolation of\r\nbelieving that they were advancing the good cause. The means they\r\nusually employed were formal conversations and pamphlets expressly\r\nwritten for the purpose. The more enthusiastic and persevering of\r\nthese missionaries would continue their efforts for months and years,\r\nremaining in communication with the headquarters in the capital or some\r\nprovincial town in order to report progress, obtain a fresh supply of\r\npamphlets, and get their forged passports renewed. This extraordinary\r\nmovement was called \"going in among the people,\" and it spread among the\r\nyoung generation like an epidemic. In 1873 it was suddenly reinforced\r\nby a detachment of fresh recruits. Over a hundred Russian students were\r\nrecalled by the Government from Switzerland, in order to save them from\r\nthe baneful influence of Bakunin, Lavroff, and other noted Socialists,\r\nand a large proportion of them joined the ranks of the propagandists.*\r\n\r\n     * Instances of going in among the people had happened as\r\n     early as 1864, but they did not become frequent till after\r\n     1870.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the aims and methods of the propagandists, a good deal of\r\ninformation was obtained in the course of a judicial inquiry instituted\r\nin 1875. A peasant, who was at the same time a factory worker, informed\r\nthe police that certain persons were distributing revolutionary\r\npamphlets among the factory-hands, and as a proof of what he said he\r\nproduced some pamphlets which he had himself received. This led to\r\nan investigation, which showed that a number of young men and women,\r\nevidently belonging to the educated classes, were disseminating\r\nrevolutionary ideas by means of pamphlets and conversation. Arrests\r\nfollowed, and it was soon discovered that these agitators belonged to\r\na large secret association, which had its centre in Moscow and local\r\nbranches in Ivanovo, Tula, and Kief. In Ivanovo, for instance--a\r\nmanufacturing town about a hundred miles to the northeast of Moscow--the\r\npolice found a small apartment inhabited by three young men and four\r\nyoung women, all of whom, though belonging by birth to the educated\r\nclasses, had the appearance of ordinary factory workers, prepared their\r\nown food, did with their own hands all the domestic work, and sought\r\nto avoid everything which could distinguish them from the labouring\r\npopulation. In the apartment were found 240 copies of revolutionary\r\npamphlets, a considerable sum of money, a large amount of correspondence\r\nin cypher, and several forged passports.\r\n\r\nHow many persons the society contained, it is impossible to say, because\r\na large portion of them eluded the vigilance of the police; but many\r\nwere arrested, and ultimately forty-seven were condemned. Of these,\r\neleven were noble, seven were sons of parish priests, and the remainder\r\nbelong to the lower classes--that is to say, the small officials,\r\nburghers, and peasants. The average age of the prisoners was\r\ntwenty-four, the oldest being thirty-six and the youngest under\r\nseventeen! Only five or six were over twenty-five, and none of these\r\nwere ringleaders. The female element was represented by no less than\r\nfifteen young persons, whose ages were on an average under twenty-two.\r\nTwo of these, to judge by their photographs, were of refined,\r\nprepossessing appearance, and seemingly little fitted for taking part in\r\nwholesale massacres such as the society talked of organising.\r\n\r\nThe character and aims of the society were clearly depicted in the\r\ndocumentary and oral evidence produced at the trial. According to the\r\nfundamental principles, there should exist among the members absolute\r\nequality, complete mutual responsibility and full frankness and\r\nconfidence with regard to the affairs of the association. Among the\r\nconditions of admission we find that the candidate should devote himself\r\nentirely to revolutionary activity; that he should be ready to sever\r\nall ties, whether of friendship or of love, for the good cause; that\r\nhe should possess great powers of self-sacrifice and the capacity for\r\nkeeping secrets; and that he should consent to become, when necessary,\r\na common labourer in a factory. The desire to maintain absolute equality\r\nis well illustrated by the article of the statutes regarding the\r\nadministration: the office-bearers are not to be chosen by election,\r\nbut all members are to be office-bearers in turn, and the term of office\r\nmust not exceed one month!\r\n\r\nThe avowed aim of the society was to destroy the existing social order,\r\nand to replace it by one in which there should be no private property\r\nand no distinctions of class or wealth; or, as it is expressed in one\r\ndocument, \"to found on the ruins of the present social organisation the\r\nEmpire of the working classes.\" The means to be employed were indicated\r\nin a general way, but each member was to adapt himself to circumstances\r\nand was to devote all his energy to forwarding the cause of the\r\nrevolution. For the guidance of the inexperienced, the following means\r\nwere recommended: simple conversations, dissemination of pamphlets, the\r\nexciting of discontent, the formation of organised groups, the creation\r\nof funds and libraries. These, taken together, constitute, in the\r\nterminology of revolutionary science, \"propaganda,\" and in addition to\r\nit there should be \"agitation.\" The technical distinction between these\r\ntwo processes is that propaganda has a purely preparatory character, and\r\naims merely at enlightening the masses regarding the true nature of the\r\nrevolutionary cause, whereas agitation aims at exciting an individual\r\nor a group to acts which are considered, in the existing regime, as\r\nillegal. In time of peace \"pure agitation\" was to be carried on by\r\nmeans of organised bands which should frighten the Government and the\r\nprivileged classes, draw away the attention of the authorities from less\r\novert kinds of revolutionary action, raise the spirit of the people\r\nand thereby render it more accessible to revolutionary ideas, obtain\r\npecuniary means for further activity, and liberate political prisoners.\r\nIn time of insurrection the members should give to all movements every\r\nassistance in their power, and impress on them a Socialistic character.\r\nThe central administration and the local branches should establish\r\nrelations with publishers, and take steps to secure a regular supply\r\nof prohibited books from abroad. Such are a few characteristic\r\nextracts from a document which might fairly be called a treatise on\r\nrevolutionology.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the revolutionary pamphlets circulated by the\r\npropagandists and agitators I may give here a brief account of one which\r\nis well known to the political police. It is entitled Khitraya Mekhanika\r\n(Cunning Machinery), and gives a graphic picture of the ideas and\r\nmethods employed. The mise en scene is extremely simple. Two peasants,\r\nStepan and Andrei, are represented as meeting in a gin-shop and drinking\r\ntogether. Stepan is described as good and kindly when he has to do\r\nwith men of his own class, but very sharp-tongued when speaking with\r\na foreman or manager. Always ready with an answer, he can on occasions\r\nsilence even an official! He has travelled all over the Empire, has\r\nassociated with all sorts and conditions of men, sees everything most\r\nclearly, and is, in short, a very remarkable man. One of his excellent\r\nqualities is that, being \"enlightened\" himself, he is always ready to\r\nenlighten others, and he now finds an opportunity of displaying his\r\npowers. When Andrei, who is still unenlightened, proposes that they\r\nshould drink another glass of vodka, he replies that the Tsar, together\r\nwith the nobles and traders, bars the way to the throat. As his\r\ncompanion does not understand this metaphorical language, he explains\r\nthat if there were no Tsars, nobles, or traders, he could get five\r\nglasses of vodka for the sum that he now pays for one glass. This\r\nnaturally suggests wider topics, and Stepan gives something like a\r\nlecture. The common people, he explains, pay by far the greater part\r\nof the taxation, and at the same time do all the work; they plough the\r\nfields, build the houses and churches, work in the mills and factories,\r\nand in return they are systematically robbed and beaten. And what is\r\ndone with all the money that is taken from them? First of all, the Tsar\r\ngets nine millions of roubles--enough to feed half a province--and\r\nwith that sum he amuses himself, has hunting-parties, and feasts, eats,\r\ndrinks, makes merry, and lives in stone houses. He gave liberty, it is\r\ntrue, to the peasants; but we know what the Emancipation really was. The\r\nbest land was taken away and the taxes were increased, lest the\r\nmuzhik should get fat and lazy. The Tsar is himself the richest landed\r\nproprietor and manufacturer in the country. He not only robs us as much\r\nas he pleases, but he has sold into slavery (by forming a national debt)\r\nour children and grandchildren. He takes our sons as soldiers, shuts\r\nthem up in barracks so that they should not see their brother-peasants,\r\nand hardens their hearts so that they become wild beasts, ready to rend\r\ntheir parents. The nobles and traders likewise rob the poor peasants. In\r\nshort, all the upper classes have invented a bit of cunning machinery\r\nby which the muzhik is made to pay for their pleasures and luxuries. The\r\npeople will one day rise and break this machinery to pieces. When that\r\nday comes they must break every part of it, for if one bit escapes\r\ndestruction all the other parts of it will immediately grow up again.\r\nAll the force is on the side of the peasants, if they only knew how\r\nto use it. Knowledge will come in time. They will then destroy this\r\nmachine, and perceive that the only real remedy for all social evils is\r\nbrotherhood. People should live like brothers, having no mine and thine,\r\nbut all things in common. When we have created brotherhood, there will\r\nbe no riches and no thieves, but right and righteousness without end. In\r\nconclusion, Stepan addresses a word to \"the torturers\": \"When the\r\npeople rise, the Tsar will send troops against us, and the nobles and\r\ncapitalists will stake their last rouble on the result. If they do not\r\nsucceed, they must not expect any quarter from us. They may conquer us\r\nonce or twice, but we shall at last get our own, for there is no power\r\nthat can withstand the whole people. Then we shall cleanse the country\r\nof our persecutors, and establish a brotherhood in which there will\r\nbe no mine and thine, but all will work for the common weal. We shall\r\nconstruct no cunning machinery, but shall pluck up evil by the roots,\r\nand establish eternal justice!\"\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned distinction between Propaganda and Agitation, which\r\nplays a considerable part in revolutionary literature, had at that time\r\nmore theoretical than practical importance. The great majority of\r\nthose who took an active part in the movement confined their efforts\r\nto indoctrinating the masses with Socialistic and subversive ideas, and\r\nsometimes their methods were rather childish. As an illustration I\r\nmay cite an amusing incident related by one of the boldest and most\r\ntenacious of the revolutionists, who subsequently acquired a certain\r\nsense of humour. He and a friend were walking one day on a country road,\r\nwhen they were overtaken by a peasant in his cart. Ever anxious to sow\r\nthe good seed, they at once entered into conversation with the rustic,\r\ntelling him that he ought not to pay his taxes, because the tchinovniks\r\nrobbed the people, and trying to convince him by quotations from\r\nScripture that he ought to resist the authorities. The prudent muzhik\r\nwhipped up his horse and tried to get out of hearing, but the two\r\nzealots ran after him and continued the sermon till they were completely\r\nout of breath. Other propagandists were more practical, and preached\r\na species of agrarian socialism which the rural population could\r\nunderstand. At the time of the Emancipation the peasants were convinced\r\nas I have mentioned in a previous chapter, that the Tsar meant to give\r\nthem all the land, and to compensate the landed proprietors by salaries.\r\nEven when the law was read and explained to them, they clung obstinately\r\nto their old convictions, and confidently expected that the REAL\r\nEmancipation would be proclaimed shortly. Taking advantage of this state\r\nof things, the propagandists to whom I refer confirmed the peasants\r\nin their error, and sought in this way to sow discontent against the\r\nproprietors and the Government. Their watchword was \"Land and Liberty,\"\r\nand they formed for a good many years a distinct group, under that title\r\n(Zemlya i Volya, or more briefly Zemlevoltsi).\r\n\r\nIn the St. Petersburg group, which aspired to direct and control this\r\nmovement, there were one or two men who held different views as to the\r\nreal object of propaganda and agitation. One of these, Prince Krapotkin,\r\nhas told the world what his object was at that time. He hoped that the\r\nGovernment would be frightened and that the Autocratic Power, as in\r\nFrance on the eve of the Revolution, would seek support in the landed\r\nproprietors, and call together a National Assembly. Thus a constitution\r\nwould be granted, and though the first Assembly might be conservative\r\nin spirit, autocracy would be compelled in the long run to yield to\r\nparliamentary pressure.\r\n\r\nNo such elaborate projects were entertained, I believe, by the majority\r\nof the propagandists. Their reasoning was much simpler: \"The Government,\r\nhaving become reactionary, tries to prevent us from enlightening the\r\npeople; we will do it in spite of the Government!\" The dangers to which\r\nthey exposed themselves only confirmed them in their resolution. Though\r\nthey honestly believed themselves to be Realists and Materialists, they\r\nwere at heart romantic Idealists, panting to do something heroic. They\r\nhad been taught by the apostles whom they venerated, from Belinski\r\ndownwards, that the man who simply talks about the good of the people,\r\nand does nothing to promote it, is among the most contemptible of human\r\nbeings. No such reproach must be addressed to them. If the Government\r\nopposed and threatened, that was no excuse for inactivity. They must be\r\nup and doing. \"Forward! forward! Let us plunge into the people, identify\r\nourselves with them, and work for their benefit! Suffering is in\r\nstore for us, but we must endure it with fortitude!\" The type which\r\nTchernishevski had depicted in his famous novel, under the name of\r\nRakhmetof--the youth who led an ascetic life and subjected himself\r\nto privation and suffering as a preparation for future revolutionary\r\nactivity--now appeared in the flesh. If we may credit Bakunin, these\r\nRakhmetofs had not even the consolation of believing in the possibility\r\nof a revolution, but as they could not and would not remain passive\r\nspectators of the misfortunes of the people, they resolved to go\r\nin among the masses in order to share with them fraternally\r\ntheir sufferings, and at the same time to teach and prepare, not\r\ntheoretically, but practically by their living example.* This is, I\r\nbelieve, an exaggeration. The propagandists were, for the most part of\r\nincredibly sanguine temperament.\r\n\r\n     * Bakunin: \"Gosudarstvennost\u0027 i Anarkhiya\" (\"State\r\n     Organisation and Anarchy\"), Zurich, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe success of the propaganda and agitation was not at all in proportion\r\nto the numbers and enthusiasm of those who took part in it. Most\r\nof these displayed more zeal than mother-wit and discretion. Their\r\nSocialism was too abstract and scientific to be understood by rustics,\r\nand when they succeeded in making themselves intelligible they awakened\r\nin their hearers more suspicion than sympathy. The muzhik is a very\r\nmatter-of-fact practical person, totally incapable of understanding what\r\nAmericans call \"hifalutin\" tendencies in speech and conduct, and as\r\nhe listened to the preaching of the new Gospel doubts and questionings\r\nspontaneously rose in his mind: \"What do those young people, who betray\r\ntheir gentlefolk origin by their delicate white hands, their foreign\r\nphrases, their ignorance of the common things of everyday peasant life,\r\nreally want? Why are they bearing hardships and taking so much\r\ntrouble? They tell us it is for our good, but we are not such fools and\r\nsimpletons as they take us for. They are not doing it all for nothing.\r\nWhat do they expect from us in return? Whatever it is, they are\r\nevidently evil-doers, and perhaps moshenniki (swindlers). Devil take\r\nthem!\" and thereupon the cautious muzhik turns his back upon his\r\ndisinterested self-sacrificing teachers, or goes quietly and denounces\r\nthem to the police! It is not only in Spain that we encounter Don\r\nQuixotes and Sancho Panzas!\r\n\r\nOccasionally a worse fate befell the missionaries. If they allowed\r\nthemselves, as they sometimes did, to \"blaspheme\" against religion or\r\nthe Tsar, they ran the risk of being maltreated on the spot. I have\r\nheard of one case in which the punishment for blasphemy was applied by\r\nsturdy peasant matrons. Even when they escaped such mishaps they had\r\nnot much reason to congratulate themselves on their success. After three\r\nyears of arduous labour the hundreds of apostles could not boast of more\r\nthan a score or two of converts among the genuine working classes, and\r\neven these few did not all remain faithful unto death. Some of them,\r\nhowever, it must be admitted, laboured and suffered to the end with the\r\ncourage and endurance of true martyrs.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the indifference or hostility of the masses that the\r\npropagandists had to complain of. The police soon got on their track,\r\nand did not confine themselves to persuasion and logical arguments.\r\nTowards the end of 1873 they arrested some members of the central\r\ndirectory group in St. Petersburg, and in the following May they\r\ndiscovered in the province of Saratof an affiliated organisation\r\nwith which nearly 800 persons were connected, about one-fifth of them\r\nbelonging to the female sex. A few came of well-to-do families--sons and\r\ndaughters of minor officials or small landed proprietors--but the great\r\nmajority were poor students of humbler origin, a large contingent being\r\nsupplied by the sons of the poor parish clergy. In other provinces the\r\nauthorities made similar discoveries. Before the end of the year a large\r\nproportion of the propagandists were in prison, and the centralised\r\norganisation, so far as such a thing existed, was destroyed. Gradually\r\nit dawned on the minds even of the Don Quixotes that pacific propaganda\r\nwas no longer possible, and that attempts to continue it could lead only\r\nto useless sacrifices.\r\n\r\nFor a time there was universal discouragement in the revolutionary\r\nranks; and among those who had escaped arrest there were mutual\r\nrecriminations and endless discussions about the causes of failure and\r\nthe changes to be made in modes of action. The practical results of\r\nthese recriminations and discussions was that the partisans of a slow,\r\npacific propaganda retired to the background, and the more impatient\r\nrevolutionary agitators took possession of the movement. These\r\nmaintained stoutly that as pacific propaganda had become impossible,\r\nstronger methods must be adopted. The masses must be organised so as\r\nto offer successful resistance to the Government. Conspiracies must\r\ntherefore be formed, local disorders provoked, and blood made to flow.\r\nThe part of the country which seemed best adapted for experiments of\r\nthis kind was the southern and southeastern region, inhabited by\r\nthe descendants of the turbulent Cossack population which had raised\r\nformidable insurrections under Stenka Razin and Pugatcheff in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Here, then, the more impatient\r\nagitators began their work. A Kief group called the Buntari (rioters),\r\ncomposed of about twenty-five individuals, settled in various localities\r\nas small shopkeepers or horse dealers, or went about as workmen or\r\npeddlers. One member of the group has given us in his reminiscences an\r\namusing account of the experiment. Everywhere the agitators found the\r\npeasants suspicious and inhospitable, and consequently they had to\r\nsuffer a great deal of discomfort. Some of them at once gave up the\r\ntask as hopeless. The others settled in a village and began operations.\r\nHaving made a topographic survey of the locality, they worked out an\r\ningenious plan of campaign; but they had no recruits for the future army\r\nof insurrection, and if they had been able to get recruits, they had no\r\narms for them, and no money wherewith to purchase arms or anything else.\r\nIn these circumstances they gravely appointed a committee to collect\r\nfunds, knowing very well that no money would be forthcoming. It was\r\nas if a shipwrecked crew in an open boat, having reached the brink of\r\nstarvation, appointed a committee to obtain a supply of fresh water and\r\nprovisions! In the hope of obtaining assistance from headquarters, a\r\ndelegate was sent to St. Petersburg and Moscow to explain that for the\r\narming of the population about a quarter of a million of roubles was\r\nrequired. The delegate brought back thirty second-hand revolvers! The\r\nrevolutionist who confesses all this* recognises that the whole scheme\r\nwas childishly unpractical: \"We chose the path of popular insurrection\r\nbecause we had faith in the revolutionary spirit of the masses, in its\r\npower and its invincibility. That was the weak side of our position; and\r\nthe most curious part of it was that we drew proofs in support of\r\nour theory from history--from the abortive insurrections of Pazin and\r\nPugatcheff, which took place in an age when the Government had only a\r\nsmall regular army and no railways or telegraphs! We did not even think\r\nof attempting a propaganda among the military!\" In the district of\r\nTchigirin the agitators had a little momentary success, but the result\r\nwas the same. There a student called Stefanovitch pretended that the\r\nTsar was struggling with the officials to benefit the peasantry, and he\r\nshowed the simple rustics a forged imperial manifesto in which they were\r\nordered to form a society for the purpose of raising an insurrection\r\nagainst the officials, the nobles, and the priests. At one moment\r\n(April, 1877), the society had about 600 members, but a few months\r\nlater it was discovered by the police, and the leaders and peasants were\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n     * Debogorio-Mokrievitch.  \"Vospominaniya\" (\"Reminiscences\").\r\n     Paris, 1894-99.\r\n\r\nWhen it had thus become evident that propaganda and agitation were alike\r\nuseless, and when numerous arrests were being made daily, it became\r\nnecessary for the revolutionists to reconsider their position, and some\r\nof the more moderate proposed to rally to the Liberals, as a temporary\r\nmeasure. Hitherto there had been very little sympathy and a good deal of\r\nopenly avowed hostility between Liberals and revolutionists. The latter,\r\nconvinced that they could overthrow the Autocratic Power by their own\r\nunaided efforts, had looked askance at Liberalism because they believed\r\nthat parliamentary discussions and party struggles would impede rather\r\nthan facilitate the advent of the Socialist Millennium, and strengthen\r\nthe domination of the bourgeoisie without really improving the condition\r\nof the masses. Now, however, when the need of allies was felt, it seemed\r\nthat constitutional government might be used as a stepping-stone for\r\nreaching the Socialist ideal, because it must grant a certain liberty\r\nof the Press and of association, and it would necessarily abolish the\r\nexisting autocratic system of arresting, imprisoning and exiling, on\r\nmere suspicion, without any regular form of legal procedure. As usual,\r\nan appeal was made to history, and arguments were easily found in favour\r\nof this course of action. The past of other nations had shown that in\r\nthe march of progress there are no sudden leaps and bounds, and it was\r\ntherefore absurd to imagine, as the revolutionists had hitherto done,\r\nthat Russian Autocracy could be swallowed by Socialism at a gulp.\r\nThere must always be periods of transition, and it seemed that such a\r\ntransition period might now be initiated. Liberalism might be allowed to\r\ndestroy, or at least weaken, Autocracy, and then it might be destroyed\r\nin its turn by Socialism of the most advanced type.\r\n\r\nHaving adopted this theory of gradual historic development, some of the\r\nmore practical revolutionists approached the more advanced Liberals\r\nand urged them to more energetic action; but before anything could be\r\narranged the more impatient revolutionists--notably the group called\r\nthe Narodovoltsi (National-will-ists)--intervened, denounced what they\r\nconsidered an unholy alliance, and proposed a policy of terrorism\r\nby which the Government would be frightened into a more conciliatory\r\nattitude. Their idea was that the officials who displayed most zeal\r\nagainst the revolutionary movement should be assassinated, and that\r\nevery act of severity on the part of the Administration should be\r\nanswered by an act of \"revolutionary justice.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was evident that the choice between these two courses of action\r\nmust determine in great measure the future character and ultimate fate\r\nof the movement, there was much discussion between the two groups; but\r\nthe question did not long remain in suspense. Soon the extreme party\r\ngained the upper hand, and the Terrorist policy was adopted. I shall let\r\nthe revolutionists themselves explain this momentous decision. In a long\r\nproclamation published some years later it is explained thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The revolutionary movement in Russia began with the so-called \u0027going\r\nin among the people.\u0027 The first Russian revolutionists thought that the\r\nfreedom of the people could be obtained only by the people itself, and\r\nthey imagined that the only thing necessary was that the people should\r\nabsorb Socialistic ideas. To this it was supposed that the peasantry\r\nwere naturally inclined, because they already possess, in the rural\r\nCommune, institutions which contain the seeds of Socialism, and which\r\nmight serve as a basis for the reconstruction of society according to\r\nSocialist principles. The propagandists hoped, therefore, that in the\r\nteachings of West European Socialism the people would recognise its own\r\ninstinctive creations in riper and more clearly defined forms and that\r\nit would joyfully accept the new teaching.\r\n\r\n\"But the people did not understand its friends, and showed itself\r\nhostile to them. It turned out that institutions born in slavery could\r\nnot serve as a foundation for the new construction, and that the man who\r\nwas yesterday a serf, though capable of taking part in disturbances, is\r\nnot fitted for conscious revolutionary work. With pain in their heart\r\nthe revolutionists had to confess that they were deceived in their hopes\r\nof the people. Around them were no social revolutionary forces on which\r\nthey could lean for support, and yet they could not reconcile themselves\r\nwith the existing state of violence and slavery. Thereupon awakened a\r\nlast hope--the hope of a drowning man who clutches at a straw: a little\r\ngroup of heroic and self-sacrificing individuals might accomplish with\r\ntheir own strength the difficult task of freeing Russia from the yoke\r\nof autocracy. They had to do it themselves, because there was no other\r\nmeans. But would they be able to accomplish it? For them that question\r\ndid not exist. The struggle of that little group against autocracy was\r\nlike the heroic means on which a doctor decides when there is no longer\r\nany hope of the patient\u0027s recovery. Terrorism was the only means that\r\nremained, and it had the advantage of giving a natural vent to pent-up\r\nfeelings, and of seeming a reaction against the cruel persecutions of\r\nthe Government. The party called the Narodnaya Volya (National Will)\r\nwas accordingly formed, and during several years the world witnessed\r\na spectacle that had never been seen before in history. The Narodnaya\r\nVolya, insignificant in numbers but strong in spirit, engaged in single\r\ncombat with the powerful Russian Government. Neither executions, nor\r\nimprisonment with hard labour, nor ordinary imprisonment and exile,\r\ndestroyed the energy of the revolutionists. Under their shots fell,\r\none after the other, the most zealous and typical representatives of\r\narbitrary action and violence. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, in 1877, when propaganda and agitation among the\r\nmasses were being abandoned for the system of terrorism, but before any\r\nassassinations had taken place, that I accidentally came into personal\r\nrelations with some prominent adherents of the revolutionary movement.\r\nOne day a young man of sympathetic appearance, whom I did not know and\r\nwho brought no credentials, called on me in St. Petersburg and suggested\r\nto me that I might make public through the English Press what he\r\ndescribed as a revolting act of tyranny and cruelty committed by General\r\nTrepof, the Prefect of the city. That official, he said, in visiting\r\nrecently one of the prisons, had noticed that a young political prisoner\r\ncalled Bogolubof did not salute him as he passed, and he had ordered him\r\nto be flogged in consequence. To this I replied that I had no reason to\r\ndisbelieve the story, but that I had equally no reason to accept it as\r\naccurate, as it rested solely on the evidence of a person with whom I\r\nwas totally unacquainted. My informant took the objection in good part,\r\nand offered me the names and addresses of a number of persons who could\r\nsupply me with any proofs that I might desire.\r\n\r\nAt his next visit I told him I had seen several of the persons he had\r\nnamed, and that I could not help perceiving that they were closely\r\nconnected with the revolutionary movement. I then went on to suggest\r\nthat as the sympathisers with that movement constantly complained that\r\nthey were systematically misrepresented, calumniated and caricatured,\r\nthe leaders ought to give the world an accurate account of their real\r\ndoctrines, and in this respect I should be glad to assist them.\r\nAlready I knew something of the subject, because I had many friends\r\nand acquaintances among the sympathisers, and had often had with them\r\ninterminable discussions. With their ideas, so far as I knew them, I\r\nfelt bound to confess that I had no manner of sympathy, but I flattered\r\nmyself, and he himself had admitted, that I was capable of describing\r\naccurately and criticising impartially doctrines with which I did not\r\nagree. My new acquaintance, whom I may call Dimitry Ivan\u0027itch, was\r\npleased with the proposal, and after he had consulted with some of\r\nhis friends, we came to an agreement by which I should receive all the\r\nmaterials necessary for writing an accurate account of the doctrinal\r\nside of the movement. With regard to any conspiracies that might be in\r\nprogress, I warned him that he must be strictly reticent, because if I\r\ncame accidentally to know of any terrorist designs, I should consider\r\nit my duty to warn the authorities. For this reason I declined to attend\r\nany secret conclaves, and it was agreed that I should be instructed\r\nwithout being initiated.\r\n\r\nThe first step in my instruction was not very satisfactory or\r\nencouraging. One day Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch brought me a large manuscript,\r\nwhich contained, he said, the real doctrines of the revolutionists and\r\nthe explanation of their methods. I was surprised to find that it was\r\nwritten in English, and I perceived at a glance that it was not at all\r\nwhat I wanted. As soon as I had read the first sentence I turned to my\r\nfriend and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry to find, Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch, that you have not kept your\r\npart of the bargain. We agreed, you may remember, that we were to act\r\ntowards each other in absolutely good faith, and here I find a flagrant\r\nbit of bad faith in the very first sentence of the manuscript which\r\nyou have brought me. The document opens with the statement that a large\r\nnumber of students have been arrested and imprisoned for distributing\r\nbooks among the people. That statement may be true according to the\r\nletter, but it is evidently intended to mislead. These youths have been\r\narrested, as you must know, not for distributing ordinary books, as the\r\nmemorandum suggests, but for distributing books of a certain kind. I\r\nhave read some of them, and I cannot feel at all surprised that the\r\nGovernment should object to their being put into the hands of the\r\nignorant masses. Take, for example, the one entitled Khitraya Mekhanika,\r\nand others of the same type. The practical teaching they contain is that\r\nthe peasants should be ready to rise and cut the throats of the landed\r\nproprietors and officials. Now, a wholesale massacre of the kind may\r\nor may not be desirable in the interests of Society, and justifiable\r\naccording to some new code of higher morality. That is a question\r\ninto which I do not enter. All I maintain is that the writer of this\r\nmemorandum, in speaking of \u0027books,\u0027 meant to mislead me.\"\r\n\r\nDimitri Ivan\u0027itch looked puzzled and ashamed. \"Forgive me,\" he said; \"I\r\nam to blame--not for having attempted to deceive you, but for not having\r\ntaken precautions. I have not read the manuscript, and I could not if\r\nI wished, for it is written in English, and I know no language but my\r\nmother tongue. My friends ought not to have done this. Give me back the\r\npaper, and I shall take care that nothing of the sort occurs in future.\"\r\n\r\nThis promise was faithfully kept, and I had no further reason\r\nto complain. Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch gave me a considerable amount of\r\ninformation, and lent me a valuable collection of revolutionary\r\npamphlets. Unfortunately the course of tuition was suddenly interrupted\r\nby unforeseen circumstances, which I may mention as characteristic\r\nof life in St. Petersburg at the time. My servant, an excellent young\r\nRussian, more honest than intelligent, came to me one morning with a\r\nmysterious air, and warned me to be on my guard, because there were \"bad\r\npeople\" going about. On being pressed a little, he explained to me what\r\nhe meant. Two strangers had come to him and, after offering him a few\r\nroubles, had asked him a number of questions about my habits--at what\r\nhour I went out and came home, what persons called on me, and much more\r\nof the same sort. \"They even tried, sir, to get into your sitting-room;\r\nbut of course I did not allow them. I believe they want to rob you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult to guess who these \"bad people\" were who took such\r\na keen interest in my doings, and who wanted to examine my apartment in\r\nmy absence. Any doubts I had on the subject were soon removed. On\r\nthe morrow and following days I noticed that whenever I went out,\r\nand wherever I might walk or drive, I was closely followed by two\r\nunsympathetic-looking individuals--so closely that when I turned round\r\nsharp they ran into me. The first and second times this little accident\r\noccurred they received a strong volley of unceremonious vernacular;\r\nbut when we became better acquainted we simply smiled at each other\r\nknowingly, as the old Roman Augurs are supposed to have done when they\r\nmet in public unobserved. There was no longer any attempt at concealment\r\nor mystification. I knew I was being shadowed, and the shadowers could\r\nnot help perceiving that I knew it. Yet, strange to say, they were never\r\nchanged!\r\n\r\nThe reader probably assumes that the secret police had somehow got wind\r\nof my relations with the revolutionists. Such an assumption presupposes\r\non the part of the police an amount of intelligence and perspicacity\r\nwhich they do not usually possess. On this occasion they were on\r\nan entirely wrong scent, and the very day when I first noticed my\r\nshadowers, a high official, who seemed to regard the whole thing as\r\na good joke, told me confidentially what the wrong scent was. At the\r\ninstigation of an ex-ambassador, from whom I had the misfortune to\r\ndiffer in matters of foreign policy, the Moscow Gazette had denounced me\r\npublicly by name as a person who was in the habit of visiting daily the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs--doubtless with the nefarious purpose of\r\nobtaining by illegal means secret political information--and the police\r\nhad concluded that I was a fit and proper person to be closely watched.\r\nIn reality, my relations with the Russian Foreign Office, though\r\ninconvenient to the ex-ambassador, were perfectly regular and\r\nabove-board--sanctioned, in fact, by Prince Gortchakoff--but the\r\nindelicate attentions of the secret police were none the less extremely\r\nunwelcome, because some intelligent police-agent might get onto the real\r\nscent, and cause me serious inconvenience. I determined, therefore,\r\nto break off all relations with Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch and his friends, and\r\npostpone my studies to a more convenient season; but that decision\r\ndid not entirely extricate me from my difficulties. The collection of\r\nrevolutionary pamphlets was still in my possession, and I had promised\r\nto return it. For some little time I did not see how I could keep my\r\npromise without compromising myself or others, but at last--after having\r\nhad my shadowers carefully shadowed in order to learn accurately their\r\nhabits, and having taken certain elaborate precautions, with which I\r\nneed not trouble the reader, as he is not likely ever to require them--I\r\npaid a visit secretly to Dimitri Ivan\u0027itch in his small room, almost\r\ndestitute of furniture, handed him the big parcel of pamphlets, warned\r\nhim not to visit me again, and bade him farewell. Thereupon we went our\r\nseparate ways and I saw him no more. Whether he subsequently played a\r\nleading part in the movement I never could ascertain, because I did\r\nnot know his real name; but if the conception which I formed of his\r\ncharacter was at all accurate, he probably ended his career in Siberia,\r\nfor he was not a man to look back after having put his hand to the\r\nplough. That is a peculiar trait of the Russian revolutionists of the\r\nperiod in question. Their passion for realising an impossible ideal was\r\nincurable. Many of them were again and again arrested; and as soon as\r\nthey escaped or were liberated they almost invariably went back to their\r\nrevolutionary activity and worked energetically until they again fell\r\ninto the clutches of the police.\r\n\r\nFrom this digression into the sphere of personal reminiscences I return\r\nnow and take up again the thread of the narrative.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the propaganda and the agitation had failed, partly\r\nbecause the masses showed themselves indifferent or hostile, and partly\r\nbecause the Government adopted vigorous repressive measures. We have\r\nseen, too, how the leaders found themselves in face of a formidable\r\ndilemma; either they must abandon their schemes or they must attack\r\ntheir persecutors. The more energetic among them, as I have already\r\nstated, chose the latter alternative, and they proceeded at once to\r\ncarry out their policy. In the course of a single year (February, 1878,\r\nto February, 1879) a whole series of terrorist crimes was committed; in\r\nKief an attempt was made on the life of the Public Prosecutor, and an\r\nofficer of gendarmerie was stabbed; in St. Petersburg the Chief of the\r\nPolitical Police of the Empire (General Mezentsef) was assassinated in\r\nbroad daylight in one of the central streets, and a similar attempt\r\nwas made on his successor (General Drenteln); at Kharkof the Governor\r\n(Prince Krapotkin) was shot dead when entering his residence. During the\r\nsame period two members of the revolutionary organisation, accused of\r\ntreachery, were \"executed\" by order of local Committees. In most cases\r\nthe perpetrators of the crimes contrived to escape. One of them became\r\nwell known in Western Europe as an author under the pseudonym of\r\nStepniak.\r\n\r\nTerrorism had not the desired effect. On the contrary, it stimulated the\r\nzeal and activity of the authorities, and in the course of the winter of\r\n1878-79 hundreds of arrests--some say as many as 2,000--were made in\r\nSt. Petersburg alone. Driven to desperation, the revolutionists still\r\nat large decided that it was useless to assassinate mere officials; the\r\nfons et origo mali must be reached; a blow must be struck at the Tsar\r\nhimself! The first attempt was made by a young man called Solovyoff, who\r\nfired several shots at Alexander II. as he was walking near the Winter\r\nPalace, but none of them took effect.\r\n\r\nThis policy of aggressive terrorism did not meet with universal approval\r\namong the revolutionists, and it was determined to discuss the matter\r\nat a Congress of delegates from various local circles. The meetings were\r\nheld in June, 1879, two months after Solovyoff\u0027s unsuccessful attempt,\r\nat two provincial towns, Lipetsk and Voronezh. It was there agreed in\r\nprinciple to confirm the decision of the Terrorist Narodovoltsi. As the\r\nLiberals were not in a position to create liberal institutions or to\r\ngive guarantees for political rights, which are the essential conditions\r\nof any Socialist agitation, there remained for the revolutionary party\r\nno other course than to destroy the despotic autocracy. Thereupon a\r\nprogramme of action was prepared, and an Executive Committee elected.\r\nFrom that moment, though there were still many who preferred milder\r\nmethods, the Terrorists had the upper hand, and they at once proceeded\r\nto centralise the organisation and to introduce stricter discipline,\r\nwith greater precautions to ensure secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee imagined that by assassinating the Tsar\r\nautocracy might be destroyed, and several carefully planned attempts\r\nwere made. The first plan was to wreck the train when the Imperial\r\nfamily were returning to St. Petersburg from the Crimea. Mines were\r\naccordingly laid at three separate points, but they all failed. At the\r\nlast of the three points (near Moscow) a train was blown up, but it was\r\nnot the one in which the Imperial family was travelling.\r\n\r\nNot at all discouraged by this failure, nor by the discovery of its\r\nsecret printing-press by the police, the Executive Committee next tried\r\nto attain its object by an explosion of dynamite in the Winter Palace\r\nwhen the Imperial family were assembled at dinner. The execution was\r\nentrusted to a certain Halturin, one of the few revolutionists of\r\npeasant origin. As an exceptionally clever carpenter and polisher, he\r\neasily found regular employment in the palace, and he contrived to make\r\na rough plan of the building. This plan, on which the dining-hall was\r\nmarked with an ominous red cross, fell into the hands of the police, and\r\nthey made what they considered a careful investigation; but they failed\r\nto unravel the plot and did not discover the dynamite concealed in the\r\ncarpenters\u0027 sleeping quarters. Halturin showed wonderful coolness while\r\nthe search was going on, and continued to sleep every night on the\r\nexplosive, though it caused him excruciating headaches. When he was\r\nassured by the chemist of the Executive Committee that the quantity\r\ncollected was sufficient, he exploded the mine at the usual dinner hour,\r\nand contrived to escape uninjured.* In the guardroom immediately above\r\nthe spot where the dynamite was exploded ten soldiers were killed and 53\r\nwounded, and in the dining-hall the floor was wrecked, but the Imperial\r\nfamily escaped in consequence of not sitting down to dinner at the usual\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n     * After living some time in Roumania he returned to Russia\r\n     under the name of Stepanof, and in 1882 he was tried and\r\n     executed for complicity in the assassination of General\r\n     Strebnekof.\r\n\r\nFor this barbarous act the Executive Committee publicly accepted full\r\nresponsibility. In a proclamation placarded in the streets of St.\r\nPetersburg it declared that, while regretting the death of the soldiers,\r\nit was resolved to carry on the struggle with the Autocratic Power\r\nuntil the social reforms should be entrusted to a Constituent Assembly,\r\ncomposed of members freely elected and furnished with instructions from\r\ntheir constituents.\r\n\r\nFinding police-repression so ineffectual, Alexander II. determined to\r\ntry the effect of conciliation, and for this purpose he placed Loris\r\nMelikof at the head of the Government, with semi-dictatorial powers\r\n(February, 1880). The experiment did not succeed. By the Terrorists\r\nit was regarded as \"a hypocritical Liberalism outwardly and a veiled\r\nbrutality within,\" while in the official world it was condemned as an\r\nact of culpable weakness on the part of the autocracy. One consequence\r\nof it was that the Executive Committee was encouraged to continue its\r\nefforts, and, as the police became much less active, it was enabled\r\nto improve the revolutionary organisation. In a circular sent to the\r\naffiliated provincial associations it explained that the only source\r\nof legislation must be the national will,* and as the Government would\r\nnever accept such a principle, its hand must be forced by a great\r\npopular insurrection, for which all available forces should be\r\norganised. The peasantry, as experience had shown, could not yet be\r\nrelied on, but efforts should be made to enrol the workmen of the towns.\r\nGreat importance was attached to propaganda in the army; but as few\r\nconversions had been made among the rank and file, attention was to\r\nbe directed chiefly to the officers, who would be able to carry their\r\nsubordinates with them at the critical moment.\r\n\r\n     * Hence the designation Narodovoltsi (which, as we have\r\n     seen, means literally National-will-ists) adopted by this\r\n     section.\r\n\r\nWhile thus recommending the scheme of destroying autocracy by means of\r\na popular insurrection in the distant future, the Committee had not\r\nabandoned more expeditious methods, and it was at that moment hatching\r\na plot for the assassination of the Tsar. During the winter months his\r\nMajesty was in the habit of holding on Sundays a small parade in the\r\nriding-school near the Michael Square in St. Petersburg. On Sunday,\r\nMarch 3d, 1881, the streets by which he usually returned to the Palace\r\nhad been undermined at two places, and on an alternative route several\r\nconspirators were posted with hand-grenades concealed under their great\r\ncoats. The Emperor chose the alternative route. Here, at a signal given\r\nby Sophia Perovski, the first grenade was thrown by a student called\r\nRyssakoff, but it merely wounded some members of the escort. The Emperor\r\nstopped and got out of his sledge, and as he was making inquiries about\r\nthe wounded soldiers a second grenade was thrown by a youth called\r\nGrinevitski, with fatal effect. Alexander II. was conveyed hurriedly to\r\nthe Winter Palace, and died almost immediately.\r\n\r\nBy this act the members of the Executive Committee proved their energy\r\nand their talent as conspirators, but they at the same time showed their\r\nshortsightedness and their political incapacity; for they had made no\r\npreparations for immediately seizing the power which they so ardently\r\ncoveted--with the intention of using it, of course, entirely for the\r\npublic good. If the facts were not so well authenticated, we might\r\ndismiss the whole story as incredible. A group of young people,\r\ncertainly not more than thirty or forty in number, without any organised\r\nmaterial force behind them, without any influential accomplices in the\r\narmy or the official world, without any prospect of support from the\r\nmasses, and with no plan for immediate action after the assassination,\r\ndeliberately provoked the crisis for which they were so hopelessly\r\nunprepared. It has been suggested that they expected the Liberals\r\nto seize the Supreme Power, but this explanation is evidently an\r\nafterthought, because they knew that the Liberals were as unprepared\r\nas themselves and they regarded them at that time as dangerous\r\nrivals. Besides this, the explanation is quite irreconcilable with the\r\nproclamation issued by the Executive Committee immediately afterwards.\r\nThe most charitable way of explaining the conduct of the conspirators is\r\nto suppose that they were actuated more by blind hatred of the autocracy\r\nand its agents than by political calculations of a practical kind--that\r\nthey acted simply like a wounded bull in the arena, which shuts its eyes\r\nand recklessly charges its tormentors.\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Emperor had not at all the effect which the\r\nNarodovoltsi anticipated. On the contrary, it destroyed their hopes of\r\nsuccess. Many people of liberal convictions who sympathised vaguely with\r\nthe revolutionary movement without taking part in it, and who did not\r\ncondemn very severely the attacks on police officials, were horrified\r\nwhen they found that the would-be reformers did not spare even the\r\nsacred person of the Tsar. At the same time, the police officials, who\r\nhad become lax and inefficient under the conciliatory regime of Loris\r\nMelikof, recovered their old zeal, and displayed such inordinate\r\nactivity that the revolutionary organisation was paralysed and in great\r\nmeasure destroyed. Six of the regicides were condemned to death, and\r\nfive of them publicly executed, amongst the latter Sophia Perovski,\r\none of the most active and personally sympathetic personages among the\r\nrevolutionists. Scores of those who had taken an active part in the\r\nmovement were in prison or in exile. For a short time the propaganda\r\nwas continued among military and naval officers, and various attempts\r\nat reorganisation, especially in the southern provinces, were made, but\r\nthey all failed. A certain Degaief, who had taken part in the formation\r\nof military circles, turned informer, and aided the police. By his\r\ntreachery not only a considerable number of officers, but also Vera\r\nFilipof, a young lady of remarkable ability and courage, who was the\r\nleading spirit in the attempts at reorganisation, were arrested. There\r\nwere still a number of leaders living abroad, and from time to time they\r\nsent emissaries to revive the propaganda, but these efforts were all\r\nfruitless. One of the active members of the revolutionary party, Leo\r\nDeutsch, who has since published his Memoirs, relates how the tide of\r\nrevolution ebbed rapidly at this time. \"Both in Russia and abroad,\"\r\nhe says, \"I had seen how the earlier enthusiasm had given way to\r\nscepticism; men had lost faith, though many of them would not allow\r\nthat it was so. It was clear to me that a reaction had set in for\r\nmany years.\" Of the attempts to resuscitate the movement he says: \"The\r\nuntried and unskilfully managed societies were run to death before they\r\ncould undertake anything definite, and the unity and interdependence\r\nwhich characterised the original band of members had disappeared.\" With\r\nregard to the want of unity, another prominent revolutionist (Maslof)\r\nwrote to a friend (Dragomanof) at Geneva in 1882 in terms of bitter\r\ncomplaint. He accused the Executive Committee of trying to play the\r\npart of chief of the whole revolutionary party, and declared that its\r\ncentralising tendencies were more despotic than those of the Government.\r\nDistributing orders among its adherents without initiating them into\r\nits plans, it insisted on unquestioning obedience. The Socialist youth,\r\nardent adherents of Federalism, were indignant at this treatment, and\r\nbegan to understand that the Committee used them simply as chair a\r\ncanon. The writer described in vivid colours the mutual hostility which\r\nreigned among various fractions of the party, and which manifested\r\nitself in accusations and even in denunciations; and he predicted that\r\nthe Narodnaya Volya, which had organised the various acts of terrorism\r\nculminating in the assassination of the Emperor, would never develop\r\ninto a powerful revolutionary party. It had sunk into the slough of\r\nuntruth, and it could only continue to deceive the Government and the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIn the mutual recriminations several interesting admissions were made.\r\nIt was recognised that neither the educated classes nor the common\r\npeople were capable of bringing about a revolution: the former were not\r\nnumerous enough, and the latter were devoted to the Tsar and did not\r\nsympathise with the revolutionary movement, though they might perhaps\r\nbe induced to rise at a moment of crisis. It was considered doubtful\r\nwhether such a rising was desirable, because the masses, being\r\ninsufficiently prepared, might turn against the educated minority. In no\r\ncase could a popular insurrection attain the object which the Socialists\r\nhad in view, because the power would either remain in the hands of the\r\nTsar--thanks to the devotion of the common people--or it would fall into\r\nthe hands of the Liberals, who would oppress the masses worse than the\r\nautocratic Government had done. Further, it was recognised that acts of\r\nterrorism were worse than useless, because they were misunderstood by\r\nthe ignorant, and tended to inflame the masses against the leaders.\r\nIt seemed necessary, therefore, to return to a pacific propaganda.\r\nTikhomirof, who was nominally directing the movement from abroad, became\r\nutterly discouraged, and wrote in 1884 to one of his emissaries in\r\nRussia (Lopatin): \"You now see Russia, and can convince yourself that it\r\ndoes not possess the material for a vast work of reorganisation. . . .\r\nI advise you seriously not to make superhuman efforts and not to make\r\na scandal in attempting the impossible. . . . If you do not want to\r\nsatisfy yourself with trifles, come away and await better times.\"\r\n\r\nIn examining the material relating to this period one sees clearly that\r\nthe revolutionary movement had got into a vicious circle. As pacific\r\npropaganda had become impossible, in consequence of the opposition of\r\nthe authorities and the vigilance of the police, the Government could be\r\noverturned only by a general insurrection; but the general insurrection\r\ncould not be prepared without pacific propaganda. As for terrorism, it\r\nhad become discredited. Tikhomirof himself came to the conclusion that\r\nthe terrorist idea was altogether a mistake, not only morally, but also\r\nfrom the point of view of political expediency. A party, he explained,\r\nhas either the force to overthrow the Government, or it has not; in the\r\nformer case it has no need of political assassination, and in the latter\r\nthe assassinations have no effect, because Governments are not so stupid\r\nas to let themselves be frightened by those who cannot overthrow them.\r\nPlainly there was nothing to be done but to wait for better times, as he\r\nhad suggested, and the better times did not seem to be within measurable\r\ndistance. He himself, after publishing a brochure entitled \"Why I Ceased\r\nto Be a Revolutionist,\" made his peace with the Government, and others\r\nfollowed his example.* In one prison nine made formal recantations,\r\namong them Emilianof, who held a reserve bomb ready when Alexander II.\r\nwas assassinated. Occasional acts of terrorism showed that there was\r\nstill fire under the smouldering embers, but they were few and far\r\nbetween. The last serious incident of the kind during this period was\r\nthe regicide conspiracy of Sheviryoff in March, 1887. The conspirators,\r\ncarrying the bombs, were arrested in the principal street of St.\r\nPetersburg, and five of them were hanged. The railway accident of Borki,\r\nwhich happened in the following year, and in which the Imperial family\r\nhad a very narrow escape, ought perhaps to be added to the list, because\r\nthere is reason to believe that it was the work of revolutionists.\r\n\r\n     * Tikhomirof subsequently worked against the Social\r\n     Democrats in Moscow in the interests of the Government.\r\n\r\nBy this time all the cooler heads among the revolutionists, especially\r\nthose who were living abroad in personal safety, had come to understand\r\nthat the Socialist ideal could not be attained by popular insurrection,\r\nterrorism, or conspiracies, and consequently that further activity\r\non the old lines was absurd. Those of them who did not abandon the\r\nenterprise in despair reverted to the idea that Autocratic Power,\r\nimpregnable against frontal attacks, might be destroyed by prolonged\r\nsiege operations. This change of tactics is reflected in the\r\nrevolutionary literature. In 1889, for example, the editor of the\r\nSvobodnaya Rossia declared that the aim of the movement now\r\nwas political freedom--not only as a stepping-stone to social\r\nreorganisation, but as a good in itself. This is, he explains, the only\r\npossible revolution at present in Russia. \"For the moment there can be\r\nno other immediate practical aim. Ulterior aims are not abandoned, but\r\nthey are not at present within reach. . . The revolutionists of the\r\nseventies and the eighties did not succeed in creating among the\r\npeasantry or the town workmen anything which had even the appearance\r\nof a force capable of struggling with the Government; and the\r\nrevolutionists of the future will have no greater success until they\r\nhave obtained such political rights as personal inviolability. Our\r\nimmediate aim, therefore, is a National Assembly controlled by local\r\nself-government, and this can be brought about only by a union of all\r\nthe revolutionary forces.\"\r\n\r\nThere were still indications, it is true, that the old spirit of\r\nterrorism was not yet quite extinct: Captain Zolotykhin, for example,\r\nan officer of the Moscow secret police, was assassinated by a female\r\nrevolutionist in 1890. But such incidents were merely the last fitful\r\nsputterings of a lamp that was going out for want of oil. In 1892\r\nStepniak declared it evident to all that the professional revolutionists\r\ncould not alone overthrow autocracy, however great their energy and\r\nheroism; and he arrived at the same conclusion as the writer just\r\nquoted. Of course, immediate success was not to be expected. \"It is only\r\nfrom the evolutionist\u0027s point of view that the struggle with autocracy\r\nhas a meaning. From any other standpoint it must seem a sanguinary\r\nfarce--a mere exercise in the art of self-sacrifice!\" Such are the\r\nconclusions arrived at in 1892 by a man who had been in 1878 one of the\r\nleading terrorists, and who had with his own hand assassinated General\r\nMezentsef, Chief of the Political Police.\r\n\r\nThus the revolutionary movement, after passing through four stages,\r\nwhich I may call the academic, the propagandist, the insurrectionary,\r\nand the terrorist, had failed to accomplish its object. One of those\r\nwho had taken an active part in it, and who, after spending two years\r\nin Siberia as a political exile, escaped and settled in Western Europe,\r\ncould write thus: \"Our revolutionary movement is dead, and we who are\r\nstill alive stand by the grave of our beautiful departed and discuss\r\nwhat is wanting to her. One of us thinks that her nose should be\r\nimproved; another suggests a change in her chin or her hair. We do not\r\nnotice the essential that what our beautiful departed wants is life;\r\nthat it is not a matter of hair or eyebrows, but of a living soul, which\r\nformerly concealed all defects, and made her beautiful, and which now\r\nhas flown away. However we may invent changes and improvements, all\r\nthese things are utterly insignificant in comparison with what is really\r\nwanting, and what we cannot give; for who can breathe a living soul into\r\na corpse?\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, the movement which I have endeavoured to describe was at an\r\nend; but another movement, having the same ultimate object, was coming\r\ninto existence, and it constitutes one of the essential factors of\r\nthe present situation. Some of the exiles in Switzerland and Paris had\r\nbecome acquainted with the social-democratic and labour movements in\r\nWestern Europe, and they believed that the strategy and tactics employed\r\nin these movements might be adopted in Russia. How far they have\r\nsucceeded in carrying out this policy I shall relate presently; but\r\nbefore entering on this subject, I must explain how the application\r\nof such a policy had been rendered possible by changes in the economic\r\nconditions. Russia had begun to create rapidly a great manufacturing\r\nindustry and an industrial proletariat. This will form the subject of\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL PROGRESS AND THE PROLETARIAT\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia till Lately a Peasant Empire--Early Efforts to Introduce Arts and\r\nCrafts--Peter the Great and His Successors--Manufacturing Industry\r\nLong Remains an Exotic--The Cotton Industry--The Reforms of Alexander\r\nII.--Protectionists and Free Trade--Progress under High Tariffs--M.\r\nWitte\u0027s Policy--How Capital Was Obtained--Increase of Exports--Foreign\r\nFirms Cross the Customs Frontier--Rapid Development of Iron Industry--A\r\nCommercial Crisis--M.

Witte--The Industrial Proletariat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago Russia was still essentially a peasant empire, living by\r\nagriculture of a primitive type, and supplying her other wants chiefly\r\nby home industries, as was the custom in Western Europe during the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\nFor many generations her rulers had been trying to transplant into their\r\nwide dominions the art and crafts of the West, but they had formidable\r\ndifficulties to contend with, and their success was not nearly as great\r\nas they desired. We know that as far back as the fourteenth century\r\nthere were cloth-workers in Moscow, for we read in the chronicles that\r\nthe workshops of these artisans were sacked when the town was stormed\r\nby the Tartars. Workers in metal had also appeared in some of the larger\r\ntowns by that time, but they do not seem to have risen much above the\r\nlevel of ordinary blacksmiths. They were destined, however, to make more\r\nrapid progress than other classes of artisans, because the old Tsars of\r\nMuscovy, like other semi-barbarous potentates, admired and envied the\r\nindustries of more civilised countries mainly from the military point\r\nof view. What they wanted most was a plentiful supply of good arms\r\nwherewith to defend themselves and attack their neighbours, and it was\r\nto this object that their most strenuous efforts were directed.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1475 Ivan III., the grandfather of Ivan the Terrible, sent a\r\ndelegate to Venice to seek out for him an architect who, in addition to\r\nhis own craft, knew how to make guns; and in due course appeared in\r\nthe Kremlin a certain Muroli, called Aristotle by his contemporaries on\r\naccount of his profound learning. He undertook \"to build churches and\r\npalaces, to cast big bells and cannons, to fire off the said cannons,\r\nand to make every sort of castings very cunningly\"; and for the exercise\r\nof these various arts it was solemnly stipulated in a formal document\r\nthat he should receive the modest salary of ten roubles monthly. With\r\nregard to the military products, at least, the Venetian faithfully\r\nfulfilled his contract, and in a short time the Tsar had the\r\nsatisfaction of possessing a \"cannon-house,\" subsequently dignified with\r\nthe name of \"arsenal.\" Some of the natives learned the foreign art, and\r\nexactly a century later (1856) a Russian, or at least a Slav, called\r\nTchekhof, produced a famous \"Tsar-cannon,\" weighing as much as 96,000\r\nlbs. The connection thus established with the mechanical arts of the\r\nWest was always afterwards maintained, and we find frequent notices of\r\nthe fact in contemporary writers. In the reign of the grandfather of\r\nPeter the Great, for example, two paper-works were established by an\r\nItalian; and velvet for the Tsar and his Boyars, gold brocades for\r\necclesiastical vestments, and rude kinds of glass for ordinary purposes\r\nwere manufactured under the august patronage of the enlightened ruler.\r\nHis son Alexis went a good many steps further, and scandalised\r\nhis God-fearing orthodox subjects by his love of foreign heretical\r\ninventions. It was in his German suburb of Moscow that young Peter,\r\nwho was to be crowned \"the Great,\" made his first acquaintance with the\r\nuseful arts of the West.\r\n\r\nWhen the great reformer came to the throne he found in his Tsardom,\r\nbesides many workshops, some ten foundries, all of which were under\r\norders \"to cast cannons, bombs, and bullets, and to make arms for the\r\nservice of the State.\" This seemed to him only a beginning, especially\r\nfor the mining and iron industry, in which he was particularly\r\ninterested. By importing foreign artificers and placing at their\r\ndisposal big estates, with numerous serfs, in the districts where\r\nminerals were plentiful, and by carefully stipulating that these\r\nforeigners should teach his subjects well, and conceal from them none of\r\nthe secrets of the craft, he created in the Ural a great iron industry,\r\nwhich still exists at the present day. Finding by experience that State\r\nmines and State ironworks were a heavy drain on his insufficiently\r\nreplenished treasury, he transferred some of them to private persons,\r\nand this policy was followed occasionally by his successors. Hence the\r\ngigantic fortunes of the Demidofs and other families. The Shuvalovs, for\r\nexample, in 1760 possessed, for the purpose of working their mines and\r\nironworks, no less than 33,000 serfs and a corresponding amount of land.\r\nUnfortunately the concessions were generally given not to enterprising\r\nbusiness-men, but to influential court-dignitaries, who confined their\r\nattention to squandering the revenues, and not a few of the mines and\r\nworks reverted to the Government.\r\n\r\nThe army required not only arms and ammunition, but also uniforms and\r\nblankets. Great attention, therefore, was paid to the woollen industry\r\nfrom the reign of Peter downwards. In the time of Catherine there\r\nwere already 120 cloth factories, but they were on a very small scale,\r\naccording to modern conceptions. Ten factories in Moscow, for example,\r\nhad amongst them only 104 looms, 130 workers, and a yearly output for\r\n200,000 roubles.\r\n\r\nWhile thus largely influenced in its economic policy by military\r\nconsiderations, the Government did not entirely neglect other branches\r\nof manufacturing industry. Ever since Russia had pretensions to being\r\na civilised power its rulers have always been inclined to pay more\r\nattention to the ornamental than the useful--to the varnish rather than\r\nthe framework of civilisation--and we need not therefore be surprised\r\nto find that long before the native industry could supply the materials\r\nrequired for the ordinary wants of humble life, attempts were made to\r\nproduce such things as Gobelin tapestries. I mention this merely as an\r\nillustration of a characteristic trait of the national character,\r\nthe influence of which may be found in many other spheres of official\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIf Russia did not attain the industrial level of Western Europe, it was\r\nnot from want of ambition and effort on the part of the rulers. They\r\nworked hard, if not always wisely, for this end. Manufacturers were\r\nexempted from rates and taxes, and even from military service, and some\r\nof them, as I have said, received large estates from the Crown on the\r\nunderstanding that the serfs should be employed as workmen. At the\r\nsame time they were protected from foreign competition by prohibitive\r\ntariffs. In a word, the manufacturing industry was nursed and fostered\r\nin a way to satisfy the most thorough-going protectionist, especially\r\nthose branches which worked up native raw material such as ores, flax,\r\nhemp, wool, and tallow. Occasionally the official interference and\r\nanxiety to protect public interests went further than the manufacturers\r\ndesired. On more than one occasion the authorities fixed the price\r\nof certain kinds of manufactured goods, and in 1754 the Senate, being\r\nanxious to protect the population from fires, ordered all glass and iron\r\nworks within a radius of 200 versts around Moscow to be destroyed! In\r\nspite of such obstacles, the manufacturing industry as a whole\r\nmade considerable progress. Between 1729 and 1762 the number of\r\nestablishments officially recognised as factories rose from 26 to 335.\r\n\r\nThese results did not satisfy Catherine II., who ascended the throne in\r\n1762. Under the influence of her friends, the French Encyclopedistes,\r\nshe imagined for a time that the official control might be relaxed, and\r\nthat the system of employing serfs in the factories and foundries might\r\nbe replaced by free labour, as in Western Europe; monopolies might be\r\nabolished, and all liege subjects, including the peasants, might be\r\nallowed to embark in industrial undertakings as they pleased, \"for\r\nthe benefit of the State and the nation.\" All this looked very well on\r\npaper, but Catherine never allowed her sentimental liberalism to injure\r\nseriously the interests of her Empire, and she accordingly refrained\r\nfrom putting the laissez-faire principle largely into practice. Though\r\na good deal has been written about her economic policy, it is hardly\r\ndistinguishable from that of her predecessors. Like them, she maintained\r\nhigh tariffs, accorded large subsidies, and even prevented the export of\r\nraw material, in the hope that it might be worked up at home; and when\r\nthe prices in the woollen market rose very high, she compelled the\r\nmanufacturers to supply the army with cloth at a price fixed by the\r\nauthorities. In short, the old system remained practically unimpaired,\r\nand notwithstanding the steady progress made during the reign of\r\nNicholas I. (1825-55), when the number of factory hands rose from\r\n210,000 to 380,000, the manufacturing industry as a whole continued to\r\nbe, until the serfs were emancipated in 1861, a hothouse plant which\r\ncould flourish only in an officially heated atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere was one branch of it, however, to which this remark does not\r\napply. The art of cotton-spinning and cotton-weaving struck deep root\r\nin Russian soil. After remaining for generations in the condition of\r\na cottage industry--the yarn being distributed among the peasants\r\nand worked up by them in their own homes--it began, about 1825, to be\r\nmodernised. Though it still required to be protected against foreign\r\ncompetition, it rapidly outgrew the necessity for direct official\r\nsupport. Big factories driven by steam-power were constructed, the\r\nnumber of hands employed rose to 110,000, and the foundations of great\r\nfortunes were laid. Strange to say, many of the future millionaires were\r\nuneducated serfs. Sava Morozof, for example, who was to become one of\r\nthe industrial magnates of Moscow, was a serf belonging to a proprietor\r\ncalled Ryumin; most of the others were serfs of Count Sheremetyef--the\r\nowner of a large estate on which the industrial town of Ivanovo had\r\nsprung up--who was proud of having millionaires among his serfs, and who\r\nnever abused his authority over them. The great movement, however, was\r\nnot effected without the assistance of foreigners. Foreign foremen were\r\nlargely employed, and in the work of organisation a leading part was\r\nplayed by a German called Ludwig Knoop. Beginning life as a commercial\r\ntraveller for an English firm, he soon became a large cotton importer,\r\nand when in 1840 a feverish activity was produced in the Russian\r\nmanufacturing world by the Government\u0027s permission to import English\r\nmachines, his firm supplied these machines to the factories on condition\r\nof obtaining a share in the business. It has been calculated that it\r\nobtained in this way a share in no less than 122 factories, and hence\r\narose among the peasantry a popular saying:\r\n\r\n     \"Where there is a church, there you find a pope,\r\n     And where there is a factory, there you find a Knoop.\"*\r\n\r\nThe biggest creation of the firm was a factory built at Narva in 1856,\r\nwith nearly half a million spindles driven by water-power.\r\n\r\n     * Gdye tserkov--tam pop;\r\n     A gdye fabrika--tam Knop.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of last century a revolution was brought about in the\r\nmanufacturing industry generally by the emancipation of the serfs,\r\nthe rapid extension of railways, the facilities for creating limited\r\nliability companies, and by certain innovations in the financial policy\r\nof the Government. The emancipation put on the market an unlimited\r\nsupply of cheap labour; the construction of railways in all directions\r\nincreased a hundredfold the means of communication; and the new banks\r\nand other credit institutions, aided by an overwhelming influx of\r\nforeign capital, encouraged the foundation and extension of industrial\r\nand commercial enterprise of every description. For a time there was\r\ngreat excitement. It was commonly supposed that in all matters relating\r\nto trade and industry Russia had suddenly jumped up to the level of\r\nWestern Europe, and many people in St. Petersburg, carried away by the\r\nprevailing enthusiasm for liberalism in general and the doctrines of\r\nFree Trade in particular, were in favour of abolishing protectionism\r\nas an antiquated restriction on liberty and an obstacle to economic\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAt one moment the Government was disposed to yield to the current, but\r\nit was restrained by an influential group of conservative Political\r\nEconomists, who appealed to patriotic sentiment, and by the Moscow\r\nmanufacturers, who declared that Free Trade would ruin the country.\r\nAfter a little hesitation it proceeded to raise, instead of lowering,\r\nthe protectionist tariff. In 1869-76 the ad valorem duties were, on an\r\naverage, under thirteen per cent., but from that time onwards they rose\r\nsteadily, until the last five years of the century, when they averaged\r\nthirty-three per cent., and were for some articles very much higher.\r\nIn this way the Moscow industrial magnates were protected against the\r\ninflux of cheap foreign goods, but they were not saved from foreign\r\ncompetition, for many foreign manufacturers, in order to enjoy the\r\nbenefit of the high duties, founded factories in Russia. Even the firmly\r\nestablished cotton industry suffered from these intruders. Industrial\r\nsuburbs containing not a few cotton factories sprang up around St.\r\nPetersburg; and a small Polish village called Lodz, near the German\r\nfrontier, grew rapidly into a prosperous town of 300,000 inhabitants,\r\nand became a serious rival to the ancient Muscovite capital. So\r\nseverely was the competition of this young upstart felt, that the Moscow\r\nmerchants petitioned the Emperor to protect them by drawing a customs\r\nfrontier round the Polish provinces, but their petition was not granted.\r\n\r\nUnder the shelter of the high tariffs the manufacturing industry as a\r\nwhole has made rapid progress, and the cotton trade has kept well to\r\nthe front. In that branch, between 1861 and 1897, the number of hands\r\nemployed rose from 120,000 to 325,000, and the estimated value of the\r\nproducts from 72 to 478 millions of roubles. In 1899 the number of\r\nspindles was considerably over six millions, and the number of automatic\r\nweaving machines 145,000.\r\n\r\nThe iron industry has likewise progressed rapidly, though it has not yet\r\noutgrown the necessity for Government support, and it is not yet able to\r\nprovide for all home wants. About forty years ago it received a powerful\r\nimpulse from the discovery that in the provinces to the north of the\r\nCrimea and the Sea of Azof there were enormous quantities of iron ore\r\nand beds of good coal in close proximity to each other. Thanks to this\r\ndiscovery and to other facts of which I shall have occasion to speak\r\npresently, this district, which had previously been agricultural and\r\npastoral, has outstripped the famous Ural region, and has become the\r\nBlack Country of Russia. The vast lonely steppe, where formerly one saw\r\nmerely the peasant-farmer, the shepherd, and the Tchumak,* driving along\r\nsomnolently with his big, long-horned, white bullocks, is now dotted\r\nover with busy industrial settlements of mushroom growth, and great\r\nironworks--some of them unfinished; while at night the landscape is lit\r\nup with the lurid flames of gigantic blast-furnaces. In this wonderful\r\ntransformation, as in the history of Russian industrial progress\r\ngenerally, a great part was played by foreigners. The pioneer who did\r\nmost in this district was an Englishman, John Hughes, who began life\r\nas the son and pupil of a Welsh blacksmith, and whose sons are now\r\ndirectors of the biggest of the South Russian ironworks.\r\n\r\n     * The Tchumak, a familiar figure in the songs and legends of\r\n     Little Russia, was the carrier who before the construction\r\n     of railways transported the grain to the great markets, and\r\n     brought back merchandise to the interior.  He is gradually\r\n     disappearing.\r\n\r\nMuch as the South has progressed industrially in recent years, it still\r\nremains far behind those industrial portions of the country which were\r\nthickly settled at an earlier date. From this point of view the most\r\nimportant region is the group of provinces clustering round Moscow; next\r\ncomes the St. Petersburg region, including Livonia; and thirdly Poland.\r\nAs for the various kinds of industry, the most important category is\r\nthat of textile fabrics, the second that of articles of nutrition,\r\nand the third that of ores and metals. The total production, if we may\r\nbelieve certain statistical authorities, places Russia now among the\r\nindustrial nations of the world in the fifth place, immediately after\r\nthe United States, England, Germany, and France, and a little before\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nThe man who has in recent times carried out most energetically the\r\npolicy of protecting and fostering native industries is M. Witte, a name\r\nnow familiar to Western Europe. An avowed disciple of the great German\r\neconomist, Friedrich List, about whose works he published a brochure in\r\n1888, he held firmly, from his youth upwards, the doctrine that\r\n\"each nation should above all things develop harmoniously its natural\r\nresources to the highest possible degree of independence, protecting\r\nits own industries and preferring the national aim to the pecuniary\r\nadvantage of individuals.\" As a corollary to this principle he declared\r\nthat purely agricultural countries are economically backward and\r\nintellectually stagnant, being condemned to pay tribute to the nations\r\nwho have learned to work up their raw products into more valuable\r\ncommodities. The good old English doctrine that certain countries were\r\nintended by Providence to be eternally agricultural, and that their\r\nfunction in the economy of the universe is to supply raw material\r\nfor the industrial nations, was always in his eyes an abomination--an\r\ningenious, nefarious invention of the Manchester school, astutely\r\ninvented for the purpose of keeping the younger nations permanently in\r\na state of economic bondage for the benefit of English manufacturers. To\r\nemancipate Russia from this thraldom by enabling her to create a great\r\nnative industry, sufficient to supply all her own wants, was the aim of\r\nhis policy and the constant object of his untiring efforts. Those who\r\nhave had the good fortune to know him personally must have often\r\nheard him discourse eloquently on this theme, supporting his views by\r\nquotations from the economists of his own school, and by illustrations\r\ndrawn from the history of his own and other countries.\r\n\r\nA necessary condition of realising this aim was that there should be\r\nhigh tariffs. These already existed, and they might be raised\r\nstill higher, but in themselves they were not enough. For the rapid\r\ndevelopment of the native industry an enormous capital was required, and\r\nthe first problem to be solved was how this capital could be obtained.\r\nAt one moment the energetic minister conceived the project of creating a\r\nfictitious capital by inflating the paper currency; but this idea\r\nproved unpopular. When broached in the Council of State it encountered\r\ndetermined opposition. Some of the members of that body, especially M.\r\nBunge, who had been himself Minister of Finance, and who remembered\r\nthe evil effects of the inordinate inflation of the currency on foreign\r\nexchanges during the Turkish War, advocated strongly the directly\r\nopposite course--a return to gold monometallism, for which M.\r\nVishnegradski, M. Witte\u0027s immediate predecessor, had made considerable\r\npreparations. Being a practical man without inveterate prejudices, M.\r\nWitte gave up the scheme which he could not carry through, and adopted\r\nthe views of his opponents. He would introduce the gold currency as\r\nrecommended; but how was the requisite capital to be obtained? It must\r\nbe procured from abroad, somehow, and the simplest way seemed to be to\r\nstimulate the export of native products. For this purpose the railways\r\nwere extended,* the traffic rates manipulated, and the means of\r\ntransport improved generally.\r\n\r\n     * In 1892, when M. Witte undertook the financial\r\n     administration, there were 30,620 versts of railway, and at\r\n     the end of 1900 there were 51,288 versts.\r\n\r\nA certain influx of gold was thus secured, but not nearly enough for the\r\nobject in view.* Some more potent means, therefore, had to be employed,\r\nand the inventive minister evolved a new scheme. If he could only induce\r\nforeign capitalists to undertake manufacturing industries in Russia,\r\nthey would, at one and the same time, bring into the country the capital\r\nrequired, and they would cooperate powerfully in that development of the\r\nnational industry which he so ardently wished. No sooner had he roughly\r\nsketched out his plan--for he was not a man to let the grass grow under\r\nhis feet--than he set himself to put it into execution by letting it\r\nbe known in the financial world that the Government was ready to open\r\na great field for lucrative investments, in the form of profitable\r\nenterprises under the control of those who subscribed the capital.\r\n\r\n     * In 1891 the total value of the exports was roughly\r\n     70,000,000 pounds.  It then fell, in consequence of bad\r\n     harvests, to 45 millions, and did not recover the previous\r\n     maximum until 1897, when it stood at 73 millions.\r\n     Thereafter there was a steady rise till 1901, when the total\r\n     was estimated at 76 millions.\r\n\r\nForeign capitalists responded warmly to the call. Crowds of\r\nconcession-hunters, projectors, company promoters, et hoc genus omne,\r\ncollected in St. Petersburg, offering their services on the most\r\ntempting terms; and all of them who could make out a plausible case were\r\nwell received at the Ministry of Finance. It was there explained to them\r\nthat in many branches of industry, such as the manufacture of textile\r\nfabrics, there was little or no room for newcomers, but that in\r\nothers the prospects were most brilliant. Take, for example, the iron\r\nindustries of Southern Russia. The boundless mineral wealth of that\r\nregion was still almost intact, and the few works which had been there\r\nestablished were paying very large dividends. The works founded by John\r\nHughes, for example, had repeatedly divided considerably over twenty per\r\ncent., and there was little fear for the future, because the Government\r\nhad embarked on a great scheme of railway extension, requiring an\r\nunlimited amount of rails and rolling-stock. What better opening could\r\nbe desired? Certainly the opening seemed most attractive, and into it\r\nrushed the crowd of company promoters, followed by stock-jobbers and\r\nbrokers, playing lively pieces of what the Germans call Zukunftsmusik.\r\nAn unwary and confiding public, especially in Belgium and France,\r\nlistened to the enchanting strains of the financial syrens, and invested\r\nlargely. Quickly the number of completed ironworks in that region rose\r\nfrom nine to seventeen, and in the short space of three years the output\r\nof pig-iron was nearly doubled. In 1900 there were 44 blast furnaces in\r\nworking order, and ten more were in course of construction. And all this\r\ntime the Imperial revenue increased by leaps and bounds, so that the\r\nintroduction of the gold currency was effected without difficulty. M.\r\nWitte was declared to be the greatest minister of his time--a Russian\r\nColbert or Turgot, or perhaps the two rolled into one.\r\n\r\nThen came a change. Competition and over-production led naturally to a\r\nfall in prices, and at the same time the demand decreased, because the\r\nrailway-building activity of the Government slackened. Alarmed at this\r\nstate of things, the banks which had helped to start and foster the huge\r\nand costly enterprises contracted their credits. By the end of 1899 the\r\ndisenchantment was general and widespread. Some of the companies were\r\nso weighted by the preliminary financial obligations, and had conducted\r\ntheir affairs in such careless, reckless fashion, that they had soon\r\nto shut down their mines and close their works. Even solid undertakings\r\nsuffered. The shares of the Briansk works, for example, which had given\r\ndividends as high as 30 per cent., fell from 500 to 230. The Mamontof\r\ncompanies--supposed to be one of the strongest financial groups in the\r\ncountry--had to suspend payment, and numerous other failures occurred.\r\nNearly all the commercial banks, having directly participated in the\r\nindustrial concerns, were rudely shaken. M. Witte, who had been for a\r\ntime the idol of a certain section of the financial world, became very\r\nunpopular, and was accused of misleading the investing public. Among the\r\naccusations brought against him some at least could easily be refuted.\r\nHe may have made mistakes in his policy, and may have been himself\r\nover-sanguine, but surely, as he subsequently replied to his accusers,\r\nit was no part of his duty to warn company promoters and directors that\r\nthey should refrain from over-production, and that their enterprises\r\nmight not be as remunerative as they expected. As to whether there\r\nis any truth in the assertion that he held out prospects of larger\r\nGovernment orders than he actually gave, I cannot say. That he cut\r\ndown prices, and showed himself a hard man to deal with, there seems no\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nThe reader may naturally be inclined to jump to the conclusion that the\r\ncommercial crisis just referred to was the cause of M. Witte\u0027s fall.\r\nSuch a conclusion would be entirely erroneous. The crisis happened in\r\nthe winter of 1899-1900, and M. Witte remained Finance Minister until\r\nthe autumn of 1903. His fall was the result of causes of a totally\r\ndifferent kind, and these I propose now to explain, because the\r\nexplanation will throw light on certain very curious and characteristic\r\nconceptions at present current in the Russian educated classes.\r\n\r\nOf course there were certain causes of a purely personal kind, but\r\nI shall dismiss them in a very few words. I remember once asking\r\na well-informed friend of M. Witte\u0027s what he thought of him as an\r\nadministrator and a statesman. The friend replied: \"Imagine a negro of\r\nthe Gold Coast let loose in modern European civilisation!\" This reply,\r\nlike most epigrammatic remarks, is a piece of gross exaggeration, but\r\nit has a modicum of truth in it. In the eyes of well-trained Russian\r\nofficials M. Witte was a titanic, reckless character, capable at any\r\nmoment of playing the part of the bull in the china-shop. As a masterful\r\nperson, brusque in manner and incapable of brooking contradiction,\r\nhe had made for himself many enemies; and his restless, irrepressible\r\nenergy had led him to encroach on the provinces of all his colleagues.\r\nPossessing as he did the control of the purse, his interference could\r\nnot easily be resisted. The Ministers of Interior, War, Agriculture,\r\nPublic Works, Public Instruction, and Foreign Affairs had all occasion\r\nto complain of his incursions into their departments. In contrast to his\r\ncolleagues, he was not only extremely energetic, but he was ever\r\nready to assume an astounding amount of responsibility; and as he was\r\nsomething of an opportunist, he was perhaps not always quixotically\r\nscrupulous in the choice of expedients for attaining his ends.\r\n\r\nAltogether M. Witte was an inconvenient personage in an administration\r\nin which strong personality is regarded as entirely out of place, and in\r\nwhich personal initiative is supposed to reside exclusively in the Tsar.\r\nIn addition to all this he was a man who felt keenly, and when he was\r\nirritated he did not always keep the unruly member under strict\r\ncontrol. If I am correctly informed, it was some imprudent and not very\r\nrespectful remarks, repeated by a subordinate and transmitted by a Grand\r\nDuke to the Tsar, which were the immediate cause of his transfer from\r\nthe influential post of Minister of Finance to the ornamental position\r\nof President of the Council of Ministers; but that was merely the\r\nproverbial last straw that broke the camel\u0027s back. His position was\r\nalready undermined, and it is the undermining process which I wish to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nThe first to work for his overthrow were the Agrarian Conservatives.\r\nThey could not deny that, from the purely fiscal point of view, his\r\nadministration was a marvellous success; for he was rapidly doubling the\r\nrevenue, and he had succeeded in replacing the fluctuating depreciated\r\npaper currency by a gold coinage; but they maintained that he was\r\nkilling the goose that laid the golden eggs. Evidently the tax-paying\r\npower of the rural classes was being overstrained, for they were falling\r\nmore and more into arrears in the payment of their taxes, and their\r\nimpoverishment was yearly increasing. All their reserves had been\r\nexhausted, as was shown by the famines of 1891-92, when the Government\r\nhad to spend hundreds of millions to feed them. Whilst the land was\r\nlosing its fertility, those who had to live by it were increasing in\r\nnumbers at an alarming rate. Already in some districts one-fifth of the\r\npeasant households had no longer any land of their own, and of those\r\nwho still possessed land a large proportion had no longer the cattle and\r\nhorses necessary to till and manure their allotments. No doubt M.\r\nWitte was beginning to perceive his mistake, and had done something to\r\npalliate the evils by improving the system of collecting the taxes and\r\nabolishing the duty on passports, but such merely palliative remedies\r\ncould have little effect. While a few capitalists were amassing gigantic\r\nfortunes, the masses were slowly and surely advancing to the brink\r\nof starvation. The welfare of the agriculturists, who constitute\r\nnine-tenths of the whole population, was being ruthlessly sacrificed,\r\nand for what? For the creation of a manufacturing industry which rested\r\non an artificial, precarious basis, and which had already begun to\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\nSo far the Agrarians, who champion the interests of the agricultural\r\nclasses. Their views were confirmed and their arguments strengthened by\r\nan influential group of men whom I may call, for want of a better name,\r\nthe philosophers or doctrinaire interpreters of history, who have,\r\nstrange to say, more influence in Russia than in any other country.\r\n\r\nThe Russian educated classes desire that the nation should be wealthy\r\nand self-supporting, and they recognise that for this purpose a large\r\nmanufacturing industry is required; but they are reluctant to make the\r\nsacrifices necessary to attain the object in view, and they imagine\r\nthat, somehow or other, these sacrifices may be avoided. Sympathising\r\nwith this frame of mind, the doctrinaires explain that the rich and\r\nprosperous countries of Europe and America obtained their wealth and\r\nprosperity by so-called \"Capitalism\"--that is to say, by a peculiar\r\nsocial organisation in which the two main factors are a small body of\r\nrich capitalists and manufacturers and an enormous pauper proletariat\r\nliving from hand to mouth, at the mercy of the heartless employers of\r\nlabour. Russia has lately followed in the footsteps of those wealthy\r\ncountries, and if she continues to do so she will inevitably be saddled\r\nwith the same disastrous results--plutocracy, pauperism, unrestrained\r\ncompetition in all spheres of activity, and a greatly intensified\r\nstruggle for life, in which the weaker will necessarily go to the wall.*\r\n\r\n     * Free competition in all spheres of activity, leading to\r\n     social inequality, plutocracy, and pauperism, is the\r\n     favourite bugbear of Russian theorists; and who is not a\r\n     theorist in Russia?  The fact indicates the prevalence of\r\n     Socialist ideas in the educated classes.\r\n\r\nHappily there is, according to these theorists, a more excellent way,\r\nand Russia can adopt it if she only remains true to certain mysterious\r\nprinciples of her past historic development. Without attempting to\r\nexpound those mysterious principles, to which I have repeatedly referred\r\nin previous chapters, I may mention briefly that the traditional\r\npatriarchal institutions on which the theorists found their hopes of a\r\nhappy social future for their country are the rural Commune, the native\r\nhome-industries, and the peculiar co-operative institutions called\r\nArtels. How these remnants of a semi-patriarchal state of society are to\r\nbe practically developed in such a way as to withstand the competition\r\nof manufacturing industry organised on modern \"capitalist\" lines, no\r\none has hitherto been able to explain satisfactorily, but many people\r\nindulge in ingenious speculations on the subject, like children planning\r\nthe means of diverting with their little toy spades a formidable\r\ninundation. In my humble opinion, the whole theory is a delusion; but\r\nit is held firmly--I might almost say fanatically--by those who, in\r\nopposition to the indiscriminate admirers of West-European and American\r\ncivilisation, consider themselves genuine Russians and exceptionally\r\ngood patriots. M. Witte has never belonged to that class. He believes\r\nthat there is only one road to national prosperity--the road by which\r\nWestern Europe has travelled--and along this road he tried to drive his\r\ncountry as rapidly as possible. He threw himself, therefore, heart and\r\nsoul into what his opponents call \"Capitalism,\" by raising State loans,\r\norganising banks and other credit institutions, encouraging the creation\r\nand extension of big factories, which must inevitably destroy the home\r\nindustry, and even--horribile dictu!--undermining the rural Commune,\r\nand thereby adding to the ranks of the landless proletariat, in order to\r\nincrease the amount of cheap labour for the benefit of the capitalists.\r\n\r\nWith the arguments thus supplied by Agrarians and doctrinaires, quite\r\nhonest and well-meaning, according to their lights, it was easy to sap\r\nM. Witte\u0027s position. Among his opponents, the most formidable was the\r\nlate M. Plehve, Minister of Interior--a man of a totally different\r\nstamp. A few months before his tragic end I had a long and interesting\r\nconversation with him, and I came away deeply impressed. Having\r\nrepeatedly had conversations of a similar kind with M. Witte, I could\r\ncompare, or rather contrast, the two men. Both of them evidently\r\npossessed an exceptional amount of mental power and energy, but in the\r\none it was volcanic, and in the other it was concentrated and thoroughly\r\nunder control. In discussion, the one reminded me of the self-taught,\r\nslashing swordsman; the other of the dexterous fencer, carefully trained\r\nin the use of the foils, who never launches out beyond the point at\r\nwhich he can quickly recover himself. As to whether M. Plehve was\r\nanything more than a bold, energetic, clever official there may be\r\ndifferences of opinion, but he certainly could assume the airs of a\r\nprofound and polished statesman, capable of looking at things from a\r\nmuch higher point of view than the ordinary tchinovnik, and he had the\r\ntalent of tacitly suggesting that a great deal of genuine, enlightened\r\nstatesmanship lay hidden under the smooth surface of his cautious\r\nreserve. Once or twice I could perceive that when criticising the\r\npresent state of things he had his volcanic colleague in his mind\u0027s eye;\r\nbut the covert allusions were so vague and so carefully worded that the\r\nsaid colleague, if he had been present, would hardly have been justified\r\nin entering a personal protest. A statesman of the higher type, I was\r\nmade to feel, should deal not with personalities, but with things, and\r\nit would be altogether unbecoming to complain of a colleague in presence\r\nof an outsider. Thus his attitude towards his opponent was most correct,\r\nbut it was not difficult to infer that he had little sympathy with the\r\npolicy of the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nFrom other sources I learned the cause of this want of sympathy. Being\r\nMinister of Interior, and having served long in the Police Department,\r\nM. Plehve considered that his first duty was the maintenance of public\r\norder and the protection of the person and autocracy of his august\r\nmaster. He was therefore the determined enemy of revolutionary\r\ntendencies, in whatever garb or disguise they might appear; and as\r\na statesman he had to direct his attention to everything likely to\r\nincrease those tendencies in the future. Now it seemed that in the\r\nfinancial policy which had been followed for some years there were\r\ngerms of future revolutionary fermentation. The peasantry were becoming\r\nimpoverished, and were therefore more likely to listen to the insidious\r\nsuggestions of Socialist agitators; and already agrarian disturbances\r\nhad occurred in the provinces of Kharkof and Poltava. The industrial\r\nproletariat which was being rapidly created was being secretly organised\r\nby the revolutionary Social Democrats, and already there had been\r\nserious labour troubles in some of the large towns. For any future\r\nrevolutionary movement the proletariat would naturally supply recruits.\r\nThen, at the other end of the social scale, a class of rich capitalists\r\nwas being created, and everybody who has read a little history knows\r\nthat a rich and powerful tiers etat cannot be permanently conciliated\r\nwith autocracy. Though himself neither an agrarian nor a Slavophil\r\ndoctrinaire, M. Plehve could not but have a certain sympathy with those\r\nwho were forging thunderbolts for the official annihilation of M. Witte.\r\nHe was too practical a man to imagine that the hands on the dial of\r\neconomic progress could be set back and a return made to moribund\r\npatriarchal institutions; but he thought that at least the pace might\r\nbe moderated. The Minister of Finance need not be in such a desperate,\r\nreckless hurry, and it was desirable to create conservative forces which\r\nmight counteract the revolutionary forces which his impulsive colleague\r\nwas inadvertently calling into existence.\r\n\r\nSome of the forgers of thunderbolts went a great deal further,\r\nand asserted or insinuated that M. Witte was himself consciously a\r\nrevolutionist, with secret, malevolent intentions. In support of their\r\ninsinuations they cited certain cases in which well-known Socialists had\r\nbeen appointed professors in academies under the control of the Ministry\r\nof Finance, and they pointed to the Peasant Bank, which enjoyed M.\r\nWitte\u0027s special protection. At first it had been supposed that the bank\r\nwould have an anti-revolutionary influence by preventing the\r\nformation of a landless proletariat and increasing the number of small\r\nland-owners, who are always and everywhere conservative so far as the\r\nrights of private property are concerned.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately its success roused the fears of the more conservative\r\nsection of the landed proprietors. These gentlemen, as I have already\r\nmentioned, pointed out that the estates of the nobles were rapidly\r\npassing into the hands of the peasantry, and that if this process were\r\nallowed to continue the hereditary Noblesse, which had always been the\r\ncivilising element in the rural population, and the surest support of\r\nthe throne, would drift into the towns and there sink into poverty or\r\namalgamate with the commercial plutocracy, and help to form a tiers etat\r\nwhich would be hostile to the Autocratic Power.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it was evident that the headstrong Minister\r\nof Finance could maintain his position only so long as he enjoyed the\r\nenergetic support of the Emperor, and this support, for reasons which I\r\nhave indicated above, failed him at the critical moment. When his\r\nwork was still unfinished he was suddenly compelled, by the Emperor\u0027s\r\ncommand, to relinquish his post and accept a position in which, it was\r\nsupposed, he would cease to have any influence in the administration.\r\n\r\nThus fell the Russian Colbert-Turgot, or whatever else he may be\r\ncalled. Whether financial difficulties in the future will lead to his\r\nreinstatement as Minister of Finance remains to be seen; but in any case\r\nhis work cannot be undone. He has increased manufacturing industry to\r\nan unprecedented extent, and, as M. Plehve perceived, the industrial\r\nproletariat which manufacturing industry on capitalist lines always\r\ncreates has provided a new field of activity for the revolutionists.\r\nI return, therefore, to the evolution of the revolutionary movement in\r\norder to describe its present phase, the first-fruits of which have\r\nbeen revealed in the labour disturbances in St. Petersburg and other\r\nindustrial centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN ITS LATEST PHASE\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence of Capitalism and Proletariat on the Revolutionary\r\nMovement--What is to be Done?--Reply of Plekhanof--A New Departure--Karl\r\nMarx\u0027s Theories Applied to Russia--Beginnings of a Social Democratic\r\nMovement--The Labour Troubles of 1894-96 in St. Petersburg--The Social\r\nDemocrats\u0027 Plan of Campaign--Schism in the Party--Trade-unionism and\r\nPolitical Agitation--The Labour Troubles of 1902--How the Revolutionary\r\nGroups are Differentiated from Each Other--Social Democracy and\r\nConstitutionalism--Terrorism--The Socialist Revolutionaries--The\r\nMilitant Organisation--Attitude of the Government--Factory\r\nLegislation--Government\u0027s Scheme for Undermining Social\r\nDemocracy--Father Gapon and His Labour Association--The Great Strike in\r\nSt. Petersburg--Father Gapon goes over to the Revolutionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of manufacturing industry on capitalist lines, and the\r\nconsequent formation of a large industrial proletariat, produced great\r\ndisappointment in all the theorising sections of the educated classes.\r\nThe thousands of men and women who had, since the accession of the\r\nTsar-Emancipator in 1855, taken a keen, enthusiastic interest in the\r\nprogress of their native country, all had believed firmly that in\r\nsome way or other Russia would escape \"the festering sores of Western\r\ncivilisation.\" Now experience had proved that the belief was an\r\nillusion, and those who had tried to check the natural course of\r\nindustrial progress were constrained to confess that their efforts had\r\nbeen futile. Big factories were increasing in size and numbers, while\r\ncottage industries were disappearing or falling under the power of\r\nmiddlemen, and the Artels had not advanced a step in their expected\r\ndevelopment. The factory workers, though all of peasant origin, were\r\nlosing their connection with their native villages and abandoning\r\ntheir allotments of the Communal land. They were becoming, in short,\r\na hereditary caste in the town population, and the pleasant Slavophil\r\ndream of every factory worker having a house in the country was being\r\nrudely dispelled. Nor was there any prospect of a change for the better\r\nin the future. With the increase of competition among the manufacturers,\r\nthe uprooting of the muzhik from the soil must go on more and more\r\nrapidly, because employers must insist more and more on having\r\nthoroughly trained operatives ready to work steadily all the year round.\r\n\r\nThis state of things had a curious effect on the course of the\r\nrevolutionary movement.\r\n\r\nLet me recall very briefly the successive stages through which the\r\nmovement had already passed. It had been inaugurated, as we have\r\nseen, by the Nihilists, the ardent young representatives of a\r\n\"storm-and-stress\" period, in which the venerable traditions and\r\nrespected principles of the past were rejected and ridiculed, and the\r\nnewest ideas of Western Europe were eagerly adopted and distorted. Like\r\nthe majority of their educated countrymen, they believed that in the\r\nrace of progress Russia was about to overtake and surpass the nations of\r\nthe West, and that this desirable result was to be attained by making\r\na tabula rasa of existing institutions, and reconstructing society\r\naccording to the plans of Proudhon, Fourier, and the other writers of\r\nthe early Socialist school.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nihilists had expended their energies and exhausted the\r\npatience of the public in theorising, talking, and writing, a party of\r\naction came upon the scene. Like the Nihilists, they desired political,\r\nsocial, and economic reforms of the most thorough-going kind, but they\r\nbelieved that such things could not be effected by the educated classes\r\nalone, and they determined to call in the co-operation of the people.\r\nFor this purpose they tried to convert the masses to the gospel of\r\nSocialism. Hundreds of them became missionaries and \"went in among\r\nthe people.\" But the gospel of Socialism proved unintelligible to the\r\nuneducated, and the more ardent, incautious missionaries fell into the\r\nhands of the police. Those of them who escaped, perceiving the error\r\nof their ways, but still clinging to the hope of bringing about a\r\npolitical, social, and economic revolution, determined to change their\r\ntactics. The emancipated serf had shown himself incapable of \"prolonged\r\nrevolutionary activity,\" but there was reason to believe that he was,\r\nlike his forefathers in the time of Stenka Razin and Pugatcheff, capable\r\nof rising and murdering his oppressors. He must be used, therefore, for\r\nthe destruction of the Autocratic Power and the bureaucracy, and then\r\nit would be easy to reorganise society on a basis of universal equality,\r\nand to take permanent precautions against capitalism and the creation of\r\na proletariat.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the agitators proved as delusive as those of the\r\npropagandists. The muzhik turned a deaf ear to their instigations, and\r\nthe police soon prevented their further activity. Thus the would-be\r\nroot-and-branch reforms found themselves in a dilemma. Either they must\r\nabandon their schemes for the moment or they must strike immediately at\r\ntheir persecutors. They chose, as we have seen, the latter alternative,\r\nand after vain attempts to frighten the Government by acts of terrorism\r\nagainst zealous officials, they assassinated the Tsar himself; but\r\nbefore they had time to think of the constructive part of their task,\r\ntheir organisation was destroyed by the Autocratic Power and the\r\nbureaucracy, and those of them who escaped arrest had to seek safety in\r\nemigration to Switzerland and Paris.\r\n\r\nThen arose, all along the line of the defeated, decimated\r\nrevolutionists, the cry, \"What is to be done?\" Some replied that the\r\nshattered organisation should be reconstructed, and a number of secret\r\nagents were sent successively from Switzerland for this purpose.\r\nBut their efforts, as they themselves confessed, were fruitless, and\r\ndespondency seemed to be settling down permanently on all, except a few\r\nfanatics, when a voice was heard calling on the fugitives to rally round\r\na new banner and carry on the struggle by entirely new methods. The\r\nvoice came from a revolutionologist (if I may use such a term) of\r\nremarkable talent, called M. Plekhanof, who had settled in Geneva with\r\na little circle of friends, calling themselves the \"Labour Emancipation\r\nGroup.\" His views were expounded in a series of interesting\r\npublications, the first of which was a brochure entitled \"Socialism and\r\nthe Political Struggle,\" published in 1883.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Plekhanof and his group the revolutionary movement had\r\nbeen conducted up to that moment on altogether wrong lines. All previous\r\nrevolutionary groups had acted on the assumption that the political\r\nrevolution and the economic reorganisation of society must be effected\r\nsimultaneously, and consequently they had rejected contemptuously all\r\nproposals for reforms, however radical, of a merely political kind.\r\nThese had been considered, as I have mentioned in a previous chapter,\r\nnot only as worthless, but as positively prejudicial to the interests\r\nof the working classes, because so-called political liberties and\r\nparliamentary government would be sure to consolidate the domination of\r\nthe bourgeoisie. That such has generally been the immediate effect of\r\nparliamentary institutions is undeniable, but it did not follow that the\r\ncreation of such institutions should be opposed. On the contrary, they\r\nought to be welcomed, not merely because, as some revolutionists had\r\nalready pointed out, propaganda and agitation could be more easily\r\ncarried on under a constitutional regime, but because constitutionalism\r\nis certainly the most convenient, and perhaps the only, road by which\r\nthe socialistic ideal can ultimately be attained. This is a dark saying,\r\nbut it will become clearer when I have explained, according to the new\r\napostles, a second error into which their predecessors had fallen.\r\n\r\nThat second error was the assumption that all true friends of the\r\npeople, whether Conservatives, Liberals, or revolutionaries, ought to\r\noppose to the utmost the development of capitalism. In the light of Karl\r\nMarx\u0027s discoveries in economic science every one must recognise this to\r\nbe an egregious mistake. That great authority, it was said, had proved\r\nthat the development of capitalism was irresistible, and his conclusions\r\nhad been confirmed by the recent history of Russia, for all the economic\r\nprogress made during the last half century had been on capitalist lines.\r\n\r\nEven if it were possible to arrest the capitalist movement, it is not\r\ndesirable from the revolutionary point of view. In support of this\r\nthesis Karl Marx is again cited. He has shown that capitalism, though an\r\nevil in itself, is a necessary stage of economic and social progress. At\r\nfirst it is prejudicial to the interests of the working classes, but\r\nin the long run it benefits them, because the ever-growing proletariat\r\nmust, whether it desires it or not, become a political party, and as a\r\npolitical party it must one day break the domination of the bourgeoisie.\r\nAs soon as it has obtained the predominant political power, it\r\nwill confiscate, for the public good, the instruments of\r\nproduction--factories, foundries, machines, etc.--by expropriating the\r\ncapitalist. In this way all the profits which accrue from production\r\non a large scale, and which at present go into the pockets of the\r\ncapitalists, will be distributed equally among the workmen.\r\n\r\nThus began a new phase of the revolutionary movement, and, like all\r\nprevious phases, it remained for some years in the academic stage,\r\nduring which there were endless discussions on theoretical and practical\r\nquestions. Lavroff, the prophet of the old propaganda, treated the\r\nnew ideas \"with grandfatherly severity,\" and Tikhomirof, the leading\r\nrepresentative of the moribund Narodnaya Volya, which had prepared the\r\nacts of terrorism, maintained stoutly that the West European methods\r\nrecommended by Plekhanof were inapplicable to Russia. The Plekhanof\r\ngroup replied in a long series of publications, partly original and\r\npartly translations from Marx and Engels, explaining the doctrines and\r\naims of the Social Democrats.\r\n\r\nSeven years were spent in this academic literary activity--a period of\r\ncomparative repose for the Russian secret police--and about 1890\r\nthe propagandists of the new school began to work cautiously in St.\r\nPetersburg. At first they confined themselves to forming little secret\r\ncircles for making converts, and they found that the ground had been\r\nto some extent prepared for the seed which they had to sow. The workmen\r\nwere discontented, and some of the more intelligent amongst them who had\r\nformerly been in touch with the propagandists of the older generation\r\nhad learned that there was an ingenious and effective means of getting\r\ntheir grievances redressed. How was that possible? By combination and\r\nstrikes. For the uneducated workers this was an important discovery, and\r\nthey soon began to put the suggested remedy to a practical test. In the\r\nautumn of 1894 labour troubles broke out in the Nevski engineering works\r\nand the arsenal, and in the following year in the Thornton factory and\r\nthe cigarette works. In all these strikes the Social Democratic agents\r\ntook part behind the scenes. Avoiding the main errors of the old\r\npropagandists, who had offered the workmen merely abstract Socialist\r\ntheories which no uneducated person could reasonably be expected to\r\nunderstand, they adopted a more rational method. Though impervious to\r\nabstract theories, the Russian workman is not at all insensible to the\r\nprospect of bettering his material condition and getting his everyday\r\ngrievances redressed. Of these grievances the ones he felt most keenly\r\nwere the long hours, the low wages, the fines arbitrarily imposed by\r\nthe managers, and the brutal severity of the foreman. By helping him\r\nto have these grievances removed the Social Democratic agents might gain\r\nhis confidence, and when they had come to be regarded by him as his real\r\nfriends they might widen his sympathies and teach him to feel that his\r\npersonal interests were identical with the interests of the working\r\nclasses as a whole. In this way it would be possible to awaken in the\r\nindustrial proletariat generally a sort of esprit de corps, which is the\r\nfirst condition of political organisation.\r\n\r\nOn these lines the agents set to work. Having formed themselves into a\r\nsecret association called the \"Union for the Emancipation of the\r\nWorking Classes,\" they gradually abandoned the narrow limits of\r\ncoterie-propaganda, and prepared the way for agitation on a larger\r\nscale. Among the discontented workmen they distributed a large number\r\nof carefully written tracts, in which the material grievances were\r\nformulated, and the whole political system, with its police, gendarmes,\r\nCossacks, and tax-gathers, was criticised in no friendly spirit,\r\nbut without violent language. In introducing into the programme this\r\npolitical element, great caution had to be exercised, because the\r\nworkmen did not yet perceive clearly any close connection between their\r\ngrievances and the existing political institutions, and those of\r\nthem who belonged to the older generation regarded the Tsar as the\r\nincarnation of disinterested benevolence. Bearing this in mind, the\r\nUnion circulated a pamphlet for the enlightenment of the labouring\r\npopulation, in which the writer refrained from all reference to the\r\nAutocratic Power, and described simply the condition of the labouring\r\nclasses, the heavy burdens they had to bear, the abuses of which they\r\nwere the victims, and the inconsiderate way in which they were treated\r\nby their employers. This pamphlet was eagerly read, and from that moment\r\nwhenever labour troubles arose the men applied to the Social Democratic\r\nagents to assist them in formulating their grievances.\r\n\r\nOf course, the assistance had to be given secretly, because there were\r\nalways police spies in the factories, and all persons suspected of\r\naiding the labour movement were liable to be arrested and exiled. In\r\nspite of this danger the work was carried on with great energy, and\r\nin the summer of 1896 the field of operations was extended. During the\r\ncoronation ceremonies of that year the factories and workshops in St.\r\nPetersburg were closed, and the men considered that for these days they\r\nought to receive wages as usual. When their demand was refused, 40,000\r\nof them went out on strike. The Social Democratic Union seized the\r\nopportunity and distributed tracts in large quantities. For the first\r\ntime such tracts were read aloud at workmen\u0027s meetings and applauded by\r\nthe audience. The Union encouraged the workmen in their resistance,\r\nbut advised them to refrain from violence, so as not to provoke the\r\nintervention of the police and the military, as they had imprudently\r\ndone on some previous occasions. When the police did intervene and\r\nexpelled some of the strike-leaders from St. Petersburg, the agitators\r\nhad an excellent opportunity of explaining that the authorities were\r\nthe protectors of the employers and the enemies of the working classes.\r\nThese explanations counteracted the effect of an official proclamation\r\nto the workmen, in which M. Witte tried to convince them that the Tsar\r\nwas constantly striving to improve their condition. The struggle was\r\ndecided, not by arguments and exhortations, but by a more potent force;\r\nhaving no funds for continuing the strike, the men were compelled by\r\nstarvation to resume work.\r\n\r\nThis is the point at which the labour movement began to be conducted\r\non a large scale and by more systematic methods. In the earlier labour\r\ntroubles the strikers had not understood that the best means of bringing\r\npressure on employers was simply to refuse to work, and they had often\r\nproceeded to show their dissatisfaction by ruthlessly destroying their\r\nemployers\u0027 property. This had brought the police, and sometimes the\r\nmilitary, on the scene, and numerous arrests had followed. Another\r\nmistake made by the inexperienced strikers was that they had neglected\r\nto create a reserve fund from which they could draw the means of\r\nsubsistence when they no longer received wages and could no longer\r\nobtain credit at the factory provision store. Efforts were now made\r\nto correct these two mistakes, and with regard to the former they were\r\nfairly successful, for wanton destruction of property ceased to be a\r\nprominent feature of labour troubles; but strong reserve funds have not\r\nyet been created, so that the strikes have never been of long duration.\r\n\r\nThough the strikes had led, so far, to no great practical, tangible\r\nresults, the new ideas and aspirations were spreading rapidly in the\r\nfactories and workshops, and they had already struck such deep root\r\nthat some of the genuine workmen wished to have a voice in the managing\r\ncommittee of the Union, which was composed exclusively of educated men.\r\nWhen a request to that effect was rejected by the committee a lengthy\r\ndiscussion took place, and it soon became evident that underneath the\r\nquestion of organisation lay a most important question of principle. The\r\nworkmen wished to concentrate their efforts on the improvement of their\r\nmaterial condition, and to proceed on what we should call trade-unionist\r\nlines, whereas the committee wished them to aim also at the acquisition\r\nof political rights. Great determination was shown on both sides. An\r\nattempt of the workmen to maintain a secret organ of their own with the\r\nview of emancipating themselves from the \"Politicals\" ended in failure;\r\nbut they received sympathy and support from some of the educated members\r\nof the party, and in this way a schism took place in the Social Democrat\r\ncamp. After repeated ineffectual attempts to find a satisfactory\r\ncompromise, the question was submitted to a Congress which was held\r\nin Switzerland in 1900; but the discussions merely accentuated the\r\ndifferences of opinion, and the two parties constituted themselves into\r\nseparate independent groups. The one under the leadership of Plekhanof,\r\nand calling itself the Revolutionary Social Democrats, held to the Marx\r\ndoctrines in all their extent and purity, and maintained the necessity\r\nof constant agitation in the political sense. The other, calling itself\r\nthe Union of Foreign Social Democrats, inclined to the trade-unionism\r\nprogramme, and proclaimed the necessity of being guided by political\r\nexpediency rather than inflexible dogmas. Between the two a wordy\r\nwarfare was carried on for some time in pedantic, technical language;\r\nbut though habitually brandishing their weapons and denouncing their\r\nantagonists in true Homeric style, they were really allies, struggling\r\ntowards a common end--two sections of the Social Democratic party\r\ndiffering from each other on questions of tactics.\r\n\r\nThe two divergent tendencies have often reappeared in the subsequent\r\nhistory of the movement. During ordinary peaceful times the economic\r\nor trade-unionist tendency can generally hold its own, but as soon as\r\ndisturbances occur and the authorities have to intervene, the political\r\ncurrent quickly gains the upper hand. This was exemplified in the labour\r\ntroubles which took place at Rostoff-on-the-Don in 1902. During the\r\nfirst two days of the strike the economic demands alone were put\r\nforward, and in the speeches which were delivered at the meetings of\r\nworkmen no reference was made to political grievances. On the third day\r\none orator ventured to speak disrespectfully of the Autocratic Power,\r\nbut he thereby provoked signs of dissatisfaction in the audiences. On\r\nthe fifth and following days, however, several political speeches were\r\nmade, ending with the cry of \"Down with Tsarism!\" and a crowd of 30,000\r\nworkmen agreed with the speakers. Thereafter occurred similar strikes\r\nin Odessa, the Caucasus, Kief, and Central Russia, and they had all a\r\npolitical rather than a purely economic character.\r\n\r\nI must now endeavour to explain clearly the point of view and plan\r\nof campaign of this new movement, which I may call the revolutionary\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate aim of the new reformers was the same as that of all their\r\npredecessors--the thorough reorganisation of Society on Socialistic\r\nprinciples. According to their doctrines, Society as at present\r\nconstituted consists of two great classes, called variously the\r\nexploiters and the exploited, the shearers and the shorn, the\r\ncapitalists and the workers, the employers and the employed, the tyrants\r\nand the oppressed; and this unsatisfactory state of things must go on so\r\nlong as the so-called bourgeois or capitalist regime continues to exist.\r\nIn the new heaven and the new earth of which the Socialist dreams this\r\nunjust distinction is to disappear; all human beings are to be equally\r\nfree and independent, all are to cooperate spontaneously with brains\r\nand hands to the common good, and all are to enjoy in equal shares the\r\nnatural and artificial good things of this life.\r\n\r\nSo far there has never been any difference of opinion among the various\r\ngroups of Russian thorough-going revolutionists. All of them, from the\r\nantiquated Nihilist down to the Social Democrat of the latest type, have\r\nheld these views. What has differentiated them from each other is the\r\ngreater or less degree of impatience to realise the ideal.\r\n\r\nThe most impatient were the Anarchists, who grouped themselves around\r\nBakunin. They wished to overthrow immediately by a frontal attack all\r\nexisting forms of government and social organisation, in the hope that\r\nchance, or evolution, or natural instinct, or sudden inspiration or some\r\nother mysterious force, would create something better. They themselves\r\ndeclined to aid this mysterious force even by suggestions, on the ground\r\nthat, as one of them has said, \"to construct is not the business of\r\nthe generation whose duty is to destroy.\" Notwithstanding the\r\nstrong impulsive element in the national character, the reckless,\r\nultra-impatient doctrinaires never became numerous, and never succeeded\r\nin forming an organised group, probably because the young generation in\r\nRussia were too much occupied with the actual and future condition of\r\ntheir own country to embark on schemes of cosmopolitan anarchism such as\r\nBakunin recommended.\r\n\r\nNext in the scale of impatience came the group of believers in Socialist\r\nagitation among the masses, with a view to overturning the existing\r\nGovernment and putting themselves in its place as soon as the masses\r\nwere sufficiently organised to play the part destined for them. Between\r\nthem and the Anarchists the essential points of difference were that\r\nthey admitted the necessity of some years of preparation, and\r\nthey intended, when the Government was overturned, not to preserve\r\nindefinitely the state of anarchy, but to put in the place of autocracy,\r\nlimited monarchy, or the republic, a strong, despotic Government\r\nthoroughly imbued with Socialistic principles. As soon as it had laid\r\nfirmly the foundations of the new order of things it was to call a\r\nNational Assembly, from which it was to receive, I presume, a bill of\r\nindemnity for the benevolent tyranny which it had temporarily exercised.\r\n\r\nImpatience a few degrees less intense produced the next group, the\r\npartisans of pacific Socialist propaganda. They maintained that there\r\nwas no necessity for overthrowing the old order of things till the\r\nmasses had been intellectually prepared for the new, and they objected\r\nto the foundation of the new regime being laid by despots, however\r\nwell-intentioned in the Socialist sense. The people must be made happy\r\nand preserved in a state of happiness by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the last place came the least impatient of all, the Social Democrats,\r\nwho differ widely from all the preceding categories.\r\n\r\nAll previous revolutionary groups had systematically rejected the idea\r\nof a gradual transition from the bourgeois to the Socialist regime. They\r\nwould not listen to any suggestion about a constitutional monarchy or\r\na democratic republic even as a mere intermediate stage of social\r\ndevelopment. All such things, as part and parcel of the bourgeois\r\nsystem, were anathematised. There must be no half-way houses between\r\npresent misery and future happiness; for many weary travellers might be\r\ntempted to settle there in the desert, and fail to reach the promised\r\nland. \"Ever onward\" should be the watchword, and no time should be\r\nwasted on the foolish struggles of political parties and the empty\r\nvanities of political life.\r\n\r\nNot thus thought the Social Democrat. He was much wiser in his\r\ngeneration. Having seen how the attempts of the impatient groups had\r\nended in disaster, and knowing that, if they had succeeded, the old\r\neffete despotism would probably have been replaced by a young, vigorous\r\none more objectionable than its predecessor, he determined to try a more\r\ncircuitous but surer road to the goal which the impatient people had\r\nin view. In his opinion the distance from the present Russian regime\r\nprotected by autocracy to the future Socialist paradise was far too\r\ngreat to be traversed in a single stage, and he knew of one or two\r\ncomfortable rest-houses on the way. First there was the rest-house of\r\nConstitutionalism, with parliamentary institutions. For some years\r\nthe bourgeoisie would doubtless have a parliamentary majority, but\r\ngradually, by persistent effort, the Fourth Estate would gain the upper\r\nhand, and then the Socialist millennium might be proclaimed. Meanwhile,\r\nwhat had to be done was to gain the confidence of the masses, especially\r\nof the factory workers, who were more intelligent and less conservative\r\nthan the peasantry, and to create powerful labour organisations as\r\nmaterial for a future political party.\r\n\r\nThis programme implied, of course, a certain unity of action with the\r\nconstitutionalists, from whom, as I have said, the revolutionists of\r\nthe old school had stood sternly aloof. There was now no question of a\r\nformal union, and certainly no idea of a \"union of hearts,\" because the\r\nSocialists knew that their ultimate aim would be strenuously opposed by\r\nthe Liberals, and the Liberals knew that an attempt was being made to\r\nuse them as a cat\u0027s-paw; but there seemed to be no reason why they\r\nof the two groups should not observe towards each other a benevolent\r\nneutrality, and march side by side as far as the half-way house, where\r\nthey could consider the conditions of the further advance.\r\n\r\nWhen I first became acquainted with the Russian Social Democrats I\r\nimagined that their plan of campaign was of a purely pacific character;\r\nand that they were, unlike their predecessors, an evolutionary, as\r\ndistinguished from a revolutionary, party. Subsequently I discovered\r\nthat this conception was not quite accurate. In ordinary quiet times\r\nthey use merely pacific methods, and they feel that the Proletariat is\r\nnot yet sufficiently prepared, intellectually and politically, to assume\r\nthe great responsibilities which are reserved for it in the future.\r\nMoreover, when the moment comes for getting rid of the Autocratic\r\nPower, they would prefer a gradual process of liquidation to a sudden\r\ncataclysm. So far they may be said to be evolutionaries rather than\r\nrevolutionaries, but their plan of campaign does not entirely exclude\r\nviolence. They would not consider it their duty to oppose the use\r\nof violence on the part of the more impatient sections of the\r\nrevolutionists, and they would have no scruples about utilising\r\ndisturbances for the attainment of their own end. Public agitation,\r\nwhich is always likely in Russia to provoke violent repression by\r\nthe authorities, they regard as necessary for keeping alive and\r\nstrengthening the spirit of opposition; and when force is used by the\r\npolice they approve of the agitators using force in return. To acts of\r\nterrorism, however, they are opposed on principle.\r\n\r\nWho, then, are the Terrorists, who have assassinated so many great\r\npersonages, including the Grand Duke Serge? In reply to this question\r\nI must introduce the reader to another group of the revolutionists who\r\nhave usually been in hostile, rather than friendly, relations with the\r\nSocial Democrats, and who call themselves the Socialist-Revolutionaries\r\n(Sotsialisty-Revolutsionery).\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the terrorist group, commonly called\r\nNarodnaya Volya, or Narodovoltsi, which succeeded in assassinating\r\nAlexander II., were very soon broken up by the police and most of the\r\nleading members were arrested. A few escaped, of whom some remained in\r\nthe country and others emigrated to Switzerland or Paris, and efforts\r\nat reorganisation were made, especially in the southern and western\r\nprovinces, but they proved ineffectual. At last, sobered by experience\r\nand despairing of further success, some of the prisoners and a few of\r\nthe exiles--notably Tikhomirof, who was regarded as the leader--made\r\ntheir peace with the Government, and for some years terrorism seemed to\r\nbe a thing of the past. Passing through Russia on my way home from India\r\nand Central Asia at that time, I came to the conclusion that the young\r\ngeneration had recovered from its prolonged attack of brain-fever, and\r\nhad entered on a more normal, tranquil, and healthy period of existence.\r\n\r\nMy expectations proved too optimistic. About 1894 the Narodnaya Volya\r\ncame to life again, with all its terrorist traditions intact; and\r\nshortly afterwards appeared the new group which I have just mentioned,\r\nthe Socialist-Revolutionaries, with somewhat similar principles and\r\na better organisation. For some seven or eight years the two groups\r\nexisted side by side, and then the Narodnaya Volya disappeared, absorbed\r\nprobably by its more powerful rival.\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of their existence neither group was strong\r\nenough to cause the Government serious inconvenience, and it was not\r\ntill 1897-98 that they found means of issuing manifestos and programmes.\r\nIn these the Narodovoltsi declared that their immediate aims were the\r\nannihilation of Autocracy, the convocation of a National Assembly and\r\nthe reorganisation of the Empire on the principles of federation and\r\nlocal self-government, and that for the attainment of these objects\r\nthe means to be employed should include popular insurrections, military\r\nconspiracies, bombs and dynamite.\r\n\r\nVery similar, though ostensibly a little more eclectic, was the\r\nprogramme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. Their ultimate aim was\r\ndeclared to be the transfer of political authority from the Autocratic\r\nPower to the people, the abolition of private property in the means\r\nof production, and in general the reorganisation of national life on\r\nSocialist principles. On certain points they were at one with the Social\r\nDemocrats. They recognised, for example, that the social reorganisation\r\nmust be preceded by a political revolution, that much preparatory\r\nwork was necessary, and that attention should be directed first to the\r\nindustrial proletariat as the most intelligent section of the masses.\r\nOn the other hand they maintained that it was a mistake to confine the\r\nrevolutionary activity to the working classes of the towns, who were\r\nnot strong enough to overturn the Autocratic Power. The agitation ought,\r\ntherefore, to be extended to the peasantry, who were quite \"developed\"\r\nenough to understand at least the idea of land-nationalisation; and for\r\nthe carrying out of this part of the programme a special organisation\r\nwas created.\r\n\r\nWith so many opinions in common, it seemed at one moment as if the\r\nSocial Democrats and the Socialist-Revolutionaries might unite their\r\nforces for a combined attack on the Government; but apart from the\r\nmutual jealousy and hatred which so often characterise revolutionary as\r\nwell as religious sects, they were prevented from coalescing, or even\r\ncordially co-operating, by profound differences both in doctrine and in\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democrats are essentially doctrinaires. Thorough-going\r\ndisciples of Karl Marx, they believed in what they consider the\r\nimmutable laws of social progress, according to which the Socialistic\r\nideal can be reached only through capitalism; and the intermediate\r\npolitical revolution, which is to substitute the will of the people\r\nfor the Autocratic Power, must be effected by the conversion and\r\norganisation of the industrial proletariat. With the spiritual pride of\r\nmen who feel themselves to be the incarnations or avatars of immutable\r\nlaw, they are inclined to look down with something very like contempt on\r\nmere empirics who are ignorant of scientific principles and are guided\r\nby considerations of practical expediency. The Social-Revolutionaries\r\nseem to them to be empirics of this kind because they reject the tenets,\r\nor at least deny the infallibility, of the Marx school, cling to the\r\nidea of partially resisting the overwhelming influence of capitalism in\r\nRussia, hope that the peasantry will play at least a secondary part in\r\nbringing about the political revolution, and are profoundly convinced\r\nthat the advent of political liberty may be greatly accelerated by\r\nthe use of terrorism. On this last point they stated their views very\r\nfrankly in a pamphlet which they published in 1902 under the title of\r\n\"Our Task\" (Nasha Zadatcha). It is there said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One of the powerful means of struggle, dictated by our revolutionary\r\npast and present, is political terrorism, consisting of the annihilation\r\nof the most injurious and influential personages of Russian autocracy in\r\ngiven conditions. Systematic terrorism, in conjunction with other\r\nforms of open mass-struggle (industrial riots and agrarian risings,\r\ndemonstrations, etc.), which receive from terrorism an enormous,\r\ndecisive significance, will lead to the disorganisation of the enemy.\r\nTerrorist activity will cease only with the victory over autocracy\r\nand the complete attainment of political liberty. Besides its chief\r\nsignificance as a means of disorganising, terrorist activity will serve\r\nat the same time as a means of propaganda and agitation, a form of open\r\nstruggle taking place before the eyes of the whole people, undermining\r\nthe prestige of Government authority, and calling into life new\r\nrevolutionary forces, while the oral and literary propaganda is being\r\ncontinued without interruption. Lastly, the terrorist activity serves\r\nfor the whole secret revolutionary party as a means of self-defence and\r\nof protecting the organisation against the injurious elements of spies\r\nand treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this theory a \"militant organisation\" (Boevaga\r\nOrganisatsia) was formed and soon set to work with revolvers and\r\nbombs. First an attempt was made on the life of Pobedonostsef; then the\r\nMinister of the Interior, Sipiagin, was assassinated; next attempts were\r\nmade on the lives of the Governors of Vilna and Kharkof, and the\r\nKharkof chief of police; and since that time the Governor of Ufa, the\r\nVice-Governor of Elizabetpol, the Minister of the Interior, M. Plehve,\r\nand the Grand Duke Serge have fallen victims to the terrorist policy.*\r\n\r\n     * In this list I have not mentioned the assassination of M.\r\n     Bogolyepof, Minister of Public Instruction, in 1901, because\r\n     I do not know whether it should be attributed to the\r\n     Socialist-Revolutionaries or to the Narodovoltsi, who had\r\n     not yet amalgamated with them.\r\n\r\nThough the Social Democrats have no sentimental squeamishness about\r\nbloodshed, they objected to this policy on the ground that acts of\r\nterrorism were unnecessary and were apt to prove injurious rather than\r\nbeneficial to the revolutionist cause. One of the main objects of every\r\nintelligent revolutionary party should be to awaken all classes from\r\ntheir habitual apathy and induce them to take an active part in the\r\npolitical movement; but terrorism must have a contrary effect by\r\nsuggesting that political freedom is to be attained, not by the steady\r\npressure and persevering cooperation of the people, but by startling,\r\nsensational acts of individual heroism.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of these two revolutionary parties, as well as of minor\r\ngroups, to get hold of the industrial proletariat did not escape the\r\nnotice of the authorities; and during the labour troubles of 1896, on\r\nthe suggestion of M. Witte, the Government had considered the question\r\nas to what should be done to counteract the influence of the agitators.\r\nOn that question it had no difficulty in coming to a decision; the\r\ncondition of the working classes must be improved. An expert official\r\nwas accordingly instructed to write a report on what had already been\r\ndone in that direction. In his report it was shown that the Government\r\nhad long been thinking about the subject. Not to speak of a still-born\r\nlaw about a ten-hour day for artisans, dating from the time of Catherine\r\nII., an Imperial commission had been appointed as early as 1859, but\r\nnothing practical came of its deliberations until 1882, when legislative\r\nmeasures were taken for the protection of women and children in\r\nfactories. A little later (1886) other grievances were dealt with and\r\npartly removed by regulating contracts of hire, providing that the money\r\nderived from deductions and fines should not be appropriated by the\r\nemployers, and creating a staff of factory inspectors who should take\r\ncare that the benevolent intentions of the Government were duly carried\r\nout. Having reviewed all these official efforts in 1896, the Government\r\npassed in the following year a law prohibiting night work and limiting\r\nthe working day to eleven and a half hours.\r\n\r\nThis did not satisfy the workmen. Their wages were still low, and it\r\nwas difficult to get them increased because strikes and all forms of\r\nassociation were still, as they had always been, criminal offences. On\r\nthis point the Government remained firm so far as the law was concerned,\r\nbut it gradually made practical concessions by allowing the workmen\r\nto combine for certain purposes. In 1898, for example, in Kharkof, the\r\nEngineers\u0027 Mutual Aid Society was sanctioned, and gradually it became\r\ncustomary to allow the workmen to elect delegates for the discussion of\r\ntheir grievances with the employers and inspectors.\r\n\r\nFinding that these concessions did not check the growing influence of\r\nthe Social Democratic agitators among the operatives, the Government\r\nresolved to go a step further; it would organise the workers on purely\r\ntrade-unionist lines, and would thereby combat the Social Democrats,\r\nwho always advised the strikers to mix up political demands with their\r\nmaterial grievances. The project seemed to have a good prospect of\r\nsuccess, because there were many workmen, especially of the older\r\ngeneration, who did not at all like the mixing up of politics, which so\r\noften led to arrest, imprisonment and exile, with the practical concerns\r\nof every day life.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of the kind was made in Moscow under the direction of\r\na certain Zubatof, chief of the secret police, who had been himself a\r\nrevolutionary in his youth, and afterwards an agent provocateur. Aided\r\nby Tikhomirof, the repentant terrorist whom I have already mentioned,\r\nZubatof organised a large workmen\u0027s association, with reading-rooms,\r\nlectures, discussions and other attractions, and sought to convince\r\nthe members that they should turn a deaf ear to the Social Democratic\r\nagents, and look only to the Government for the improvement of their\r\ncondition. In order to gain their sympathy and confidence, he instructed\r\nhis subordinates to take the side of the workmen in all labour disputes,\r\nwhile he himself brought official pressure to bear on the employers. By\r\nthis means he made a considerable number of converts, and for a time the\r\nassociation seemed to prosper, but he did not possess the extraordinary\r\nability and tact required to play the complicated game successfully,\r\nand he committed the fatal mistake of using the office-bearers of the\r\nassociation as detectives for the discovery of the \"evil-intentioned.\"\r\nThis tactical error had its natural consequences. As soon as the workmen\r\nperceived that their professed benefactors were police spies, who\r\ndid not obtain for them any real improvement of their condition, the\r\npopularity of the association rapidly declined. At the same time, the\r\nfactory owners complained to the Minister of Finance that the police,\r\nwho ought to be guardians of public order, and who had accused\r\nthe factory inspectors of stirring up discontent in the labouring\r\npopulation, were themselves creating troubles by inciting the workmen\r\nto make inordinate demands. The Minister of Finance at the moment was\r\nM. Witte, and the Minister of Interior, responsible for the acts of the\r\npolice, was M. Plehve, and between these two official dignitaries, who\r\nwere already in very strained relations, Zubatof\u0027s activity formed a new\r\nbase of contention. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the\r\nvery risky experiment came to an untimely end.\r\n\r\nIn St. Petersburg a similar experiment was made, and it ended much more\r\ntragically. There the chief rôle was played by a mysterious personage\r\ncalled Father Gapon, who acquired great momentary notoriety. Though a\r\ngenuine priest, he did not belong by birth, as most Russian priests\r\ndo, to the ecclesiastical caste. The son of a peasant in Little Russia,\r\nwhere the ranks of the clergy are not hermetically sealed against\r\nthe other social classes, he aspired to take orders, and after being\r\nrusticated from a seminary for supposed sympathy with revolutionary\r\nideas, he contrived to finish his studies and obtain ordination. During\r\na residence in Moscow he took part in the Zubatof experiment, and\r\nwhen that badly conducted scheme collapsed he was transferred to St.\r\nPetersburg and appointed chaplain to a large convict prison. His new\r\nprofessional duties did not prevent him from continuing to take a keen\r\ninterest in the welfare of the working classes, and in the summer of\r\n1904 he became, with the approval of the police authorities, president\r\nof a large labour union called the Society of Russian Workmen, which had\r\neleven sections in the various industrial suburbs of the capital. Under\r\nhis guidance the experiment proceeded for some months very successfully.\r\nHe gained the sympathy and confidence of the workmen, and so long as\r\nno serious questions arose he kept his hold on them; but a storm was\r\nbrewing and he proved unequal to the occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of 1905, when the economic consequences of the war\r\nhad come to be keenly felt, a spirit of discontent appeared among\r\nthe labouring population of St. Petersburg, and on Sunday, January\r\n15th--exactly a week before the famous Sunday when the troops were\r\ncalled into play--a strike began in the Putilof ironworks and spread\r\nlike wildfire to the other big works in the neighbourhood. The immediate\r\ncause of the disturbance was the dismissal of some workmen and a demand\r\non the part of the labour union that they should be reinstated. A\r\ndeputation, composed partly of genuine workmen and partly of Social\r\nDemocratic agitators, and led by Gapon, negotiated with the managers of\r\nthe Putilof works, and failed to effect an arrangement. At this moment\r\nGapon tried hard to confine the negotiations to the points in dispute,\r\nwhereas the agitators put forward demands of a wider kind, such as the\r\neight-hour working day, and they gradually obtained his concurrence\r\non condition that no political demands should be introduced into the\r\nprogramme. In defending this condition he was supported by the workmen,\r\nso that when agitators tried to make political speeches at the meetings\r\nthey were unceremoniously expelled.\r\n\r\nA similar struggle between the \"Economists\" and the \"Politicals\" was\r\ngoing on in the other industrial suburbs, notably in the Nevski quarter,\r\nwhere 45,000 operatives had struck work, and the Social Democrats\r\nwere particularly active. In this section of the Labour Union the most\r\ninfluential member was a young workman called Petroff, who was a staunch\r\nGaponist in the sense that he wished the workers to confine themselves\r\nto their own grievances and to resist the introduction of political\r\ndemands. At first he succeeded in preventing the agitators from speaking\r\nat the meetings, but they soon proved too much for him. At one of the\r\nmeetings on Tuesday, when he happened to be absent, a Social Democrat\r\ncontrived to get himself elected chairman, and from that moment the\r\npolitical agitators had a free hand. They had a regular organisation\r\ncomposed of an organiser, three \"oratorical agitators,\" and several\r\nassistant-organisers who attended the small meetings in the operatives\u0027\r\nsleeping-quarters. Besides these there were a certain number of workmen\r\nalready converted to Social Democratic principles who had learned the\r\nart of making political speeches.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the agitators to the central organisation, written\r\nhurriedly during this eventful week, are extremely graphic and\r\ninteresting. They declared that there is a frightful amount of work\r\nto be done and very few to do it. Their stock of Social Democratic\r\npamphlets is exhausted and they are hoarse from speech-making. In spite\r\nof their superhuman efforts the masses remain frightfully \"undeveloped.\"\r\nThe men willingly collect to hear the orators, listen to them\r\nattentively, express approval or dissent, and even put questions;\r\nbut with all this they remain obstinately on the ground of their own\r\nimmediate wants, such as the increase of wages and protection against\r\nbrutal foremen, and they only hint vaguely at more serious demands. The\r\nagitators, however, are equally obstinate, and they make a few converts.\r\nTo illustrate how conversions are made, the following incident is\r\nrelated. At one meeting the cry of \"Stop the war!\" is raised by an\r\norator without sufficient preparation, and at once a voice is heard\r\nin the audience saying. \"No, no! The little Japs (Yaposhki) must\r\nbe beaten!\" Thereupon a more experienced orator comes forward and a\r\ncharacteristic conversation takes place:\r\n\r\n\"Have we much land of our own, my friends?\" asks the orator.\r\n\r\n\"Much!\" replies the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Do we require Manchuria?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who pays for the war?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are our brothers dying, and do your wives and children remain without a\r\nbit of bread?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is!\" say many, with a significant shake of the head.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded so far, the orator tries to turn the popular\r\nindignation against the Tsar by explaining that he is to blame for all\r\nthis misery and suffering, but Petroff suddenly appears on the scene and\r\nmaintains that for the misery and suffering the Tsar is not at all\r\nto blame, for he knows nothing about it. It is all the fault of his\r\nservants, the tchinovniks.\r\n\r\nBy this device Petroff suppresses the seditious cry of \"Down with\r\nautocracy!\" which the Social Democrats were anxious to make the\r\nwatchword of the movement, but he has thereby been drawn from his\r\nstrong position of \"No politics,\" and he is standing, as we shall see\r\npresently, on a slippery incline.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday and Friday the activity of the leaders and the excitement\r\nof the masses increase. While the Gaponists speak merely of local\r\ngrievances and material wants, the Social Democrats incite their hearers\r\nto a political struggle, advising them to demand a Constituent Assembly,\r\nand explaining the necessity for all workmen to draw together and form a\r\npowerful political party. The haranguing goes on from morning to night,\r\nand agitators drive about from one factory to another to keep the\r\nexcitement at fever-heat. The police, usually so active on such\r\noccasions, do not put in an appearance. Prince Sviatopolk Mirski, the\r\nhonest, well-intentioned, liberal Minister of the Interior, cannot make\r\nup his mind to act with energy, and lets things drift. The agitators\r\nthemselves are astonished at this extraordinary inactivity. One of them,\r\nwriting a few days afterwards, says: \"The police was paralysed. It would\r\nhave been easy to arrest Gapon, and discover the orators. On Friday the\r\nclubs might have been surrounded and the orators arrested. . . . In a\r\nword, decided measures might have been taken, but they were not.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not only Petroff that has abandoned his strong position of \"No\r\npolitics\"; Gapon is doing likewise. The movement has spread far beyond\r\nwhat he expected, and he is being carried away by the prevailing\r\nexcitement. With all his benevolent intentions, he is of a nervous,\r\nexcitable nature, and his besetting sin is vanity. He perceives that\r\nby resisting the Social Democrats he is losing his hold on the masses.\r\nEarly in the week, as we have seen, he began to widen his programme in\r\nthe Social Democratic sense, and every day he makes new concessions.\r\nBefore the week is finished a Social Democratic orator can write\r\ntriumphantly: \"In three days we have transformed the Gaponist assemblies\r\ninto political meetings!\" Like Petroff, Gapon seeks to defend the Tsar,\r\nand he falls into Petroff\u0027s strategical mistake of pretending that the\r\nTsar knows nothing of the sufferings of his people. From that admission\r\nto the resolution that the Tsar must somehow be informed personally and\r\ndirectly, by some means outside of the regular official channel, there\r\nis but one step, and that step is quickly taken. On Friday morning Gapon\r\nhas determined to present with his own hands a petition to his Majesty,\r\nand the petition is already drafted, containing demands which go far\r\nbeyond workmen\u0027s grievances. After resisting the Social Democratic\r\nagitators so stoutly, he is now going over, bag and baggage, to the\r\nSocial Democratic camp.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful change was consummated on Friday evening at a conference\r\nwhich he held with some delegates of the Social Democrats. From an\r\naccount written by one of these delegates immediately after the meeting\r\nwe get an insight into the worthy priest\u0027s character and motives. In the\r\nmorning he had written to them: \"I have 100,000 workmen, and I am going\r\nwith them to the Palace to present a petition. If it is not granted,\r\nwe shall make a revolution. Do you agree?\" They did not like the idea,\r\nbecause the Social Democratic policy is to extort concessions, not\r\nto ask favours, and to refrain from anything that might increase the\r\nprestige of the Autocratic Power. In their reply, therefore, they\r\nconsented simply to discuss the matter. I proceed now to quote from the\r\ndelegate\u0027s account of what took place at the conference:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The company consisted of Gapon, with two adherents, and five Social\r\nDemocrats. All sat round a table, and the conversation began. Gapon is a\r\ngood-looking man, with dark complexion and thoughtful, sympathetic face.\r\nHe is evidently very tired, and, like the other orators, he is hoarse.\r\nTo the questions addressed to him, he replies: \u0027The masses are at\r\npresent so electrified that you may lead them wherever you like. We\r\nshall go on Sunday to the Palace, and present a petition. If we are\r\nallowed to pass without hindrance, we shall march to the Palace Square,\r\nand summon the Tsar from Tsarskoe Selo. We shall wait for him till the\r\nevening. When he arrives, I shall go to him with a deputation, and\r\nin presenting to him the petition, I shall say: \u0027Your Majesty! Things\r\ncannot go on like this; it is time to give the people liberty.\u0027 (Tak\r\nnelzya! Para dat\u0027 narodu svobodu.) If he consents, we shall insist that\r\nhe take an oath before the people. Only then we shall come away, and\r\nwhen we begin to work, it will only be for eight hours a day. If, on the\r\nother hand, we are prevented from entering the city, we shall request\r\nand beg, and if they do not let us pass, we shall force our way. In the\r\nPalace Square we shall find troops, and we shall entreat them to come\r\nover to our side. If they beat us, we shall strike back. There will be\r\nsacrifices, but part of the troops will come over to us, and then,\r\nbeing ourselves strong in numbers, we shall make a revolution. We shall\r\nconstruct barricades, pillage the armourers\u0027 shops, break open\r\nthe prisons, and seize the telephones and telegraphs. The\r\nSocialist-Revolutionaries have promised us bombs, and the Democrats\r\nmoney: and we shall be victorious!*\r\n\r\n     * This confirms the information which comes to me from other\r\n     quarters that Gapon was already in friendly relations with\r\n     other revolutionary groups.\r\n\r\n\"Such, in a few words, were the ideas which Gapon expounded. The\r\nimpression he made on us was that he did not clearly realise where\r\nhe was going. Acting with sincerity, he was ready to die, but he was\r\nconvinced that the troops would not fire, and that the deputation would\r\nbe received by the Emperor. He did not distinguish between different\r\nmethods. Though not at all a partisan of violent means, he had become\r\ninfuriated against autocracy and the Tsar, as was shown by his language\r\nwhen he said: \u0027If that blockhead of a Tsar comes out\u0027 (Yesli etot durak\r\nTsar vuidet) . . . Burning with the desire to attain his object, he\r\nlooked on revolution like a child, as if it could be accomplished in a\r\nday with empty hands!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing that no previous preparations had been made for a revolution\r\nsuch as Gapon talked of, the Social Democratic agents tried to dissuade\r\nhim from carrying out his idea on Sunday, but he stood firm. He had\r\nalready committed himself publicly to the project. At a workmen\u0027s\r\nmeeting in another quarter (Vassiliostrof) earlier in the day he had\r\nexplained the petition, and said: \"Let us go to the Winter Palace and\r\nsummon the Emperor, and let us tell him our wants; if he does not listen\r\nto us we do not require him any longer.\" To a Social Democrat who shook\r\nhim warmly by the hand and expressed his astonishment that there should\r\nbe such a man among the clergy, he replied: \"I am no longer a priest; I\r\nam a fighter for liberty! They want to exile me, and for some nights I\r\nhave not slept at home.\" When offered assistance to escape arrest, he\r\nanswered laconically: \"Thanks; I have already a place of refuge.\"\r\nAfter his departure from the meeting one of his friends, to whom he had\r\nconfided a copy of the petition, rose and said: \"Now has arrived the\r\ngreat historical moment! Now we can and must demand rights and liberty!\"\r\nAfter hearing the petition read the meeting decided that if the Tsar\r\ndid not come out at the demand of the people strong measures should be\r\ntaken, and one orator indicated pretty plainly what they should be: \"We\r\ndon\u0027t require a Tsar who is deaf to the woes of the people; we shall\r\nperish ourselves, but we shall kill him. Swear that you will all come to\r\nthe Palace on Sunday at twelve o\u0027clock!\" The audience raised their hands\r\nin token of assent.\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to dissuade Gapon from his purpose, the Social\r\nDemocrats told him that they would take advantage of the circumstances\r\nindependently, and that if he was allowed to enter the city with his\r\ndeputation they would organise monster meetings in the Palace Square.\r\n\r\nThe imperious tone used by Gapon at the public meetings and private\r\nconsultations was adopted by him also in his letters to the Minister of\r\nthe Interior and to the Emperor. To the former he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The workmen and inhabitants of St. Petersburg of various classes desire\r\nto see the Tsar at two o\u0027clock on Sunday in the Winter Palace Square,\r\nin order to lay before him personally their needs and those of the\r\nwhole Russian people. . . . Tell the Tsar that I and the workmen,\r\nmany thousands in number, have peacefully, with confidence in him, but\r\nirrevocably, resolved to proceed to the Winter Palace. Let him show his\r\nconfidence by deeds, and not by manifestos.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Tsar himself his language was not more respectful:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sovereign,--I fear the Ministers have not told you the truth about the\r\nsituation. The whole people, trusting in you, has resolved to appear at\r\nthe Winter Palace at two o\u0027clock in the afternoon, in order to inform\r\nyou of its needs. If you hesitate, and do not appear before the people,\r\nthen you tear the moral bonds between you and them. Trust in you will\r\ndisappear, because innocent blood will flow. Appear to-morrow before\r\nyour people and receive our address of devotion in a courageous spirit!\r\nI and the labour representatives, my brave comrades, guarantee the\r\ninviolability of your person.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGapon was no longer merely the president of the Workmen\u0027s Union:\r\ninebriated with the excitement he had done so much to create, he now\r\nimagined himself the representative of the oppressed Russian people, and\r\nthe heroic leader of a great political revolution. In the petition\r\nwhich he had prepared he said little about the grievances of the St.\r\nPetersburg workmen whose interests he had a right to advocate, and\r\npreferred to soar into much higher regions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The bureaucracy has brought the country to the verge of ruin, and, by\r\na shameful war, is bringing it to its downfall. We have no voice in the\r\nheavy burdens imposed on us; we do not even know for whom or why this\r\nmoney is wrung from the impoverished people, and we do not know how it\r\nis expended. This state of things is contrary to the Divine laws, and\r\nrenders life unbearable. Assembled before your palace, we plead for our\r\nsalvation. Refuse not your aid; raise your people from the tomb, and\r\ngive them the means of working out their own destiny. Rescue them from\r\nthe intolerable yoke of officialdom; throw down the wall that separates\r\nyou from them, in order that they may rule with you the country that was\r\ncreated for their happiness--a happiness which is being wrenched from\r\nus, leaving nothing but sorrow and humiliation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an innate sentiment of autocratic dignity the Emperor declined\r\nto obey the imperious summons, and he thereby avoided an unseemly\r\naltercation with the excited priest, as well as the boisterous public\r\nmeetings which the Social Democrats were preparing to hold in the Palace\r\nSquare. Orders were given to the police and the troops to prevent the\r\ncrowds of workmen from penetrating into the centre of the city from the\r\nindustrial suburbs. The rest need not be described in detail. On Sunday\r\nthe crowds tried to force their way, the troops fired, and many of the\r\ndemonstrators were killed or wounded. How many it is impossible to say;\r\nbetween the various estimates there is an enormous discrepancy. At one\r\nof the first volleys Father Gapon fell, but he turned out to be quite\r\nunhurt, and was spirited away to his place of refuge, whence he escaped\r\nacross the frontier.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had an opportunity of giving public expression to his\r\nfeelings, he indulged in very strong language. In his letters and\r\nproclamations the Tsar is called a miscreant and an assassin, and is\r\ndescribed as traitorous, bloodthirsty, and bestial. To the ministers\r\nhe is equally uncomplimentary. They appear to him an accursed band of\r\nbrigands, Mamelukes, jackals, monsters. Against the Tsar, \"with his\r\nreptilian brood,\" and the ministers alike, he vows vengeance--\"death\r\nto them all!\" As for the means for realising his sacred mission, he\r\nrecommends bombs, dynamite, individual and wholesale terrorism, popular\r\ninsurrection, and paralysing the life of the cities by destroying the\r\nwater-mains, the gas-pipes, the telegraph and telephone wires, the\r\nrailways and tram-ways, the Government buildings and the prisons. At\r\nsome moments he seems to imagine himself invested with papal powers, for\r\nhe anathematises the soldiers who did their duty on the eventful day,\r\nwhilst he blesses and absolves from their oath of allegiance those who\r\nhelp the nation to win liberty.\r\n\r\nSo far I have spoken merely of the main currents in the revolutionary\r\nmovement. Of the minor currents--particularly those in the outlying\r\nprovinces, where the Socialist tendencies were mingled with nationalist\r\nfeeling--I shall have occasion to speak when I come to deal with the\r\npresent political situation as a whole. Meanwhile, I wish to sketch in\r\noutline the foreign policy which has powerfully contributed to bring\r\nabout the present crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTERRITORIAL EXPANSION AND FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nRapid Growth of Russia--Expansive Tendency of Agricultural Peoples--The\r\nRusso-Slavonians--The Northern Forest and the Steppe--Colonisation--The\r\nPart of the Government in the Process of Expansion--Expansion towards\r\nthe West--Growth of the Empire Represented in a Tabular Form--Commercial\r\nMotive for Expansion--The Expansive Force in the Future--Possibilities\r\nof Expansion in Europe--Persia, Afghanistan, and India--Trans-Siberian\r\nRailway and Weltpolitik--A Grandiose Scheme--Determined Opposition of\r\nJapan--Negotiations and War--Russia\u0027s Imprudence Explained--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of Russia is one of the most remarkable facts of modern\r\nhistory. An insignificant tribe, or collection of tribes, which, a\r\nthousand years ago, occupied a small district near the sources of\r\nthe Dnieper and Western Dvina, has grown into a great nation with a\r\nterritory stretching from the Baltic to the Northern Pacific, and from\r\nthe Polar Ocean to the frontiers of Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, and\r\nChina. We have here a fact well deserving of investigation, and as\r\nthe process is still going on and is commonly supposed to threaten our\r\nnational interests, the investigation ought to have for us more than a\r\nmere scientific interest. What is the secret of this expansive power?\r\nIs it a mere barbarous lust of territorial aggrandisement, or is it\r\nsome more reasonable motive? And what is the nature of the process? Is\r\nannexation followed by assimilation, or do the new acquisitions retain\r\ntheir old character? Is the Empire in its present extent a homogeneous\r\nwhole, or merely a conglomeration of heterogenous units held together\r\nby the outward bond of centralised administration? If we could find\r\nsatisfactory answers to these questions, we might determine how far\r\nRussia is strengthened or weakened by her annexations of territory, and\r\nmight form some plausible conjectures as to how, when, and where the\r\nprocess of expansion is to stop.\r\n\r\nBy glancing at her history from the economic point of view we may easily\r\ndetect one prominent cause of expansion.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural people, employing merely the primitive methods of\r\nagriculture, has always a strong tendency to widen its borders.\r\nThe natural increase of population demands a constantly increasing\r\nproduction of grain, whilst the primitive methods of cultivation exhaust\r\nthe soil and steadily diminish its productivity. With regard to this\r\nstage of economic development, the modest assertion of Malthus, that\r\nthe supply of food does not increase so rapidly as the population, often\r\nfalls far short of the truth. As the population increases, the supply\r\nof food may decrease not only relatively, but absolutely. When a\r\npeople finds itself in this critical position, it must adopt one of two\r\nalternatives: either it must prevent the increase of population, or it\r\nmust increase the production of food. In the former case it may legalise\r\nthe custom of \"exposing\" infants, as was done in ancient Greece; or it\r\nmay regularly sell a large portion of the young women and children,\r\nas was done until recently in Circassia; or the surplus population\r\nmay emigrate to foreign lands, as the Scandinavians did in the ninth\r\ncentury, and as we ourselves are doing in a more peaceable fashion\r\nat the present day. The other alternative may be effected either\r\nby extending the area of cultivation or by improving the system of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Slavonians, being an agricultural people, experienced this\r\ndifficulty, but for them it was not serious. A convenient way of escape\r\nwas plainly indicated by their peculiar geographical position. They\r\nwere not hemmed in by lofty mountains or stormy seas. To the south and\r\neast--at their very doors, as it were--lay a boundless expanse of thinly\r\npopulated virgin soil, awaiting the labour of the husbandman, and ready\r\nto repay it most liberally. The peasantry therefore, instead of exposing\r\ntheir infants, selling their daughters, or sweeping the seas as Vikings,\r\nsimply spread out towards the east and south. This was at once the most\r\nnatural and the wisest course, for of all the expedients for preserving\r\nthe equilibrium between population and food-production, increasing the\r\narea of cultivation is, under the circumstances just described, the\r\neasiest and most effective. Theoretically the same result might have\r\nbeen obtained by improving the method of agriculture, but practically\r\nthis was impossible. Intensive culture is not likely to be adopted so\r\nlong as expansion is easy. High farming is a thing to be proud of when\r\nthere is a scarcity of land, but it would be absurd to attempt it where\r\nthere is abundance of virgin soil in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe process of expansion, thus produced by purely economic causes,\r\nwas accelerated by influences of another kind, especially during the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The increase in the number of\r\nofficials, the augmentation of the taxes, the merciless exactions of the\r\nVoyevods and their subordinates, the transformation of the peasants\r\nand \"free wandering people\" into serfs, the ecclesiastical reforms and\r\nconsequent persecution of the schismatics, the frequent conscriptions\r\nand violent reforms of Peter the Great--these and other kinds of\r\noppression made thousands flee from their homes and seek a refuge in the\r\nfree territory, where there were no officials, no tax-gatherers, and\r\nno proprietors. But the State, with its army of tax-gatherers and\r\nofficials, followed close on the heels of the fugitives, and those\r\nwho wished to preserve their liberty had to advance still further.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of the authorities to retain the population\r\nin the localities actually occupied, the wave of colonisation moved\r\nsteadily onwards.\r\n\r\nThe vast territory which lay open to the colonists consisted of two\r\ncontiguous regions, separated from each other by no mountains or\r\nrivers, but widely differing from each other in many respects. The one,\r\ncomprising all the northern part of Eastern Europe and of Asia,\r\neven unto Kamchatka, may be roughly described as a land of forests,\r\nintersected by many rivers, and containing numerous lakes and marshes;\r\nthe other, stretching southwards to the Black Sea, and eastwards far\r\naway into Central Asia, is for the most part what Russians call \"the\r\nSteppe,\" and Americans would call the prairies.\r\n\r\nEach of these two regions presented peculiar inducements and peculiar\r\nobstacles to colonisation. So far as the facility of raising grain was\r\nconcerned, the southern region was decidedly preferable. In the north\r\nthe soil had little natural fertility, and was covered with dense\r\nforests, so that much time and labour had to be expended in making a\r\nclearing before the seed could be sown.* In the south, on the contrary,\r\nthe squatter had no trees to fell, and no clearing to make. Nature had\r\ncleared the land for him, and supplied him with a rich black soil of\r\nmarvellous fertility, which has not yet been exhausted by centuries\r\nof cultivation. Why, then, did the peasant often prefer the northern\r\nforests to the fertile Steppe where the land was already prepared for\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n     * The modus operandi has been already described; vide supra,\r\n     pp. 104 et seq.\r\n\r\nFor this apparent inconsistency there was a good and valid reason. The\r\nmuzhik had not, even in those good old times, any passionate love of\r\nlabour for its own sake, nor was he by any means insensible to the\r\nfacilities for agriculture afforded by the Steppe. But he could not\r\nregard the subject exclusively from the agricultural point of view. He\r\nhad to take into consideration the fauna as well as the flora of the\r\ntwo regions. At the head of the fauna in the northern forests stood\r\nthe peace-loving, laborious Finnish tribes, little disposed to molest\r\nsettlers who did not make themselves obnoxiously aggressive; on the\r\nSteppe lived the predatory, nomadic hordes, ever ready to attack,\r\nplunder, and carry off as slaves the peaceful agricultural population.\r\nThese facts, as well as the agricultural conditions, were known to\r\nintending colonists, and influenced them in their choice of a new home.\r\nThough generally fearless and fatalistic in a higher degree, they\r\ncould not entirely overlook the dangers of the Steppe, and many of them\r\npreferred to encounter the hard work of the forest region.\r\n\r\nThese differences in the character and population of the two regions\r\ndetermined the character of the colonisation. Though the colonisation\r\nof the northern regions was not effected entirely without bloodshed, it\r\nwas, on the whole, of a peaceful kind, and consequently received little\r\nattention from the contemporary chroniclers. The colonisation of the\r\nSteppe, on the contrary, required the help of the Cossacks, and forms,\r\nas I have already shown, one of the bloodiest pages of European history.\r\n\r\nThus, we see, the process of expansion towards the north, east, and\r\nsouth may be described as a spontaneous movement of the agricultural\r\npopulation. It must, however, be admitted that this is an imperfect\r\nand one-sided representation of the phenomenon. Though the initiative\r\nunquestionably came from the people, the Government played an important\r\npart in the movement.\r\n\r\nIn early times when Russia was merely a conglomeration of independent\r\nprincipalities, the Princes were under the moral and political\r\nobligation of protecting their subjects, and this obligation coincided\r\nadmirably with their natural desire to extend their dominions. When the\r\nGrand Princes of Muscovy, in the fifteenth century, united the numerous\r\nprincipalities and proclaimed themselves Tsars, they accepted this\r\nobligation for the whole country, and conceived much grander schemes of\r\nterritorial aggrandisement. Towards the north and northeast no strenuous\r\nefforts were required. The Republic of Novgorod easily gained possession\r\nof Northern Russia as far as the Ural Mountains, and Siberia was\r\nconquered by a small band of Cossacks without the authorisation of\r\nMuscovy, so that the Tsars had merely to annex the already conquered\r\nterritory. In the southern region the part played by the Government\r\nwas very different. The agricultural population had to be constantly\r\nprotected along a frontier of enormous length, lying open at all points\r\nto the incursions of nomadic tribes. To prevent raids it was necessary\r\nto keep up a military cordon, and this means did not always ensure\r\nprotection to those living near the frontier. The nomads often came in\r\nformidable hordes, which could be successfully resisted only by large\r\narmies, and sometimes the armies were not large enough to cope with\r\nthem. Again and again during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\r\nTartar hordes swept over the country--burning the villages and towns,\r\nand spreading devastation wherever they appeared--and during more than\r\ntwo centuries Russia had to pay a heavy tribute to the Khans.\r\n\r\nGradually the Tsars threw off this galling yoke. Ivan the Terrible\r\nannexed the three Khanates of the Lower Volga--Kazan, Kipttchak, and\r\nAstrakhan--and in that way removed the danger of a foreign domination.\r\nBut permanent protection was not thereby secured to the outlying\r\nprovinces. The nomadic tribes living near the frontier continued their\r\nraids, and in the slave markets of the Crimea the living merchandise was\r\nsupplied by Russia and Poland.\r\n\r\nTo protect an open frontier against the incursions of nomadic tribes\r\nthree methods are possible: the construction of a great wall, the\r\nestablishment of a strong military cordon, and the permanent subjugation\r\nof the marauders. The first of these expedients, adopted by the Romans\r\nin Britain and by the Chinese on their northwestern frontier, is\r\nenormously expensive, and was utterly impossible in a country like\r\nSouthern Russia, where there is no stone for building purposes; the\r\nsecond was constantly tried, and constantly found wanting; the third\r\nalone proved practicable and efficient. Though the Government has\r\nlong since recognised that the acquisition of barren, thinly populated\r\nsteppes is a burden rather than an advantage, it has been induced to go\r\non making annexations for the purpose of self-defence, as well as for\r\nother reasons.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this active part which the Government took in the\r\nextension of the territory, the process of political expansion sometimes\r\ngot greatly ahead of the colonisation. After the Turkish wars and\r\nconsequent annexations in the time of Catherine II., for example, a\r\ngreat part of Southern Russia was almost uninhabited, and the deficiency\r\nhad to be corrected, as we have seen, by organised emigration. At the\r\npresent day, in the Asiatic provinces, there are still immense tracts of\r\nunoccupied land, some of which are being gradually colonised.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now from the East to the West we shall find that the\r\nexpansion in this direction was of an entirely different kind. The\r\ncountry lying to the westward of the early Russo-Slavonian settlements\r\nhad a poor soil and a comparatively dense population, and consequently\r\nheld out little inducement to emigration. Besides this, it was inhabited\r\nby warlike agricultural races, who were not only capable of defending\r\ntheir own territory, but even strongly disposed to make encroachments\r\non their eastern neighbours. Russian expansion to the westward was,\r\ntherefore, not a spontaneous movement of the agricultural population,\r\nbut the work of the Government, acting slowly and laboriously by means\r\nof diplomacy and military force; it had, however, a certain historical\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Russia freed herself, in the fifteenth century, from\r\nthe Tartar domination, than her political independence, and even\r\nher national existence, were threatened from the West. Her western\r\nneighbours, were like herself, animated with that tendency to national\r\nexpansion which I have above described; and for a time it seemed\r\ndoubtful who should ultimately possess the vast plains of Eastern\r\nEurope. The chief competitors were the Tsars of Moscow and the Kings\r\nof Poland, and the latter appeared to have the better chance. In close\r\nconnection with Western Europe, they had been able to adopt many of the\r\nimprovements which had recently been made in the art of war, and they\r\nalready possessed the rich valley of the Dnieper. Once, with the help of\r\nthe free Cossacks, they succeeded in overrunning the whole of Muscovy,\r\nand a son of the Polish king was elected Tsar in Moscow. By attempting\r\nto accomplish their purpose in a too hasty and reckless fashion, they\r\nraised a storm of religious and patriotic fanaticism, which very\r\nsoon drove them out of their newly acquired possessions. The country\r\nremained, however, in a very precarious position, and its more\r\nintelligent rulers perceived plainly that, in order to carry on the\r\nstruggle successfully, they must import something of that Western\r\ncivilisation which gave such an advantage to their opponents.\r\n\r\nSome steps had already been taken in that direction. In the year 1553 an\r\nEnglish navigator, whilst seeking for a short route to China and India,\r\nhad accidentally discovered the port of Archangel on the White Sea, and\r\nsince that time the Tsars had kept up an intermittent diplomatic and\r\ncommercial intercourse with England. But this route was at all times\r\ntedious and dangerous, and during a great part of the year it was closed\r\nby the ice. In view of these difficulties the Tsars tried to import\r\n\"cunning foreign artificers,\" by way of the Baltic; but their efforts\r\nwere hampered by the Livonian Order, who at that time held the east\r\ncoast, and who considered, like the Europeans on the coast of Africa at\r\nthe present day, that the barbarous natives of the interior should not\r\nbe supplied with arms and ammunition. All the other routes to the West\r\ntraversed likewise the territory of rivals, who might at any time become\r\navowed enemies. Under these circumstances the Tsars naturally desired to\r\nbreak through the barrier which hemmed them in, and the acquisition\r\nof the eastern coast of the Baltic became one of the chief objects of\r\nRussia\u0027s foreign policy.\r\n\r\nAfter Poland, Russia\u0027s most formidable rival was Sweden. That\r\npower early acquired a large amount of territory to the east of the\r\nBaltic--including the mouths of the Neva, where St. Petersburg now\r\nstands--and long harboured ambitious schemes of further conquest. In the\r\ntroublous times when the Poles overran the Tsardom of Muscovy, she took\r\nadvantage of the occasion to annex a considerable amount of territory,\r\nand her expansion in this direction went on in intermittent fashion\r\nuntil it was finally stopped by Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with these two rivals Russia was weak in all that regarded\r\nthe art of war; but she had two immense advantages: she had a very large\r\npopulation, and a strong, stable Government that could concentrate the\r\nnational forces for any definite purpose. All that she required for\r\nsuccess in the competition was an army on the European model. Peter the\r\nGreat created such an army, and won the prize. After this the political\r\ndisintegration of Poland proceeded rapidly, and when that unhappy\r\ncountry fell to pieces Russia naturally took for herself the lion\u0027s\r\nshare of the spoil. Sweden, too, sank to political insignificance, and\r\ngradually lost all her trans-Baltic possessions. The last of them--the\r\nGrand Duchy of Finland, which stretches from the Gulf of Finland to\r\nthe Polar Ocean--was ceded to Russia by the peace of Friederichshamm in\r\n1809.\r\n\r\nThe territorial extent of all these acquisitions will be best shown in\r\na tabular form. The following table represents the process of expansion\r\nfrom the time when Ivan III. united the independent principalities and\r\nthrew off the Tartar yoke, down to the accession of Peter the Great in\r\n1682:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                      English\r\n                                                    Sq. Miles.\r\n     In 1505 the Tsardom of Muscovy contained about    784,000\r\n      \" 1583        \"          \"       \"        \"      996,000\r\n      \" 1584        \"          \"       \"        \"    2,650,000\r\n      \" 1598        \"          \"       \"        \"    3,328,000\r\n      \" 1676        \"          \"       \"        \"    5,448,000\r\n      \" 1682        \"          \"       \"        \"    5,618,000\r\n\r\nOf these 5,618,000 English square miles about 1,696,000 were in Europe\r\nand about 3,922,000 in Asia. Peter the Great, though famous as a\r\nconqueror, did not annex nearly so much territory as many of his\r\npredecessors and successors. At his death, in 1752, the Empire\r\ncontained, in round numbers, 1,738,000 square miles in Europe and\r\n4,092,000 in Asia. The following table shows the subsequent expansion:\r\n\r\n                                In Europe and the Caucasus   In Asia.\r\n                                              Eng. sq. m   Eng. sq. m.\r\n    In 1725 the Russian Empire contained about 1,738,000    4,092,000\r\n     \" 1770        \"       \"       \"       \"   1,780,000    4,452,000\r\n     \" 1800        \"       \"       \"       \"   2,014,000    4,452,000\r\n     \" 1825        \"       \"       \"       \"   2,226,000    4,452,000\r\n     \" 1855        \"       \"       \"       \"   2,261,250    5,194,000\r\n     \" 1867        \"       \"       \"       \"   2,267,360    5,267,560\r\n     \" 1897        \"       \"       \"       \"   2,267,360    6,382,321\r\n\r\nIn this table is not included the territory in the North-west of\r\nAmerica--containing about 513,250 English square miles--which was\r\nannexed to Russia in 1799 and ceded to the United States in 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen once Russia has annexed she does not readily relax her grasp. She\r\nhas, however, since the death of Peter the Great, on four occasions\r\nceded territory which had come into her possession. To Persia she ceded,\r\nin 1729, Mazanderan and Astrabad, and in 1735 a large portion of the\r\nCaucasus; in 1856, by the Treaty of Paris, she gave up the mouths of the\r\nDanube and part of Bessarabia; in 1867 she sold to the United States her\r\nAmerican possessions; in 1881 she retroceded to China the greater\r\npart of Kuldja, which she had occupied for ten years; and now she is\r\nreleasing her hold on Manchuria under the pressure of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the population--due in part to territorial\r\nacquisitions--since 1722, when the first census was taken, has been as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     In 1722 the Empire contained about 14 million inhabitants.\r\n     \" 1742       \"       \"       \"    16        \"\r\n     \" 1762       \"       \"       \"    19        \"\r\n     \" 1782       \"       \"       \"    28        \"\r\n     \" 1796       \"       \"       \"    36        \"\r\n     \" 1812       \"       \"       \"    41        \"\r\n     \" 1815       \"       \"       \"    45        \"\r\n     \" 1835       \"       \"       \"    60        \"\r\n     \" 1851       \"       \"       \"    68        \"\r\n     \" 1858       \"       \"       \"    44        \"\r\n     \" 1897       \"       \"       \"   129        \"\r\n\r\nSo much for the past. To sum up, we may say that, if we have read\r\nRussian history aright, the chief motives of expansion have been\r\nspontaneous colonisation, self-defence against nomadic tribes, and high\r\npolitical aims, such as the desire to reach the sea-coast; and that the\r\nprocess has been greatly facilitated by peculiar geographical conditions\r\nand the autocratic form of government. Before passing to the future,\r\nI must mention another cause of expansion which has recently come into\r\nplay, and which has already acquired very great importance.\r\n\r\nRussia is rapidly becoming, as I have explained in a previous chapter,\r\na great industrial and commercial nation, and is anxious to acquire new\r\nmarkets for her manufactured goods. Though her industries cannot yet\r\nsupply her own wants, she likes to peg out claims for the future, so as\r\nnot to be forestalled by more advanced nations. I am not sure that she\r\never makes a conquest exclusively for this purpose, but whenever it\r\nhappens that she has other reasons for widening her borders, the idea of\r\nacquiring commercial advantages acts as a subsidiary incentive, and\r\nas soon as the territory is annexed she raises round it a line of\r\ncommercial fortifications in the shape of custom-houses, through which\r\nforeign goods have great difficulty in forcing their way.\r\n\r\nThis policy is quite intelligible from the patriotic point of view, but\r\nRussians like to justify it, and condemn English competition, on higher\r\nground. England, they say, is like a successful manufacturer who has\r\noustripped his rivals and who seeks to prevent any new competitors from\r\ncoming into the field. By her mercantile policy she has become the great\r\nblood-sucker of other nations. Having no cause to fear competition, she\r\nadvocates the insidious principles of Free Trade, and deluges foreign\r\ncountries with her manufactures to such an extent that unprotected\r\nnative industries are inevitably ruined. Thus all nations have long\r\npaid tribute to England, but the era of emancipation had dawned. The\r\nfallacies of Free Trade have been detected and exposed, and Russia, like\r\nother nations, has found in the beneficent power of protective tariffs a\r\nmeans of escape from British economic thraldom. Henceforth, not only the\r\nmuzhiks of European Russia, but also the populations of Central\r\nAsia, will be saved from the heartless exploitation of Manchester and\r\nBirmingham--and be handed over, I presume, to the tender mercies of the\r\nmanufacturers of Moscow and St. Petersburg, who sell their goods much\r\ndearer than their English rivals.\r\n\r\nHaving thus analysed the expansive tendency, let us endeavour to\r\ndetermine how the various factors of which it is composed are acting in\r\nthe present and are likely to act in the future. In this investigation\r\nit will be well to begin with the simpler, and proceed gradually to the\r\nmore complex parts of the problem.\r\n\r\nTowards the north and the west the history of Russian expansion may\r\nalmost be regarded as closed. Northwards there is nothing to be annexed\r\nbut the Arctic Ocean and the Polar regions; and, westwards, annexations\r\nat the expense of Germany are not to be thought of. There remain,\r\ntherefore, only Sweden and Norway. They may possibly, at some future\r\ntime, come within the range of Russia\u0027s territorial appetite, but at\r\npresent the only part of the Scandinavian Peninsula on which she is\r\nsupposed to cast longing eyes is a barren district in the extreme north,\r\nwhich is said to contain an excellent warm-water port.\r\n\r\nTowards the south-west there are possibilities of future expansion, and\r\nalready some people talk of Austrian Galicia being geographically and\r\nethnographically a part of Russia; but so long as the Austro-Hungarian\r\nEmpire holds together such possibilities do not come within the sphere\r\nof practical politics.\r\n\r\nFarther east, towards the Balkan Peninsula, the expansive tendency is\r\nmuch more complicated and of very ancient date. The Russo-Slavs who\r\nheld the valley of the Dnieper from the ninth to the thirteenth century\r\nbelonged to those numerous frontier tribes which the tottering Byzantine\r\nEmpires attempted to ward off by diplomacy and rich gifts, and by giving\r\nto the troublesome chiefs, on condition of their accepting Christianity,\r\nprincesses of the Imperial family as brides. Vladimir, Prince of Kief,\r\nnow recognised as a Saint by the Russian Church, accepted Christianity\r\nin this way (A. D. 988), and his subjects followed his example.\r\nRussia thus became ecclesiastically a part of the Patriarchate of\r\nConstantinople, and the people learned to regard Tsargrad--that is,\r\nthe City of the Tsar, as the Byzantine Emperor was then called--with\r\npeculiar veneration.\r\n\r\nAll through the long Tartar domination, when the nomadic hordes held the\r\nvalley of the Dnieper and formed a barrier between Russia and the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, the capital of the Greek Orthodox world was remembered\r\nand venerated by the Russian people, and in the fifteenth century it\r\nacquired in their eyes a new significance. At that time the relative\r\npositions of Constantinople and Moscow were changed. Constantinople fell\r\nunder the power of the Mahometan Turks, whilst Moscow threw off the yoke\r\nof the Mahometan Tartars, the northern representatives of the Turkish\r\nrace. The Grand Prince of Moscow thereby became the Protector of\r\nthe Faith, and in some sort the successor of the Byzantine Tsars. To\r\nstrengthen this claim, Ivan III. married a niece of the last Byzantine\r\nEmperor, and his successors went further in the same direction by\r\nassuming the title of Tsar, and inventing a fable about their ancestor\r\nRurik having been a descendant of Caesar Augustus.\r\n\r\nAll this would seem to a lawyer, or even to a diplomatist, a very\r\nshadowy title, and none of the Russian monarchs--except perhaps\r\nCatherine II., who conceived the project of resuscitating the Byzantine\r\nEmpire, and caused one of her grandsons to learn modern Greek, in\r\nview of possible contingencies--ever thought seriously of claiming\r\nthe imaginary heritage; but the idea that the Tsars ought to reign in\r\nTsargrad, and that St. Sophia, polluted by Moslem abominations, should\r\nbe restored to the Orthodox Christians, struck deep root in the minds of\r\nthe Russian people, and is still by no means extinct. As soon as serious\r\ndisturbances break out in the East the peasantry begin to think that\r\nperhaps the time has come for undertaking a crusade for the recovery of\r\nthe Holy City on the Bosphorus, and for the liberation of their brethren\r\nin the faith who groan under Turkish bondage.\r\n\r\nEssentially different from this religious sentiment, but often blended\r\nwith it, is a vague feeling of racial affinity, which has long existed\r\namong the various Slav nationalities, and which was greatly developed\r\nduring last century by writers of the Panslavist school. When Germans\r\nand Italians were striving after political independence and unity, it\r\nnaturally occurred to the Slavs that they might do likewise. The idea\r\nbecame popular among the subject Slav nationalities of Austria and\r\nTurkey, and it awoke a certain amount of enthusiasm in Moscow, where it\r\nwas hoped that \"all the Slav streams would unite in the great Russian\r\nSea.\" It required no great political perspicacity to foresee that in\r\nany confederation of Slav nationalities the hegemony must necessarily\r\ndevolve on Russia, the only Slav State which has succeeded in becoming a\r\nGreat Power.\r\n\r\nThose two currents of national feeling ran parallel to, and intermingled\r\nwith, the policy of the Government. Desirous of becoming a great naval\r\nPower, Russia has always striven to reach the sea-coast and obtain good\r\nharbours. In the north and north-west she succeeded in a certain degree,\r\nbut neither the White Sea nor the Baltic satisfied her requirements, and\r\nshe naturally turned her eyes to the Mediterranean. With difficulty\r\nshe gained possession of the northern shores of the Black Sea, but her\r\ndesigns were thereby only half realised, because the Turks held the only\r\noutlet to the Mediterranean, and could effectually blockade, so far as\r\nthe open sea is concerned, all her Black Sea ports, without employing\r\na single ship of war. Thus the possession of the Straits, involving\r\nnecessarily the possession of Constantinople, became a cardinal point of\r\nRussia\u0027s foreign policy. Any description of the various methods adopted\r\nby her at different times for the attainment of this end does not enter\r\ninto my present programme, but I may say briefly that the action of the\r\nthree factors above mentioned--the religious feeling, the Panslavist\r\nsentiment, and the political aims--has never been better exemplified\r\nthan in the last struggle with Turkey, culminating in the Treaty of San\r\nStefano and the Congress of Berlin.\r\n\r\nFor all classes in Russia the result of that struggle was a feeling\r\nof profound disappointment. The peasantry bewailed the fact that the\r\nCrescent on St. Sophia had not been replaced by the Cross; the Slavophil\r\npatriots were indignant that the \"little brothers\" had shown themselves\r\nunworthy of the generous efforts and sacrifices made on their behalf,\r\nand that a portion of the future Slav confederation had passed under\r\nthe domination of Austria; and the Government recognised that the\r\nacquisition of the Straits must be indefinitely postponed. Then history\r\nrepeated itself. After the Crimean War, in accordance with Prince\r\nGortchakoff\u0027s famous epigram, La Russie ne boude pas elle se recueille,\r\nthe Government had for some years abandoned an active policy in Europe,\r\nand devoted itself to the work of internal reorganisation; whilst the\r\nmilitary party had turned their attention to making new acquisitions\r\nof territory and influence in Asia. In like manner, after the Turkish\r\ncampaign of 1877-78, Alexander III., turning his back on the Slav\r\nbrethren, inaugurated an era of peace in Europe and of territorial\r\nexpansion in the east. In this direction the expansive force was\r\nnot affected by religious feeling, or Panslavist sentiment, and\r\nwas controlled and guided by purely political considerations. It is\r\nconsequently much easier to determine in this field of action what the\r\npolitical aims really are.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, as in Europe, the dominant factor in the policy of the\r\nGovernment has been the desire to reach the sea-coast; and in both\r\ncontinents the ports first acquired were in northern latitudes where\r\nthe coasts are free from ice during only a part of the year. In this\r\nrespect, Nikolaefsk and Vladivostok in the Far East correspond to\r\nArchangel and St. Petersburg in Europe. Such ports could not fulfil\r\nall the requirements, and consequently the expansive tendency turned\r\nsouthwards--in Europe towards the Black Sea and the Mediterranean,\r\nand in Asia towards the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of\r\nPechili.\r\n\r\nIn Persia the Russian Government pursues the policy of pacific\r\ninfiltration, and already the northern half of the Shah\u0027s dominions is\r\npretty well permeated with Russian influence, commercial and political.\r\nIn the southern half the infiltration is to some extent checked by\r\nphysical obstacles and British influence, but it is steadily advancing,\r\nand the idea of obtaining a port on the Persian Gulf is coming within\r\nthe range of practical politics.\r\n\r\nIn Afghanistan also the pressure is felt, and here too the expansive\r\ntendency meets with opposition from England. More than once the two\r\ngreat Powers have come dangerously near to war--notably in 1885, at\r\nthe moment of the Penjdeh incident, when the British Parliament voted\r\n11,000,000 pounds for military preparations. Fortunately on that\r\noccasion the problem was solved by diplomacy. The northern frontier of\r\nAfghanistan was demarcated by a joint commission, and an agreement was\r\ncome to by which this line should form the boundary of the British\r\nand Russian spheres of influence. For some years Russia scrupulously\r\nrespected this agreement, but during our South African difficulties\r\nshe showed symptoms of departing from it, and at one moment orders were\r\nissued from St. Petersburg for a military demonstration on the Afghan\r\nfrontier. Strange to say, the military authorities, who are usually very\r\nbellicose, deprecated such a movement, on the ground that a military\r\ndemonstration in a country like Afghanistan might easily develop into a\r\nserious campaign, and that a serious campaign ought not to be undertaken\r\nin that region until after the completion of the strategical railways\r\nfrom Orenburg to Tashkent.\r\n\r\nAs this important line has now been completed, and other strategic lines\r\nare in contemplation, the question arises whether Russia meditates an\r\nattack on India. It is a question which is not easily answered. No doubt\r\nthere are many Russians who think it would be a grand thing to annex\r\nour Indian Empire, with its teeming millions and its imaginary fabulous\r\ntreasures, and not a few young officers imagine that it would be an easy\r\ntask. Further, it is certain that the problem of an invasion has been\r\nstudied by the Headquarters Staff in St. Petersburg, just as the problem\r\nof an invasion of England has been studied by the Headquarters Staff in\r\nBerlin. It may be pretty safely asserted, however, that the idea of a\r\nconquest of India has never been seriously entertained in the Russian\r\nofficial world. What has been seriously entertained, not only in the\r\nofficial world, but by the Government itself, is the idea--strongly\r\nrecommended by the late General Skobelef--that Russia should, as quickly\r\nas possible, get within striking distance of our Indian possessions, so\r\nthat she may always be able to bring strong diplomatic pressure on the\r\nBritish Government, and in the event of a conflict immobilise a large\r\npart of the British army.\r\n\r\nThe expansive tendency in the direction of the Persian Gulf and\r\nthe Indian Ocean was considerably weakened by the completion of the\r\nTrans-Siberian Railway and the rapid development of an aggressive policy\r\nin the Far east. Never, perhaps, has the construction of a single line\r\nproduced such deep and lasting changes in the sphere of Weltpolitik.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Trans-Siberian was being rapidly constructed a\r\nmagnificent prospect opened up to the gaze of imaginative politicians in\r\nSt. Petersburg. The foreground was Manchuria a region of 364,000 square\r\nmiles, endowed by nature with enormous mineral resources, and\r\npresenting a splendid field for agricultural colonisation and commercial\r\nenterprise. Beyond was seen Korea, geographically an appendix of\r\nManchuria, possessing splendid harbours, and occupied by an effete,\r\nunwarlike population, wholly incapable of resisting a European Power.\r\nThat was quite enough to inflame the imagination of patriotic Russians;\r\nbut there was something more, dimly perceived in the background. Once\r\nin possession of Manchuria, supplied with a network of railways, Russia\r\nwould dominate Peking and the whole of Northern China, and she would\r\nthus be able to play a decisive part in the approaching struggle of the\r\nEuropean Powers for the Far-Eastern Sick Man\u0027s inheritance.\r\n\r\nOf course there were obstacles in the way of realising this grandiose\r\nscheme, and there were some cool heads in St. Petersburg who were not\r\nslow to point them out. In the first place the undertaking must be\r\nextremely costly, and the economic condition of Russia proper was not\r\nsuch as to justify the expenditure of an enormous capital which must be\r\nfor many years unproductive. Any superfluous capital which the country\r\nmight possess was much more urgently required for purposes of internal\r\ndevelopment, and the impoverished agricultural population ought not\r\nto be drained of their last meagre reserves for the sake of gigantic\r\npolitical schemes which did not directly contribute to their material\r\nwelfare. To this the enthusiastic advocates of the forward policy\r\nreplied that the national finances had never been in such a prosperous\r\ncondition, that the revenue was increasing by leaps and bounds, that\r\nthe money invested in the proposed enterprise would soon be repaid with\r\ninterest; and that if Russia did not at once seize the opportunity she\r\nwould find herself forestalled by energetic rivals. There was still,\r\nhowever, one formidable objection. Such an enormous increase of\r\nRussia\u0027s power in the Far East would inevitably arouse the jealousy and\r\nopposition of other Powers, especially of Japan, for whom the future of\r\nKorea and Manchuria was a question of life and death. Here again these\r\nadvocates of the forward policy had their answer ready. They declared\r\nthat the danger was more apparent than real. In Far-Eastern diplomacy\r\nthe European Powers could not compete with Russia, and they might easily\r\nbe bought off by giving them a very modest share of the spoil; as for\r\nJapan, she was not formidable, for she was just emerging from Oriental\r\nbarbarism, and all her boasted progress was nothing more than a thin\r\nveneer of European civilisation. As the Moscow patriots on the eve of\r\nthe Crimean War said contemptuously of the Allies, \"We have only to\r\nthrow our hats at them,\" so now the believers in Russia\u0027s historic\r\nmission in the Far East spoke of their future opponents as \"monkeys\" and\r\n\"parrots.\"\r\n\r\nThe war between China and Japan in 1894-5, terminating in the Treaty of\r\nShimonoseki, which ceded to Japan the Liaotung Peninsula, showed Russia\r\nthat if she was not to be forestalled she must be up and doing. She\r\naccordingly formed a coalition with France and Germany, and compelled\r\nJapan to withdraw from the mainland, on the pretext that the integrity\r\nof China must be maintained. In this way China recovered, for a moment,\r\na bit of lost territory, and further benefits were conferred on her by\r\na guarantee for a foreign loan, and by the creation of the Russo-Chinese\r\nBank, which would assist her in her financial affairs. For these and\r\nother favours she was expected to be grateful, and it was suggested\r\nto her that her gratitude might take the form of facilitating the\r\nconstruction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. If constructed wholly on\r\nRussian territory the line would have to make an enormous bend to the\r\nnorthward, whereas if it went straight from Lake Baikal to Vladivostok\r\nit would be very much shorter, and would confer a very great benefit\r\non the north-eastern provinces of the Celestial Empire. This benefit,\r\nmoreover, might be greatly increased by making a branch line to\r\nTalienwan and Port Arthur, which would some day be united with Peking.\r\nGradually Li-Hung-Chang and other influential Chinese officials were\r\ninduced to sympathise with the scheme, and a concession was granted for\r\nthe direct line to Vladivostok through Chinese territory.\r\n\r\nThe retrocession of the Liaotung Peninsula had not been effected by\r\nRussia alone. Germany and France had co-operated, and they also expected\r\nfrom China a mark of gratitude in some tangible form. On this point\r\nthe statesmen of Berlin held very strong views, and they thought it\r\nadvisable to obtain a material guarantee for the fulfilment of their\r\nexpectations by seizing Kiaochau, on the ground that German missionaries\r\nhad been murdered by Chinese fanatics.\r\n\r\nFor Russia this was a most unwelcome incident. She had earmarked\r\nKiaochau for her own purposes, and had already made an agreement with\r\nthe authorities in Peking that the harbour might be used freely by her\r\nfleet. And this was not the worst. The incident might inaugurate an era\r\nof partition for which she was not yet prepared, and another port which\r\nshe had earmarked for her own use might be seized by a rival. Already\r\nEnglish ships of war were reported to be prowling about in the vicinity\r\nof the Liaotung Peninsula. She hastened to demand, therefore, as a\r\nset-off for the loss of Kiaochau, a lease of Port Arthur and Talienwan,\r\nand a railway concession to unite these ports with the Trans-Siberian\r\nRailway. The Chinese Government was too weak to think of refusing the\r\ndemands, and the process of gradually absorbing Manchuria began, in\r\naccordance with a plan already roughly sketched out in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIn the light of a few authentic documents and many subsequent events,\r\nthe outline of this plan can be traced with tolerable accuracy. In the\r\nregion through which the projected railways were to run there was a\r\nlarge marauding population, and consequently the labourers and the\r\nworks would have to be protected; and as Chinese troops can never be\r\nthoroughly relied on, the protecting force must be Russian. Under\r\nthis rather transparent disguise a small army of occupation could be\r\ngradually introduced, and in establishing a modus vivendi between it and\r\nthe Chinese civil and military authorities a predominant influence in\r\nthe local administration could be established. At the same time, by\r\nenergetic diplomatic action at Peking, which would be brought within\r\nstriking-distance by the railways, all rival foreign influences might be\r\nexcluded from the occupied provinces, and the rest might be left to the\r\naction of \"spontaneous infiltration.\" Thus, while professing to uphold\r\nthe principle of the territorial integrity of the Celestial Empire, the\r\nCabinet of St. Petersburg might practically annex the whole of Manchuria\r\nand transform Port Arthur into a great naval port and arsenal, a far\r\nmore effectual \"Dominator of the East\" than Vladivostok, which was\r\nintended, as its name implies, to fulfil that function. From Manchuria\r\nthe political influence and the spontaneous infiltration would naturally\r\nextend to Korea, and on the deeply indented coast of the Hermit Kingdom\r\nnew ports and arsenals, far more spacious and strategically more\r\nimportant than Port Arthur, might be constructed.\r\n\r\nThe grandiose scheme was carefully laid, and for a time it was favoured\r\nby circumstances. In 1900 the Boxer troubles justified Russia in sending\r\na large force into Manchuria, and enabled her subsequently to play the\r\npart of China\u0027s protector against the inordinate demands of the Western\r\nPowers for compensation and guarantees. For a moment it seemed as if\r\nthe slow process of gradual infiltration might be replaced by a more\r\nexpeditious mode of annexation. As the dexterous diplomacy of Ignatief\r\nin 1858 had induced the Son of Heaven to cede to Russia the rich\r\nPrimorsk provinces between the Amur and the sea, as compensation for\r\nRussian protection against the English and French, who had burnt his\r\nSummer Palace, so his successor might now perhaps be induced to cede\r\nManchuria to the Tsar for similar reasons.\r\n\r\nNo such cession actually took place, but the Russian diplomatists in\r\nPeking could use the gratitude argument in support of their demands for\r\nan extension of the rights and privileges of the \"temporary\" occupation;\r\nand when China sought to resist the pressure by leaning on the rival\r\nPowers she found them to be little better than broken reeds. France\r\ncould not openly oppose her ally, and Germany had reasons of her own\r\nfor conciliating the Tsar, whilst England and the United States, though\r\navowedly opposing the scheme as dangerous to their commercial interests,\r\nwere not prepared to go to war in defence of their policy. It seemed,\r\ntherefore, that by patience, tenacity and diplomatic dexterity Russia\r\nmight ultimately attain her ends; but a surprise was in store for her.\r\nThere was one Power which recognised that her own vital interests were\r\nat stake, and which was ready to undertake a life-and-death struggle in\r\ndefence of them.\r\n\r\nThough still smarting under the humiliation of her expulsion from the\r\nLiaotung Peninsula in 1895, and watching with the keenest interest every\r\nmove in the political game, Japan had remained for some time in the\r\nbackground, and had confined her efforts to resisting Russian influence\r\nin Korea and supporting diplomatically the Powers who were upholding\r\nthe policy of the open door. Now, when it had become evident that the\r\nWestern Powers would not prevent the realisation of the Russian scheme,\r\nshe determined to intervene energetically, and to stake her national\r\nexistence on the result. Ever since 1895 she had been making military\r\nand naval preparations for the day of the revanche, and now that day was\r\nat hand. Against the danger of a coalition such as had checkmated her\r\non the previous occasion she was protected by the alliance which she had\r\nconcluded with England in 1902, and she felt confident that with Russia\r\nalone she was quite capable of dealing single-handed. Her position is\r\nbriefly and graphically described in a despatch, telegraphed at that\r\ntime (28th July, 1903) by the Japanese Government to its representative\r\nat St. Petersburg, instructing him to open negotiations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The recent conduct of Russia in making new demands at Peking and\r\ntightening her hold upon Manchuria has led the Imperial Government to\r\nbelieve that she must have abandoned her intention of retiring from\r\nthat province. At the same time, her increased activity upon the Korean\r\nfrontier is such as to raise doubts as to the limits of her ambition.\r\nThe unconditional and permanent occupation of Manchuria by Russia would\r\ncreate a state of things prejudicial to the security and interests of\r\nJapan. The principle of equal opportunity (the open door) would thereby\r\nbe annulled, and the territorial integrity of China impaired. There is,\r\nhowever, a still more serious consideration for the Japanese Government.\r\nIf Russia were established on the flank of Korea she would constantly\r\nmenace the separate existence of that Empire, or at least exercise in\r\nit a predominant influence; and as Japan considers Korea an important\r\noutpost in her line of defence, she regards its independence as\r\nabsolutely essential to her own repose and safety. Moreover, the\r\npolitical as well as commercial and industrial interests and influence\r\nwhich Japan possesses in Korea are paramount over those of other Powers;\r\nshe cannot, having regard to her own security, consent to surrender them\r\nto, or share them with, another Power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view of the situation the Japanese Government\r\ninformed Count Lamsdorff that, as it desired to remove from the\r\nrelations of the two Empires every cause of future misunderstanding,\r\nit would be glad to enter with the Imperial Russian Government upon an\r\nexamination of the condition of affairs in the Far East, with a view to\r\ndefining the respective special interests of the two countries in those\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThough Count Lamsdorff accepted the proposal with apparent cordiality\r\nand professed to regard it as a means of preventing any outsider from\r\nsowing the seeds of discord between the two countries, the idea of\r\na general discussion was not at all welcome. Careful definition of\r\nrespective interests was the last thing the Russian Government desired.\r\nIts policy was to keep the whole situation in a haze until it had\r\nconsolidated its position in Manchuria and on the Korean frontier\r\nto such an extent that it could dictate its own terms in any future\r\narrangement. It could not, however, consistently with its oft-repeated\r\ndeclarations of disinterestedness and love of peace, decline to discuss\r\nthe subject. It consented, therefore, to an exchange of views, but in\r\norder to ensure that the tightening of its hold on the territories in\r\nquestion should proceed pari passu with the diplomatic action, it made\r\nan extraordinary departure from ordinary procedure, entrusting the\r\nconduct of the affair, not to Count Lamsdorff and the Foreign Office,\r\nbut to Admiral Alexeyef, the newly created Viceroy of the Far East,\r\nin whom was vested the control of all civil, military, naval, and\r\ndiplomatic affairs relating to that part of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the negotiations, which lasted from August\r\n12th, 1903, to February 6th, 1904, the irreconcilable differences of the\r\ntwo rivals became apparent, and all through the correspondence, in\r\nwhich a few apparent concessions were offered by Japan, neither Power\r\nretreated a step from the positions originally taken up. What Japan\r\nsuggested was, roughly speaking, a mutual engagement to uphold the\r\nindependence and integrity of the Chinese and Korean empires, and at the\r\nsame time a bilateral arrangement by which the special interests of the\r\ntwo contracting parties in Manchuria and in Korea should be formally\r\nrecognised, and the means of protecting them clearly defined. The scheme\r\ndid not commend itself to the Russians. They systematically ignored the\r\ninterests of Japan in Manchuria, and maintained that she had no right\r\nto interfere in any arrangements they might think fit to make with the\r\nChinese Government with regard to that province. In their opinion, Japan\r\nought to recognise formally that Manchuria lay outside her sphere\r\nof interest, and the negotiations should be confined to limiting her\r\nfreedom of action in Korea.\r\n\r\nWith such a wide divergence in principle the two parties were not likely\r\nto agree in matters of detail. Their conflicting aims came out most\r\nclearly in the question of the open door. The Japanese insisted on\r\nobtaining the privileges of the open door, including the right of\r\nsettlement in Manchuria, and Russia obstinately refused. Having marked\r\nout Manchuria as a close reserve for her own colonisation, trade, and\r\nindustry, and knowing that she could not compete with the Japanese if\r\nthey were freely admitted, she could not adopt the principle of \"equal\r\nopportunity\" which her rivals recommended. A fidus achates of Admiral\r\nAlexeyef explained to me quite frankly, during the negotiations, why no\r\nconcessions could be made on that point. In the work of establishing\r\nlaw and order in Manchuria, constructing roads, bridges, railways, and\r\ntowns, Russia had expended an enormous sum--estimated by Count Cassini\r\nat 60,000,000 pounds--and until that capital was recovered, or until a\r\nreasonable interest was derived from the investment, Russia could not\r\nthink of sharing with any one the fruits of the prosperity which she had\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nWe need not go further into the details of the negotiations. Japan soon\r\nconvinced herself that the onward march of the Colossus was not to be\r\nstopped by paper barricades, and knowing well that her actual military\r\nand naval superiority was being rapidly diminished by Russia\u0027s warlike\r\npreparations,* she suddenly broke off diplomatic relations and commenced\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n     * According to an estimate made by the Japanese authorities,\r\n     between April, 1903, and the outbreak of the war, Russia\r\n     increased her naval and military forces in the Far East by\r\n     nineteen war vessels, aggregating 82,415 tons, and 40,000\r\n     soldiers.  In addition to this, one battleship, three\r\n     cruisers, seven torpedo destroyers, and four torpedo boats,\r\n     aggregating about 37,040 tons, were on their way to the\r\n     East, and preparations had been made for increasing the land\r\n     forces by 200,000 men.  For further details, see Asakawa,\r\n     \"The Russo-Japanese Conflict\" (London, 1904), pp. 352-54.\r\n\r\nRussia thus found herself engaged in a war of the first magnitude, of\r\nwhich no one can predict the ultimate consequences, and the question\r\nnaturally arises as to why, with an Emperor who lately aspired to play\r\nin politics the part of a great peacemaker, she provoked a conflict,\r\nfor which she was very imperfectly prepared--imposing on herself the\r\nobligation of defending a naval fortress, hastily constructed on foreign\r\nterritory, and united with her base by a single line of railway 6,000\r\nmiles long. The question is easily answered: she did not believe in the\r\npossibility of war. The Emperor was firmly resolved that he would not\r\nattack Japan, and no one would admit for a moment that Japan could have\r\nthe audacity to attack the great Russian Empire. In the late autumn\r\nof 1903, it is true, a few well-informed officials in St. Petersburg,\r\ninfluenced by the warnings of Baron Rosen, the Russian Minister in\r\nTokio, began to perceive that perhaps Japan would provoke a conflict,\r\nbut they were convinced that the military and naval preparations\r\nalready made were quite sufficient to repel the attack. One of these\r\nofficials--probably the best informed of all--said to me quite frankly:\r\n\"If Japan had attacked us in May or June, we should have been in a sorry\r\nplight, but now [November, 1903] we are ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole past history of territoral expansion in Asia tended to confirm\r\nthe prevailing illusions. Russia had advanced steadily from the Ural\r\nand the Caspian to the Hindu Kush and the Northern Pacific without once\r\nencountering serious resistance. Not once had she been called on to make\r\na great national effort, and the armed resistance of the native races\r\nhad never inflicted on her anything worse than pin-pricks. From decrepit\r\nChina, which possessed no army in the European sense of the term, a more\r\nenergetic resistance was not to be expected. Had not Muravieff Amurski\r\nwith a few Cossacks quietly occupied her Amur territories without\r\nprovoking anything more dangerous than a diplomatic protest; and had\r\nnot Ignatief annexed her rich Primorsk provinces, including the site of\r\nVladivostok, by purely diplomatic means? Why should not Count Cassini,\r\na diplomatist of the same type as Ignatief, imitate his adroit\r\npredecessor, and secure for Russia, if not the formal annexation, at\r\nleast the permanent occupation, of Manchuria? Remembering all this, we\r\ncan perceive that the great mistake of the Russian Government is not\r\nso very difficult to explain. It certainly did not want war--far from\r\nit--but it wanted to obtain Manchuria by a gradual, painless process\r\nof absorption, and it did not perceive that this could not be attained\r\nwithout a life-and-death struggle with a young, vigorous nationality,\r\nwhich has contrived to combine the passions and virtues of a primitive\r\nrace with the organising powers and scientific appliances of the most\r\nadvanced civilisation.\r\n\r\nRussian territorial expansion has thus been checked, for some years to\r\ncome, on the Pacific coast; but the expansive tendency will re-appear\r\nsoon in other regions, and it behooves us to be watchful, because,\r\nwhatever direction it may take, it is likely to affect our interests\r\ndirectly or indirectly. Will it confine itself for some years to a\r\nprocess of infiltration in Mongolia and Northern Thibet, the line of\r\nleast resistance? Or will it impinge on our Indian frontier, directed by\r\nthose who desire to avenge themselves on Japan\u0027s ally for the reverses\r\nsustained in Manchuria? Or will it once more take the direction of the\r\nBosphorous, where a campaign might be expected to awaken religious and\r\nwarlike enthusiasm among the masses? To these questions I cannot give\r\nany answer, because so much depends on the internal consequences of the\r\npresent war, and on accidental circumstances which no one can at\r\npresent foresee. I have always desired, and still desire, that we should\r\ncultivate friendly relations with our great rival, and that we should\r\nlearn to appreciate the many good qualities of her people; but I have at\r\nthe same time always desired that we should keep a watchful eye on\r\nher irrepressible tendency to expand, and that we should take timely\r\nprecautions against any unprovoked aggression, however justifiable it\r\nmay seem to her from the point of view of her own national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT SITUATION\r\n\r\n\r\nReform or Revolution?--Reigns of Alexander II. and Nicholas II.\r\nCompared and Contrasted--The Present Opposition--Various Groups--The\r\nConstitutionalists--Zemski Sobors--The Young Tsar Dispels\r\nIllusions--Liberal Frondeurs--Plehve\u0027s Repressive Policy--Discontent\r\nIncreased by the War--Relaxation and Wavering under Prince\r\nMirski--Reform Enthusiasm--The Constitutionalists Formulate their\r\nDemands--The Social Democrats--Father Gapon\u0027s Demonstration--The\r\nSocialist-Revolutionaries--The Agrarian Agitators--The\r\nSubject-Nationalities--Numerical Strength of the Various Groups--All\r\nUnited on One Point--Their Different Aims--Possible Solutions of the\r\nCrisis--Difficulties of Introducing Constitutional Regime--A Strong Man\r\nWanted--Uncertainty of the Future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs history about to repeat itself, or are we on the eve of a cataclysm?\r\nIs the reign of Nicholas II. to be, in its main lines, a repetition of\r\nthe reign of Alexander II., or is Russia about to enter on an entirely\r\nnew phase of her political development?\r\n\r\nTo this momentous question I do not profess to give a categorical\r\nanswer. If it be true, even in ordinary times, that \"of all forms of\r\nhuman folly, prediction is the most gratuitous,\" it is especially true\r\nat a moment like the present, when we are constantly reminded of the\r\nFrench proverb that there is nothing certain but the unforeseen. All\r\nI can hope to do is to throw a little light on the elements of the\r\nproblem, and allow the reader to draw his own conclusions.\r\n\r\nBetween the present situation and the early part of Alexander II.\u0027s\r\nreign there is undoubtedly a certain analogy. In both cases we find\r\nin the educated classes a passionate desire for political liberty,\r\ngenerated by long years of a stern, autocratic regime, and stimulated by\r\nmilitary disasters for which autocracy is held responsible; and in both\r\ncases we find the throne occupied by a Sovereign of less accentuated\r\npolitical convictions and less energetic character than his immediate\r\npredecessor. In the earlier case, the autocrat, showing more\r\nperspicacity and energy than were expected of him, guides and controls\r\nthe popular enthusiasm, and postpones the threatened political crisis\r\nby effecting a series of far reaching and beneficent reforms. In the\r\npresent case . . . the description of the result must be left to future\r\nhistorians. For the moment, all we can say is that between the two\r\nsituations there are as many points of difference as of analogy. After\r\nthe Crimean War the enthusiasm was of a vague, eclectic kind, and\r\nconsequently it could find satisfaction in practical administrative\r\nreforms not affecting the essence of the Autocratic Power, the main\r\npivot round which the Empire has revolved for centuries. Now, on the\r\ncontrary, it is precisely on this pivot that the reform enthusiasm is\r\nconcentrated. Mere bureaucratic reforms can no longer give satisfaction.\r\nAll sections of the educated classes, with the exception of a small\r\ngroup of Conservative doctrinaires, insist on obtaining a controlling\r\ninfluence in the government of the country, and demand that the\r\nAutocratic Power, if not abolished, shall be limited by parliamentary\r\ninstitutions of a democratic type.\r\n\r\nAnother difference between the present and the past, is that those who\r\nnow clamour for radical changes are more numerous, more courageous,\r\nand better organised than their predecessors, and they are consequently\r\nbetter able to bring pressure to bear on the Government. Formerly\r\nthe would-be reformers were of two categories; on the one hand, the\r\nConstitutionalists, who remained within the bounds of legality, and\r\nconfined themselves to inserting vague hints in loyal addresses to the\r\nTsar and making mild political demonstrations; and on the other\r\nhand, the so-called Nihilists, who talked about organising society on\r\nSocialistic principles, and who hoped to attain their object by means of\r\nsecret associations. With both of these groups, as soon as they became\r\naggressive, the Government had no difficulty in dealing effectually. The\r\nleading Constitutionalists were simply reprimanded or ordered to\r\nremain for a time in their country houses, while the more active\r\nrevolutionaries were exiled, imprisoned, or compelled to take refuge\r\nabroad. All this gave the police a good deal of trouble, especially when\r\nthe Nihilists took to Socialist propaganda among the common people, and\r\nto acts of terrorism against the officials; but the existence of the\r\nAutocratic Power was never seriously endangered. Nowadays the Liberals\r\nhave no fear of official reprimands, and openly disregard the orders\r\nof the authorities about holding meetings and making speeches, while a\r\nlarge section of the Socialists proclaim themselves a Social Democratic\r\nparty, enrol large numbers of working men, organise formidable strikes,\r\nand make monster demonstrations leading to bloodshed.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine this new Opposition a little more closely. We can\r\nperceive at a glance that it is composed of two sections, differing\r\nwidely from each other in character and aims. On the one hand, there\r\nare the Liberals, who desire merely political reforms of a more or less\r\ndemocratic type; on the other, there are the Socialists, who aim at\r\ntransforming thoroughly the existing economic organisation of Society,\r\nand who, if they desire parliamentary institutions at all, desire them\r\nsimply as a stepping stone to the realisation of the Socialist ideal.\r\nBehind the Socialists, and to some extent mingling with them, stand a\r\nnumber of men belonging to the various subject-nationalities, who have\r\nplaced themselves under the Socialist banner, but who hold, more or\r\nless concealed, their little national flags, ready to be unfurled at the\r\nproper moment.\r\n\r\nOf these three sections of the Opposition, the most numerous and\r\nthe best prepared to undertake the functions and responsibilities of\r\ngovernment is that of the Liberals. The movement which they represent\r\nbegan immediately after the Crimean War, when the upper ranks of\r\nsociety, smarting under defeat and looking about for the cause of the\r\nmilitary disasters, came to the conclusion that Autocracy had been\r\nput to a crucial test, and found wanting. The outburst of patriotic\r\nindignation at that time and the eager desire for a more liberal regime\r\nhave been described in previous chapters. For a moment the more sanguine\r\ncritics of the Government imagined that the Autocratic Power, persuaded\r\nof its own inefficiency, would gladly accept the assistance of the\r\neducated classes, and would spontaneously transform itself into\r\na Constitutional Monarchy. In reality Alexander II. had no such\r\nintentions. He was resolved to purify the administration and to reform\r\nas far as possible all existing abuses, and he seemed ready at first\r\nto listen to the advice and accept the co-operation of his faithful\r\nsubjects; but he had not the slightest intention of limiting his supreme\r\nauthority, which he regarded as essential to the existence of the\r\nEmpire. As soon as the landed proprietors began to complain that the\r\ngreat question of serf emancipation was being taken out of their hands\r\nby the bureaucracy, he reminded them that \"in Russia laws are made by\r\nthe Autocratic Power,\" and when the more courageous Marshals of Noblesse\r\nventured to protest against the unceremonious manner in which the nobles\r\nwere being treated by the tchinovniks, some of them were officially\r\nreprimanded and others were deposed.\r\n\r\nThe indignation produced by this procedure, in which the Tsar identified\r\nhimself with the bureaucracy, was momentarily appeased by the decision\r\nof the Government to entrust to the landed proprietors the carrying out\r\nof the Emancipation law, and by the confident hope that political rights\r\nwould be granted them as compensation for the material sacrifices\r\nthey had made for the good of the State; but when they found that\r\nthis confident hope was an illusion, the indignation and discontent\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\nThere was still, however, a ray of hope. Though the Autocratic Power\r\nwas evidently determined not to transform itself at once into a limited\r\nConstitutional Monarchy, it might make concessions in the sphere of\r\nlocal self-government. At that moment it was creating the Zemstvo,\r\nand the Constitutionalists hoped that these new institutions, though\r\nrestricted legally to the sphere of purely economic wants, might\r\ngradually acquire a considerable political influence. Learned Germans\r\nhad proved that in England, \"the mother of modern Constitutionalism,\" it\r\nwas on local self-government that the political liberties were founded,\r\nand the Slavophils now suggested that by means of an ancient institution\r\ncalled the Zemski Sobor, the Zemstvo might gradually and naturally\r\nacquire a political character in accordance with Russian historic\r\ndevelopment. As this idea has often been referred to in recent\r\ndiscussions, I may explain briefly what the ancient institution in\r\nquestion was.\r\n\r\nIn the Tsardom of Muscovy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\r\nrepresentative assemblies were occasionally called together to deal with\r\nmatters of exceptional importance, such as the election of a Tsar when\r\nthe throne became vacant, a declaration of war, the conclusion of a\r\npeace, or the preparation of a new code of laws. Some fifteen assemblies\r\nof the kind were convoked in the space of about a century (1550-1653).\r\nThey were composed largely of officials named by the Government, but\r\nthey contained also some representatives of the unofficial classes.\r\nTheir procedure was peculiar. When a speech from the throne had been\r\nread by the Tsar or his representative, explaining the question to\r\nbe decided, the assembly transformed itself into a large number of\r\ncommissions, and each commission had to give in writing its opinion\r\nregarding the questions submitted to it. The opinions thus elicited were\r\ncodified by the officials and submitted to the Tsar, and he was free to\r\nadopt or reject them, as he thought fit. We may say, therefore, that the\r\nZemski Sobor was merely consultative and had no legislative power; but\r\nwe must add that it was allowed a certain initiative, because it was\r\npermitted to submit to the Tsar humble petitions regarding anything\r\nwhich it considered worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nAlexander II. might have adopted this Slavophil idea and used the Zemski\r\nSobor as a means of transition from pure autocracy to a more modern\r\nsystem of government, but he had no sooner created the Zemstvo than he\r\nthought it necessary, as we have seen, to clip its wings, and dispel its\r\npolitical ambition. By this repressive policy the frondeur spirit of the\r\nNoblesse was revived, and it has continued to exist down to the present\r\ntime. On each occasion when I revisited Russia and had an opportunity\r\nof feeling the pulse of public opinion, between 1876 and 1903, I noticed\r\nthat the dissatisfaction with the traditional methods of government, and\r\nthe desire of the educated classes to obtain a share of the political\r\npower, notwithstanding short periods of apparent apathy, were steadily\r\nspreading in area and increasing in intensity, and I often heard\r\npredictions that a disastrous foreign war like the Crimean campaign\r\nwould probably bring about the desired changes. Of those who made such\r\npredictions not a few showed clearly that, though patriotic enough in a\r\ncertain sense, they would not regret any military disaster which would\r\nhave the effect they anticipated. Progress in the direction of political\r\nemancipation, accompanied by radical improvements in the administration,\r\nwas evidently regarded as much more important and desirable than\r\nmilitary prestige or extension of territory.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the Turkish campaign of 1877-78, when the\r\nRussian armies were repulsed in Bulgaria and Asia Minor, the hostility\r\nto autocracy was very strong, and the famous acquittal of Vera\r\nZasulitch, who had attempted to assassinate General Trepof, caused\r\nwidespread satisfaction among people who were not themselves\r\nrevolutionaries and who did not approve of such violent methods of\r\npolitical struggle. Towards the end of the war, when the tide of fortune\r\nhad turned both in Europe and in Asia, and the Russian army was encamped\r\nunder the walls of Constantinople, within sight of St. Sophia, the\r\nChauvinist feelings gained the upper hand, and they were greatly\r\nintensified by the Congress of Berlin, which deprived Russia of some\r\nfruits of her victories.\r\n\r\nThis change in public feeling and the horror excited by the\r\nassassination of Alexander II. prepared the way for Alexander III.\u0027s\r\nreign (1881-94), which was a period of political stagnation. He was a\r\nman of strong character, and a vigorous ruler who believed in Autocracy\r\nas he did in the dogmas of his Church; and very soon after his accession\r\nhe gave it clearly to be understood that he would permit no limitations\r\nof the Autocratic Power. The men with Liberal aspirations knew that\r\nnothing would make him change his mind on that subject, and that any\r\nLiberal demonstrations would merely confirm him in his reactionary\r\ntendencies. They accordingly remained quiet and prudently waited for\r\nbetter times.\r\n\r\nThe better times were supposed to have come when Nicholas II. ascended\r\nthe throne in November, 1894, because it was generally assumed that\r\nthe young Tsar, who was known to be humane and well-intentioned, would\r\ninaugurate a more liberal policy. Before he had been three months on the\r\nthrone he summarily destroyed these illusions. On 17th (29th) January,\r\n1895, when receiving deputies from the Noblesse, the Zemstvo, and the\r\nmunicipalities, who had come to St. Petersburg to congratulate him on\r\nhis marriage, he declared his confidence in the sincerity of the loyal\r\nfeelings which the delegates expressed; and then, to the astonishment of\r\nall present, he added: \"It is known to me that recently, in some Zemstvo\r\nassemblies, were heard the voices of people who had let themselves be\r\ncarried away by absurd dreams of the Zemstvo representatives taking\r\npart in the affairs of internal administration; let them know that I,\r\ndevoting all my efforts to the prosperity of the nation, will preserve\r\nthe principles of autocracy as firmly and unswervingly as my late father\r\nof imperishable memory.\"\r\n\r\nThese words, pronounced by the young ruler at the commencement of his\r\nreign, produced profound disappointment and dissatisfaction in all\r\nsections of the educated classes, and from that moment the frondeur\r\nspirit began to show itself more openly than at any previous period. In\r\nthe case of some people of good social position it took the unusual form\r\nof speaking disrespectfully of his Majesty. Others supposed that the\r\nEmperor had simply repeated words prepared for him by the Minister\r\nof the Interior, and this idea spread rapidly, till hostility to the\r\nbureaucracy became universal.\r\n\r\nThis feeling reached its climax when the Ministry of the Interior\r\nwas confided to M. Plehve. His immediate predecessors, though sincere\r\nbelievers in autocracy and very hostile to Liberalism of all kinds,\r\nconsidered that the Liberal ideas might be rendered harmless by firm\r\npassive resistance and mild reactionary measures. He, on the contrary,\r\ntook a more alarmist view of the situation. His appointment coincided\r\nwith the revival of terrorism, and he believed that autocracy was in\r\ndanger. To save it, the only means was, in his opinion, a vigorous,\r\nrepressive police administration, and as he was a man of strong\r\nconvictions and exceptional energy, he screwed up his system of police\r\nsupervision to the sticking-point and applied it to the Liberals as well\r\nas to the terrorists. In the year 1903, if we may credit information\r\nwhich comes from an apparently trustworthy source, no less than 1,988\r\npolitical affairs were initiated by the police, and 4,867 persons were\r\ncondemned inquisitorially to various punishments without any regular\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nWhilst this unpopular rigorism was in full force the war unexpectedly\r\nbroke out, and added greatly to the existing discontent.\r\n\r\nVery few people in Russia had been following closely the recent\r\ndevelopments of the Far Eastern Question, and still fewer understood\r\ntheir importance. There seemed to be nothing abnormal in what was taking\r\nplace. Russia was expanding, and would continue to expand indefinitely,\r\nin that direction, without any strenuous effort on her part. Of course\r\nthe English would try to arrest her progress as usual by diplomatic\r\nnotes, but their efforts would be as futile as they had been on all\r\nprevious occasions. They might incite the Japanese to active resistance,\r\nbut Japan would not commit the insane folly of challenging her\r\ngiant rival to mortal combat. The whole question could be settled in\r\naccordance with Russian interests, as so many similar questions had been\r\nsettled in the past, by a little skilful diplomacy; and Manchuria could\r\nbe absorbed, as the contiguous Chinese provinces had been forty years\r\nago, without the necessity of going to war.\r\n\r\nWhen these comforting illusions were suddenly destroyed by the rupture\r\nof diplomatic relations and the naval attack on Port Arthur, there was\r\nan outburst of indignant astonishment. At first the indignation was\r\ndirected against Japan and England, but it soon turned against the home\r\nGovernment, which had made no adequate preparations for the struggle,\r\nand it was intensified by current rumours that the crisis had been\r\nwantonly provoked by certain influential personages for purely personal\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nHow far the accounts of the disorders in the military organisation and\r\nthe rumours about pilfering in high quarters were true, we need not\r\ninquire. True or false, they helped greatly to make the war unpopular,\r\nand to stimulate the desire for political changes. Under a more liberal\r\nand enlightened regime such things were supposed to be impossible, and,\r\nas at the time of the Crimean War, public opinion decided that autocracy\r\nwas being tried, and found wanting.\r\n\r\nSo long as the stern, uncompromising Plehve was at the Ministry of the\r\nInterior, enjoying the Emperor\u0027s confidence and directing the police\r\nadministration, public opinion was prudent and reserved in its\r\nutterances, but when he was assassinated by a terrorist (July 28th,\r\n1904), and was succeeded by Prince Sviatopolk Mirski, a humane man of\r\nLiberal views, the Constitutionalists thought that the time had come for\r\nmaking known their grievances and demands, and for bringing pressure\r\nto bear on the Emperor. First came forward the leading members of the\r\nZemstvos. After some preliminary consultation they assembled in St.\r\nPetersburg, with the consent of the authorities, in the hope that they\r\nwould be allowed to discuss publicly the political wants of the\r\ncountry, and prepare the draft of a Constitution. Their wishes were\r\nonly partially acceded to. They were informed semi-officially that their\r\nmeetings must be private, but that they might send their resolutions\r\nto the Minister of the Interior for transmission to his Majesty. A\r\nmemorandum was accordingly drawn up and signed on November 21st by 102\r\nout of the 104 representatives present.\r\n\r\nThis hesitating attitude on the part of the Government encouraged\r\nother sections of the educated classes to give expression to their long\r\npent-up political aspirations. On the heels of the Zemstvo delegates\r\nappeared the barristers, who discussed the existing evils from the\r\njuridical point of view, and prescribed what they considered the\r\nnecessary remedies. Then came municipalities of the large towns,\r\ncorporations of various kinds, academic leagues, medical faculties,\r\nlearned societies, and miscellaneous gatherings, all demanding reforms.\r\nGreat banquets were organised, and very strong speeches, which would\r\nhave led in Plehve\u0027s time to the immediate arrest of the orators, were\r\ndelivered and published without provoking police intervention.\r\n\r\nIn the memorandum presented to the Minister of the Interior by the\r\nZemstvo Congress, and in the resolutions passed by the other corporate\r\nbodies, we see reflected the grievances and aspirations of the great\r\nmajority of the educated classes.\r\n\r\nThe theory propounded in these documents is that a lawless, arbitrary\r\nbureaucracy, which seeks to exclude the people from all participation\r\nin the management of public affairs, has come between the nation and\r\nthe Supreme Power, and that it is necessary to eliminate at once this\r\nbaneful intermediary and inaugurate the so-called \"reign of law.\" For\r\nthis purpose the petitioners and orators demanded:\r\n\r\n(1) Inviolability of person and domicile, so that no one should be\r\ntroubled by the police without a warrant from an independent magistrate,\r\nand no one punished without a regular trial;\r\n\r\n(2) Freedom of conscience, of speech, and of the Press, together with\r\nthe right of holding public meetings and forming associations;\r\n\r\n(3) Greater freedom and increased activity of the local self-government,\r\nrural and municipal;\r\n\r\n(4) An assembly of freely elected representatives, who should\r\nparticipate in the legislative activity and control the administration\r\nin all its branches;\r\n\r\n(5) The immediate convocation of a constituent assembly, which should\r\nframe a Constitution on these lines.\r\n\r\nOf these requirements the last two are considered by far the most\r\nimportant. The truth is that the educated classes have come to be\r\npossessed of an ardent desire for genuine parliamentary institutions on\r\na broad, democratic basis, and neither improvements in the bureaucratic\r\norganisation, nor even a Zemski Sobor in the sense of a Consultative\r\nAssembly, would satisfy them. They imagine that with a full-fledged\r\nconstitution they would be guaranteed, not only against administrative\r\noppression, but even against military reverses such as they have\r\nrecently experienced in the Far East--an opinion in which those who know\r\nby experience how military unreadiness and inefficiency can be combined\r\nwith parliamentary institutions will hardly feel inclined to concur.\r\n\r\nIt may surprise English readers to learn that the corruption and\r\nvenality of the civil and military administration, of which we have\r\nrecently heard so much, are nowhere mentioned in the complaints and\r\nremonstrances; but the fact is easily accounted for. Though corrupt\r\npractices undoubtedly exist in some branches of the public service, they\r\nare not so universal as is commonly supposed in Western Europe; and\r\nthe Russian reformers evidently consider that the purifying of the\r\nadministration is less urgent than the acquisition of political\r\nliberties, or that under an enlightened democratic regime the existing\r\nabuses would spontaneously disappear.\r\n\r\nThe demands put forward in St. Petersburg did not meet with universal\r\napproval in Moscow. There they seemed excessive and un-Russian, and an\r\nattempt was made to form a more moderate party. In the ancient Capital\r\nof the Tsars even among the Liberals there are not a few who have a\r\nsentimental tenderness for the Autocratic Power, and they argue that\r\nparliamentary government would be very dangerous in a country which is\r\nstill far from being homogeneous or compact. To maintain the integrity\r\nof the Empire, and to hold the balance equally between the various races\r\nand social classes of which the population is composed, it is necessary,\r\nthey think, to have some permanent authority above the sphere of party\r\nspirit and electioneering strife. While admitting that the Government\r\nin its present bureaucratic form is unsatisfactory and stands in need\r\nof being enlightened by the unofficial classes, they think that a\r\nConsultative Assembly on the model of the old Zemski Sobors would be\r\ninfinitely better suited to Russian wants than a Parliament such as that\r\nwhich sits at Westminster.\r\n\r\nFor a whole month the Government took little notice of the unprecedented\r\nexcitement and demonstrations. It was not till December 25th that a\r\nreply was given to the public demands. On that day the Emperor signed an\r\nukaz in which he enumerated the reforms which he considered most urgent,\r\nand instructed the Committee of Ministers to prepare the requisite\r\nlegislation. The list of reforms coincided to a certain extent with the\r\ndemands formulated by the Zemstvos, but the document as a whole produced\r\nprofound disappointment, because it contained no mention of a National\r\nAssembly. To those who could read between the lines the attitude of the\r\nEmperor seemed perfectly clear. He was evidently desirous of introducing\r\nvery considerable reforms, but he was resolved that they must be\r\neffected by the unimpaired Autocratic Power in the old bureaucratic\r\nfashion, without any participation of the unofficial world.\r\n\r\nTo obviate any misconception on this point, the Government published,\r\nsimultaneously with the ukaz, an official communication in which\r\nit condemned the agitation and excitement, and warned the Zemstvos,\r\nmunicipalities, and other corporate bodies that in discussing political\r\nquestions they were overstepping the limits of their legally-defined\r\nfunctions and exposing themselves to the rigours of the law.\r\n\r\nAs might have been foreseen, the ukaz and the circular had not at all\r\nthe desired effect of \"introducing the necessary tranquillity into\r\npublic life, which has lately been diverted from its normal course.\" On\r\nthe contrary, they increased the excitement, and evoked a new series of\r\npublic demonstrations. On December 27th, the very day on which the two\r\nofficial documents were published--the Provincial Zemstvo of Moscow,\r\nopenly disregarding the ministerial warnings, expressed the conviction\r\nthat the day was near when the bureaucratic regime, which had so long\r\nestranged the Supreme Power from the people, would be changed, and\r\nwhen freely-elected representatives of the people would take part\r\nin legislation. The same evening, at St. Petersburg, a great Liberal\r\nbanquet was held, at which a resolution was voted condemning the war,\r\nand declaring that Russia could be extricated from her difficulties only\r\nby the representatives of the nation, freely elected by secret ballot.\r\nAs an encouragement to the organs of local administration to persevere\r\nin their disregard of ministerial instructions, the St. Petersburg\r\nMedical Society, after adopting the programme of the Zemstvo Congress,\r\nsent telegrams of congratulation to the Mayor of Moscow and the\r\nPresident of the Tchernigof Zemstvo bureau, both of whom had incurred\r\nthe displeasure of the Government. A similar telegram was sent by a\r\nCongress of 496 engineers to the Moscow Town Council, in which the\r\nburning political questions had been freely discussed. In other large\r\ntowns, when the mayor prevented such discussions, a considerable number\r\nof the town councillors resigned.\r\n\r\nFrom the Zemstvos and municipalities the spirit of opposition spread to\r\nthe provincial assemblies of the Noblesse. The nobles of the province of\r\nSt. Petersburg, for example, voted by a large majority an address to the\r\nTsar recommending the convocation of a freely-elected National Assembly;\r\nand in Moscow, usually regarded as the fortress of Conservatism, eighty\r\nmembers of the Assembly entered a formal protest against a patriotic\r\nConservative address which had been voted two days before. Even the\r\nfair sex considered it necessary to support the opposition movement. The\r\nmatrons of Moscow, in a humble petition to the Empress, declared that\r\nthey could not continue to bring up their children properly in the\r\nexisting state of unconstitutional lawlessness, and their view was\r\nendorsed in several provincial towns by the schoolboys, who marched\r\nthrough the streets in procession, and refused to learn their lessons\r\nuntil popular liberties had been granted!\r\n\r\nAgain, for more than a month the Government remained silent on the\r\nfundamental questions which were exercising the public mind. At last,\r\non the morning of March 3d, appeared an Imperial manifesto of a very\r\nunexpected kind. In it the Emperor deplored the outbreak of internal\r\ndisturbances at a moment when the glorious sons of Russia were fighting\r\nwith self-sacrificing bravery and offering their lives for the Faith,\r\nthe Tsar, and the Fatherland; but he drew consolation and hope from\r\nremembering that, with the help of the prayers of the Holy Orthodox\r\nChurch, under the banner of the Tsar\u0027s autocratic might, Russia had\r\nfrequently passed through great wars and internal troubles, and had\r\nalways issued from them with fresh strength. He appealed, therefore, to\r\nall right-minded subjects, to whatever class they might belong, to join\r\nhim in the great and sacred task of overcoming the stubborn foreign foe,\r\nand eradicating revolt at home. As for the manner in which he hoped this\r\nmight be accomplished, he gave a pretty clear indication, at the end\r\nof the document, by praying to God, not only for the welfare of his\r\nsubjects, but also for \"the consolidation of autocracy.\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary pronouncement, couched in semi-ecclesiastical\r\nlanguage, produced in the Liberal world feelings of surprise,\r\ndisappointment, and dismay. No one was more astonished and dismayed than\r\nthe Ministers, who had known nothing of the manifesto until they saw it\r\nin the official Gazette. In the course of the forenoon they paid their\r\nusual weekly visit to Tsarskoe Selo, and respectfully submitted to the\r\nEmperor that such a document must have a deplorable effect on public\r\nopinion. In consequence of their representations his Majesty consented\r\nto supplement the manifesto by a rescript to the Minister of the\r\nInterior, in which he explained that in carrying out his intentions for\r\nthe welfare of his people the Government was to have the co-operation of\r\n\"the experienced elements of the community.\" Then followed the memorable\r\nwords: \"I am resolved henceforth, with the help of God, to convene the\r\nmost worthy men, possessing the confidence of the people and elected\r\nby them, in order that they may participate in the preparation and\r\nconsideration of legislative measures.\" For the carrying out of this\r\nresolution a commission, or \"special conference,\" was to be at once\r\nconvened, under the presidency of M. Bulyghin, the Minister of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nThe rescript softened the impression produced by the manifesto, but\r\nit did not give general satisfaction, because it contained significant\r\nindications that the Emperor, while promising to create an assembly of\r\nsome kind, was still determined to maintain the Autocratic Power. So\r\nat least the public interpreted a vague phase about the difficulty of\r\nintroducing reforms \"while preserving absolutely the immutability of\r\nthe fundamental laws of the Empire.\" And this impression seemed to\r\nbe confirmed by the fact that the task of preparing the future\r\nrepresentative institutions was confided, not to a constituent assembly,\r\nbut to a small commission composed chiefly or entirely of officials.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Liberals determined to continue the\r\nagitation. The Bulyghin Commission was accordingly inundated with\r\npetitions and addresses explaining the wants of the nation in general,\r\nand of various sections of it in particular; and when the Minister\r\ndeclined to receive deputations and discuss with them the aforesaid\r\nwants, the reform question was taken up by a new series of congresses,\r\ncomposed of doctors, lawyers, professors, journalists, etc. Even the\r\nhigher ecclesiastical dignitaries woke up for a moment from their\r\naccustomed lethargy, remembered how they had lived for so many years\r\nunder the rod of M. Pobedonostsef, recognised as uncanonical such\r\nsubordination to a layman, and petitioned for the resurrection of the\r\nPatriarchate, which had been abolished by Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nOn May 9th a new Zemstvo Congress was held in Moscow, and it at once\r\nshowed that since their November session in St. Petersburg the delegates\r\nhad made a decided movement to the Left. Those of them who had then led\r\nthe movement were now regarded as too Conservative. The idea of a\r\nZemski Sobor was discarded as insufficient for the necessities of the\r\nsituation, and strong speeches were made in support of a much more\r\ndemocratic constitution.\r\n\r\nIt was thus becoming clearer every day that between the Liberals and the\r\nGovernment there was an essential difference which could not be removed\r\nby ordinary concessions. The Emperor proved that he was in favour of\r\nreform by granting a very large measure of religious toleration, by\r\nremoving some of the disabilities imposed on the Poles, and allowing the\r\nPolish language to be used in schools, and by confirming the proposals\r\nof the Committee of Ministers to place the Press censure on a legal\r\nbasis. But these concessions to public opinion did not gain for him the\r\nsympathy and support of his Liberal subjects. What they insisted on was\r\na considerable limitation of the Autocratic Power; and on that point the\r\nEmperor has hitherto shown himself inexorable. His firmness proceeds\r\nnot from any wayward desire to be able to do as he pleases, but from a\r\nhereditary respect for a principle. From his boyhood he has been taught\r\nthat Russia owes her greatness and her security to her autocratic form\r\nof government, and that it is the sacred duty of the Tsar to hand down\r\nintact to his successors the power which he holds in trust for them.\r\n\r\nWhile the Liberals were thus striving to attain their object without\r\npopular disorders, and without any very serious infraction of the law,\r\nRevolutionaries were likewise busy, working on different but parallel\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the present phase of the revolutionary movement I\r\nhave sketched briefly the origin and character of the two main Socialist\r\ngroups, and I have now merely to convey a general idea of their attitude\r\nduring recent events. And first, of the Social Democrats.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1894 the Social Democrats were in what may be called their\r\nnormal condition--that is to say, they were occupied in organising and\r\ndeveloping the Labour Movement. The removal of Plehve, who had greatly\r\nhampered them by his energetic police administration, enabled them to\r\nwork more freely, and they looked with a friendly eye on the efforts\r\nof the Liberal Zemstvo-ists; but they took no part in the agitation,\r\nbecause the Zemstvo world lay outside their sphere of action. In the\r\nlabour world, to which they confined their attention, they must have\r\nforeseen that a crisis would sooner or later be produced by the war, and\r\nthat they would then have an excellent opportunity of preaching\r\ntheir doctrine that for all the sufferings of the working classes the\r\nGovernment is responsible. What they did not foresee was that serious\r\nlabour troubles were so near at hand, and that the conflict with the\r\nauthorities would be accelerated by Father Gapon. Accustomed to regard\r\nhim as a persistent opponent, they did not expect him to become suddenly\r\nan energetic, self-willed ally. Hence they were taken unawares, and at\r\nfirst the direction of the movement was by no means entirely in their\r\nhands. Very soon, however, they grasped the situation, and utilised\r\nit for their own ends. It was in great measure due to their secret\r\norganisation and activity that the strike in the Putilof Ironworks,\r\nwhich might easily have been terminated amicably, spread rapidly not\r\nonly to the other works and factories in St. Petersburg, but also to\r\nthose of Moscow, Riga, Warsaw, Lodz, and other industrial centres.\r\nThough they did not approve of Father Gapon\u0027s idea of presenting\r\na petition to the Tsar, the loss of life which his demonstration\r\noccasioned was very useful to them in their efforts to propagate the\r\nbelief that the Autocratic Power is the ally of the capitalists and\r\nhostile to the claims and aspirations of the working classes.\r\n\r\nThe other great Socialist group contributed much more largely towards\r\nbringing about the present state of things. It was their Militant\r\nOrganisation that assassinated Plehve, and thereby roused the Liberals\r\nto action. To them, likewise, is due the subsequent assassination of the\r\nGrand Duke Serge, and it is an open secret that they are preparing other\r\nacts of terrorism of a similar kind. At the same time they have been\r\nvery active in creating provincial revolutionary committees, in printing\r\nand distributing revolutionary literature, and, above all, in organising\r\nagrarian disturbances, which they intend to make a very important\r\nfactor in the development of events. Indeed, it is chiefly by agrarian\r\ndisturbances that they hope to overthrow the Autocratic Power and bring\r\nabout the great economic and social revolution to which the political\r\nrevolution would be merely the prologue.\r\n\r\nTherein lies a serious danger.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the propaganda and the insurrectionary agitation\r\nin the seventies, it became customary in revolutionary circles to\r\nregard the muzhik as impervious to Socialist ideas and insurrectionary\r\nexcitement, but the hope of eventually employing him in the cause never\r\nquite died out, and in recent times, when his economic condition in many\r\ndistricts has become critical, attempts have occasionally been made to\r\nembarrass the Government by agrarian disturbances. The method usually\r\nemployed is to disseminate among the peasantry by oral propaganda, by\r\nprinted or hectographed leaflets, and by forged Imperial manifestoes,\r\nthe belief that the Tsar has ordered the land of the proprietors to be\r\ngiven to the rural Communes, and that his benevolent wishes are being\r\nfrustrated by the land-owners and the officials. The forged manifesto\r\nis sometimes written in letters of gold as a proof of its being genuine,\r\nand in one case which I heard of in the province of Poltava, the\r\nrevolutionary agent, wearing the uniform of an aide-de-camp of the\r\nEmperor, induced the village priest to read the document in the parish\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe danger lies in the fact that, quite independent of revolutionary\r\nactivity, there has always been, since the time of the Emancipation, a\r\nwidespread belief among the peasantry that they would sooner or later\r\nreceive the whole of the land. Successive Tsars have tried personally\r\nto destroy this illusion, but their efforts have not been successful.\r\nAlexander II., when passing through a province where the idea was very\r\nprevalent, caused a number of village elders to be brought before him,\r\nand told them in a threatening tone that they must remain satisfied with\r\ntheir allotments and pay their taxes regularly; but the wily peasants\r\ncould not be convinced that the \"General\" who had talked to them in this\r\nsense was really the Tsar. Alexander III. made a similar attempt at the\r\ntime of his accession. To the Volost elders collected together from all\r\nparts of the Empire, he said: \"Do not believe the foolish rumours and\r\nabsurd reports about a redistribution of the land, and addition to your\r\nallotments, and such like things. These reports are disseminated by your\r\nenemies. Every kind of property, your own included, must be inviolable.\"\r\nRecalling these words, Nicholas II. confirmed them at his accession, and\r\nwarned the peasants not to be led astray by evil-disposed persons.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these repeated warnings, the peasants still cling to\r\nthe idea that all the land belongs to them; and the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionaries now announce publicly that they intend to use\r\nthis belief for the purpose of carrying out their revolutionary designs.\r\nIn a pamphlet entitled \"Concerning Liberty and the Means of Obtaining\r\nit,\" they explain their plan of campaign. Under the guidance of the\r\nrevolutionary agents the peasants of each district all over the Empire\r\nare to make it impossible for the proprietors to work their estates, and\r\nthen, after driving away the local authorities and rural police, they\r\nare to take possession of the estates for their own use. The Government,\r\nin its vain attempts to dislodge them, will have to employ all the\r\ntroops at its disposal, and this will give the working classes of the\r\ntowns, led by the revolutionists, an opportunity of destroying the most\r\nessential parts of the administrative mechanism. Thus a great social\r\nrevolution can be successfully accomplished, and any Zemski Sobor or\r\nParliament which may be convoked will merely have to give a legislative\r\nsanction to accomplished facts.\r\n\r\nThese three groups--the Liberals, the Social Democrats, and the\r\nSocialist Revolutionaries--constitute what may be called the purely\r\nRussian Opposition. They found their claims and justify their action\r\non utilitarian and philosophic grounds, and demand liberty (in various\r\nsenses) for themselves and others, independently of race and creed. This\r\ndistinguishes them from the fourth group, who claim to represent\r\nthe subject-nationalities, and who mingle nationalist feelings and\r\naspirations with enthusiasm for liberty and justice in the abstract.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Russifying these subject-nationalities, which was\r\ninaugurated by Alexander III. and maintained by his successor, has\r\nfailed in its object. It has increased the use of the Russian language\r\nin official procedure, modified the system of instruction in the schools\r\nand universities, and brought, nominally, a few schismatic and heretical\r\nsheep into the Eastern Orthodox fold, but it has entirely failed to\r\ninspire the subject-populations with Russian feeling and national\r\npatriotism; on the contrary, it has aroused in them a bitter hostility\r\nto Russian nationality, and to the Central Government. In such of\r\nthem as have retained their old aspirations of political\r\nindependence--notably the Poles--the semi-latent disaffection has been\r\nstimulated; and in those of them which, like the Finlanders and the\r\nArmenians, desire merely to preserve the limited autonomy they formerly\r\nenjoyed, a sentiment of disaffection has been created. All of them\r\nknow very well that in an armed struggle with the dominant Russian\r\nnationality they would speedily be crushed, as the Poles were in 1863.\r\nTheir disaffection shows itself, therefore, merely in resistance to\r\nthe obligatory military service, and in an undisguised or thinly veiled\r\nattitude of systematic hostility, which causes the Government some\r\nanxiety and prevents it from sending to the Far East a large number\r\nof troops which would otherwise be available. They hail, however, with\r\ndelight the Liberal and revolutionary movements in the hope that\r\nthe Russians themselves may undermine, and possibly overthrow, the\r\ntyrannical Autocratic Power. Towards this end they would gladly\r\nco-operate, and they are endeavouring, therefore, to get into touch\r\nwith each other; but they have so little in common, and so many mutually\r\nantagonistic interests, that they are not likely to succeed in forming a\r\nsolid coalition.\r\n\r\nWhile sympathising with every form of opposition to the Government, the\r\nmen of the subject-nationalities reserve their special affection for\r\nthe Socialists, because these not only proclaim, like the Liberals, the\r\nprinciples of extensive local self-government and universal equality\r\nbefore the law, but they also speak of replacing the existing system of\r\ncoercive centralisation by a voluntary confederation of heterogeneous\r\nunits. This explains why so many Poles, Armenians and Georgians are\r\nto be found in the ranks of the Social Democrats and the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nOf the recruits from oppressed nationalities the great majority\r\ncome from the Jews, who, though they have never dreamed of political\r\nindependence, or even of local autonomy, have most reason to complain of\r\nthe existing order of things. At all times they have furnished a goodly\r\ncontingent to the revolutionary movement, and many of them have belied\r\ntheir traditional reputation of timidity and cowardice by taking part in\r\nvery dangerous terrorist enterprises--in some cases ending their career\r\non the scaffold. In 1897 they created a Social-Democratic organisation\r\nof their own, commonly known as the Bund, which joined, in 1898, the\r\nRussian Social-Democratic Labour Party, on the understanding that it\r\nshould retain its independence on all matters affecting exclusively the\r\nJewish population.* It now possesses a very ably-conducted weekly organ,\r\nand of all sections of the Social-Democratic group it is unquestionably\r\nthe best organised. This is not surprising, because the Jews have more\r\nbusiness capacity than the Russians, and centuries of oppression have\r\ndeveloped in the race a wonderful talent for secret illegal activity,\r\nand for eluding the vigilance of the police.\r\n\r\n     * The official title of this Bund is the \"Universal Jewish\r\n     Labour Union in Russia and Poland.\"  Its organ is called\r\n     Sovremenniya Izvestiya (Contemporary News).\r\n\r\nIt would be very interesting to know the numerical strength of these\r\ngroups, but we have no materials for forming even an approximate\r\nestimate. The Liberals are certainly the most numerous. They include the\r\ngreat majority of the educated classes, but they are less persistently\r\nenergetic than their rivals, and their methods of action make less\r\nimpression on the Government. The two Socialist groups, though\r\ncommunicative enough with regard to their doctrines and aims, are\r\nvery reticent with regard to the number of their adherents, and this\r\nnaturally awakens a suspicion that an authoritative statement on the\r\nsubject would tend to diminish rather than enhance their importance in\r\nthe eyes of the public. If statistics of the Social Democrats could\r\nbe obtained, it would be necessary to distinguish between the three\r\ncategories of which the group is composed: (1) The educated active\r\nmembers, who form the directing, controlling element; (2) the fully\r\nindoctrinated recruits from the working classes; and (3) workmen who\r\ndesire merely to better their material condition, but who take part in\r\npolitical demonstrations in the hope of bringing pressure to bear on\r\ntheir employers, and inducing the Government to intervene on their\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nThe two Socialist groups are not only increasing the number of their\r\nadherents; they are also extending and improving their organisation,\r\nas is proved by the recent strikes, which are the work of the Social\r\nDemocrats, and by the increasing rural disturbances and acts of\r\nterrorism, which are the work of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the unorganised Nationalist group, all I can do towards\r\nconveying a vague, general idea of its numerical strength is to give\r\nthe numbers of the populations--men, women, and children--of which the\r\nNationalist agitators are the self-constituted representatives, without\r\nattempting to estimate the percentage of the actively disaffected. The\r\npopulations in question are:\r\n\r\n     Poles          7,900,000\r\n     Jews           5,190,000\r\n     Finlanders     2,592,000\r\n     Armenians      1,200,000\r\n     Georgians        408,000\r\n     ----------              16,495,000\r\n\r\nIf a National Assembly were created, in which all the nationalities\r\nwere represented according to the numbers of the population, the Poles,\r\nroughly speaking, would have 38 members, the Jews 24, the Finlanders 12,\r\nthe Armenians 6, and the Georgians 2: whereas the Russians would\r\nhave about 400. The other subject-nationalities in which symptoms\r\nof revolutionary fermentation have appeared are too insignificant to\r\nrequire special mention.\r\n\r\nAs the representatives of the various subject-nationalities are\r\nendeavouring to combine, so likewise are the Liberals and the two\r\nSocialist groups trying to form a coalition, and for this purpose they\r\nhave already held several conferences. How far they will succeed it is\r\nimpossible to say. On one point--the necessity of limiting or abolishing\r\nthe Autocratic Power--they are unanimous, and there seems to be a tacit\r\nunderstanding that for the present they shall work together amicably\r\non parallel lines, each group reserving its freedom of action for the\r\nfuture, and using meanwhile its own customary means of putting pressure\r\non the Government. We may expect, therefore, that for a time the\r\nLiberals will go on holding conferences and congresses in defiance of\r\nthe police authorities, delivering eloquent speeches, discussing thorny\r\npolitical questions, drafting elaborate constitutions, and making gentle\r\nefforts to clog the wheels of the Administration,* while the\r\nSocial Democrats will continue to organise strikes and semi-pacific\r\ndemonstrations,** and the Socialist-Revolutionaries will seek to\r\naccelerate the march of events by agrarian disturbances and acts of\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n     * As an illustration of this I may cite the fact that\r\n     several Zemstvos have declared themselves unable, under\r\n     present conditions, to support the indigent families of\r\n     soldiers at the front.\r\n\r\n     ** I call them semi-pacific, because on such occasions the\r\n     demonstrators are instructed to refrain from violence only\r\n     so long as the police do not attempt to stop the proceedings\r\n     by force.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, however, that the parting of the ways will be reached\r\nsooner or later, and already there are indications that it is not very\r\nfar off. Liberals and Social Democrats may perhaps work together for\r\na considerable time, because the latter, though publicly committed to\r\nsocialistic schemes which the Liberals must regard with the strongest\r\nantipathy, are willing to accept a Constitutional regime during the\r\nperiod of transition. It is difficult, however, to imagine that the\r\nLiberals, of whom a large proportion are landed proprietors, can long\r\ngo hand in hand with the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who propose to bring\r\nabout the revolution by inciting the peasants to seize unceremoniously\r\nthe estates, live stock, and agricultural implements of the landlords.\r\n\r\nAlready the Socialist-Revolutionaries have begun to speak publicly\r\nof the inevitable rupture in terms by no means flattering to their\r\ntemporary allies. In a brochure recently issued by their central\r\ncommittee the following passage occurs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If we consider the matter seriously and attentively, it becomes evident\r\nthat all the strength of the bourgeoisie lies in its greater or less\r\ncapacity for frightening and intimidating the Government by the fear of\r\na popular rising; but as the bourgeoisie itself stands in mortal terror\r\nof the thing with which it frightens the Government, its position at the\r\nmoment of insurrection will be rather ridiculous and pitiable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the significance of this passage, the reader must know\r\nthat, in the language of the Socialists, bourgeoisie and Liberals are\r\nconvertible terms.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the Liberals find themselves in an awkward strategical\r\nposition. As quiet, respectable members of society they dislike violence\r\nof every kind, and occasionally in moments of excitement they believe\r\nthat they may attain their ends by mere moral pressure, but when\r\nthey find that academic protests and pacific demonstrations make no\r\nperceptible impression on the Government, they become impatient and feel\r\ntempted to approve, at least tacitly, of stronger measures. Many of them\r\ndo not profess to regard with horror and indignation the acts of the\r\nterrorists, and some of them, if I am correctly informed, go so far\r\nas to subscribe to the funds of the Socialist-Revolutionaries without\r\ntaking very stringent precautions against the danger of the money being\r\nemployed for the preparation of dynamite and hand grenades.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary conduct on the part of moderate Liberals may well\r\nsurprise Englishmen, but it is easily explained. The Russians have a\r\nstrong vein of recklessness in their character, and many of them are at\r\npresent imbued with an unquestioning faith in the miracle-working\r\npower of Constitutionalism. These seem to imagine that as soon as\r\nthe Autocratic Power is limited by parliamentary institutions the\r\ndiscontented will cease from troubling and the country will be at rest.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that such expectations are not likely\r\nto be realised. All sections of the educated classes may be agreed in\r\ndesiring \"liberty,\" but the word has many meanings, and nowhere more\r\nthan in Russia at the present day. For the Liberals it means simply\r\ndemocratic parliamentary government; for the Social Democrat it\r\nmeans the undisputed predominance of the Proletariat; for the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary it means the opportunity of realising\r\nimmediately the Socialist ideal; for the representative of a\r\nsubject-nationality it means the abolition of racial and religious\r\ndisabilities and the attainment of local autonomy or political\r\nindependence. There is no doubt, therefore, that in Russia, as in other\r\ncountries, a parliament would develop political parties bitterly hostile\r\nto each other, and its early history might contain some startling\r\nsurprises for those who had helped to create it. If the Constitution,\r\nfor example, were made as democratic as the Liberals and Socialists\r\ndemand, the elections might possibly result in an overwhelming\r\nConservative majority ready to re-establish the Autocratic Power! This\r\nis not at all so absurd as it sounds, for the peasants, apart from the\r\nland question, are thoroughly Conservative. The ordinary muzhik can\r\nhardly conceive that the Emperor\u0027s power can be limited by a law or an\r\nAssembly, and if the idea were suggested to him, he would certainly not\r\napprove. In his opinion the Tsar should be omnipotent. If everything is\r\nnot satisfactory in Russia, it is because the Tsar does not know of the\r\nevil, or is prevented from curing it by the tchinovniks and the landed\r\nproprietors. \"More power, therefore, to his elbow!\" as an Irishman might\r\nsay. Such is the simple political creed of the \"undeveloped\" muzhik, and\r\nall the efforts of the revolutionary groups to develop him have not yet\r\nbeen attended with much success.\r\n\r\nHow, then, the reader may ask, is an issue to be found out of the\r\npresent imbroglio? I cannot pretend to speak with authority, but\r\nit seems to me that there are only two methods of dealing with\r\nthe situation: prompt, energetic repression, or timely, judicious\r\nconcessions to popular feeling. Either of these methods might, perhaps,\r\nhave been successful, but the Government adopted neither, and has halted\r\nbetween the two. By this policy of drift it has encouraged the hopes of\r\nall, has satisfied nobody, and has diminished its own prestige.\r\n\r\nIn defence or extenuation of this attitude it may be said that there\r\nis considerable danger in the adoption of either course. Vigorous\r\nrepression means staking all on a single card, and if it were successful\r\nit could not do more than postpone the evil day, because the present\r\nantiquated form of government--suitable enough, perhaps, for a simply\r\norganised peasant-empire vegetating in an atmosphere of \"eternal\r\nstillness\"--cannot permanently resist the rising tide of modern ideas\r\nand aspirations, and is incapable of grappling successfully with the\r\ncomplicated problems of economic and social progress which are already\r\nawaiting solution. Sooner or later the bureaucratic machine, driven\r\nsolely by the Autocratic Power in the teeth of popular apathy or\r\nopposition, must inevitably break down, and the longer the collapse is\r\npostponed the more violent is it likely to be. On the other hand, it\r\nis impossible to foresee the effects of concessions. Mere bureaucratic\r\nreforms will satisfy no one; they are indeed not wanted except as a\r\nresult of more radical changes. What all sections of the Opposition\r\ndemand is that the people should at least take part in the government\r\nof the country by means of freely elected representatives in Parliament\r\nassembled. It is useless to argue with them that Constitutionalism will\r\ncertainly not work the miracles that are expected of it, and that in the\r\nstruggles of political parties which it is sure to produce the unity and\r\nintegrity of the Empire may be endangered. Lessons of that kind can only\r\nbe learned by experience. Other countries, it is said, have existed\r\nand thriven under free political institutions, and why not Russia?\r\nWhy should she be a pariah among the nations? She gave parliamentary\r\ninstitutions to the young nationalities of the Balkan Peninsula as soon\r\nas they were liberated from Turkish bondage, and she has not yet been\r\nallowed such privileges herself!\r\n\r\nLet us suppose now that the Autocratic Power has come to feel the\r\nimpossibility of remaining isolated as it is at present, and that it has\r\ndecided to seek solid support in some section of the population, what\r\nsection should it choose? Practically it has no choice. The only way of\r\nrelieving the pressure is to make concessions to the Constitutionalists.\r\nThat course would conciliate, not merely the section of the Opposition\r\nwhich calls itself by that name and represents the majority of the\r\neducated classes, but also, in a lesser degree, all the other sections.\r\nNo doubt these latter would accept the concession only as part payment\r\nof their demands and a means of attaining ulterior aims. Again and\r\nagain the Social Democrats have proclaimed publicly that they desire\r\nparliamentary government, not as an end in itself, but as a stepping\r\nstone towards the realisation of the Socialist ideal. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that they would have to remain on this stepping stone for\r\na long series of years--until the representatives of the Proletariat\r\nobtained an overwhelming majority in the Chamber. In like manner the\r\nsubject-nationalities would regard a parliamentary regime as a mere\r\ntemporary expedient--a means of attaining greater local and national\r\nautonomy--and they would probably show themselves more impatient than\r\nthe Social Democrats. Any inordinate claims, however, which they might\r\nput forward would encounter resistance, as the Poles found in 1863, not\r\nmerely from the Autocratic Power, but from the great majority of the\r\nRussian people, who have no sympathy with any efforts tending to bring\r\nabout the disruption of the Empire. In short, as soon as the Assembly\r\nset to work, the delegates would be sobered by a consciousness of\r\nresponsibility, differences of opinion and aims would inevitably appear,\r\nand the various groups transformed into political parties, instead of\r\nall endeavouring as at present to pull down the Autocratic Power, would\r\nexpend a great part of their energy in pulling against each other.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach this haven of safety it is necessary to pass through\r\na period of transition, in which there are some formidable difficulties.\r\nOne of these I may mention by way of illustration.\r\n\r\nIn creating parliamentary institutions of any kind the Government could\r\nhardly leave intact the present system of allowing the police to arrest\r\nwithout a proper warrant, and send into exile without trial, any one\r\nsuspected of revolutionary designs. On this point all the Opposition\r\ngroups are agreed, and all consequently put forward prominently the\r\ndemand for the inviolability of person and domicile. To grant such a\r\nconcession seems a very simple and easy matter, but any responsible\r\nminister might hesitate to accept such a restriction of his\r\nauthority. We know, he would argue, that the terrorist section of the\r\nSocialist-Revolutionary group, the so-called Militant Organisation,\r\nare very busy preparing bombs, and the police, even with the extensive,\r\nill-defined powers which they at present possess, have the greatest\r\ndifficulty in preventing the use of such objectionable instruments\r\nof political warfare. Would not the dynamiters and throwers of\r\nhand-grenades utilise a relaxation of police supervision, as they did in\r\nthe time of Louis Melikof,* for carrying out their nefarious designs?\r\n\r\n     * Vide supra, p. 569.\r\n\r\nI have no desire to conceal or minimise such dangers, but I believe they\r\nare temporary and by no means so great as the dangers of the only other\r\nalternatives--energetic repression and listless inactivity. Terrorism\r\nand similar objectionable methods of political warfare are symptoms of\r\nan abnormal, unhealthy state of society, and would doubtless disappear\r\nin Russia, as they have disappeared in other countries, with the\r\nconditions which produced them. If the terrorists continued to exist\r\nunder a more liberal regime, they would be much less formidable, because\r\nthey would lose the half-concealed sympathy which they at present enjoy.\r\n\r\nPolitical assassinations may occasionally take place under the most\r\ndemocratic governments, as the history of the United States proves,\r\nbut terrorism as a system is to be found only in countries where the\r\npolitical power is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals; and\r\nit sometimes happens that irresponsible persons are exposed to terrorist\r\nattacks. We have an instance of this at present in St. Petersburg.\r\nThe reluctance of the Emperor to adopt at once a Liberal programme is\r\ncommonly attributed to the influence of two members of the Imperial\r\nfamily, the Empress Dowager and the Grand Duke Vladimir. This is a\r\nmistake. Neither of these personages is so reactionary as is generally\r\nsupposed, and their political views, whatever they may be, have no\r\nappreciable influence on the course of affairs. If the Empress Dowager\r\nhad possessed the influence so often ascribed to her, M. Plehve would\r\nnot have remained so long in power. As for the Grand Duke Vladimir, he\r\nis not in favour, and for nearly two years he has never been consulted\r\non political matters. The so-called Grand Ducal party of which he is\r\nsupposed to be the leader, is a recently invented fiction. When in\r\ndifficulties the Emperor may consult individually some of his near\r\nrelatives, but there is no coherent group to which the term party could\r\nproperly be applied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Autocratic Power has decided on a definite line of\r\naction, it is to be hoped that a strong man will be found to take the\r\ndirection of affairs. In Russia, as in other autocratically governed\r\ncountries, strong men in the political sense of the term are extremely\r\nrare, and when they do appear as a lusus naturae they generally take\r\ntheir colour from their surroundings, and are of the authoritative,\r\ndictatorial type. During recent years only two strong men have come to\r\nthe front in the Russian official world. The one was M. Plehve, who\r\nwas nothing if not authoritative and dictatorial, and who is no longer\r\navailable for experiments in repression or constitutionalism. The other\r\nis M. Witte. As an administrator under an autocratic regime he has\r\ndisplayed immense ability and energy, but it does not follow that he is\r\na statesman capable of piloting the ship into calm waters, and he is not\r\nlikely to have an opportunity of making the attempt, for he does not--to\r\nstate the case mildly--possess the full confidence of his august master.\r\n\r\nEven if a strong man, enjoying fully the Imperial confidence, could be\r\nfound, the problem would not be thereby completely and satisfactorily\r\nsolved, because an autocrat, who is the Lord\u0027s Anointed, cannot delegate\r\nhis authority to a simple mortal without losing something of the\r\nsemi-religious halo and the prestige on which his authority rests.\r\nWhile a roi faineant may fulfil effectively all the essential duties of\r\nsovereignty, an autocrate faineant is an absurdity.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, it is idle to speculate as to the future. All\r\nwe can do is to await patiently the development of events, and in all\r\nprobability it is the unexpected that will happen.\r\n\r\nThe reader doubtless feels that I am offering a very lame and impotent\r\nconclusion, and I must confess that I am conscious of this feeling\r\nmyself, but I think I may fairly plead extenuating circumstances.\r\nHappily for my peace of mind I am a mere observer who is not called upon\r\nto invent a means of extricating Russia from her difficult position.\r\nFor that arduous task there are already brave volunteers enough in\r\nthe field. All I have to do is to explain as clearly as I can the\r\ncomplicated problem to be solved. Nor do I feel it any part of my duty\r\nto make predictions. I believe I am pretty well acquainted with the\r\nsituation at the present moment, but what it may be a few weeks hence,\r\nwhen the words I am now writing issue from the press, I do not profess\r\nto foresee."
