It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

And further, by chance, it happened that the two\r\nyoung men had first met at the gateway to the campus, one coming\r\nfrom the East and the other from the West, and having exchanged the\r\ncourtesies of stranger greeting, they had walked, side by side, up the\r\nlong avenue to the foot of the slope. Together, they had climbed the\r\nbroad flight of steps leading up to the imposing doorway of Sunrise,\r\nwith the great letter S carved in stone relief above it; and, after\r\npausing a moment to take in the matchless wonder of the landscape over\r\nwhich old Sunrise keeps watch, the college portal had swung open, and\r\nthe two had entered at the same time.\r\n\r\nInside the doorway the Professor and the country boy were impressed,\r\nthough in differing degrees, with the massive beauty of the rotunda over\r\nwhich the stained glass of the dome hangs a halo of mellow radiance.\r\nInvoluntarily they lifted their eyes toward this crown of light and\r\nsaw far above them, wrought in dainty coloring, the design of the great\r\nState Seal of Kansas, with its inscription They saw something more in\r\nthat upward glance. On the stairway of the rotunda, Elinor Wream,\r\nthe niece of the president of Sunrise College, was leaning over the\r\nbalustrade, looking at them with curious eyes. Her smile of recognition\r\nas she caught sight of Professor Burgess, gave place to an expression of\r\nhalf-concealed ridicule, as she glanced down at Vic Burleigh, the big,\r\nheavy-boned young fellow, so grotesquely impossible to the harmony of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nAs the two men dropped their eyes, they encountered the upturned face\r\nof a plainly dressed girl coming up the stairs from the basement, with a\r\nbig feather duster in her hand. It was old Bond Saxon\u0027s daughter Dennie,\r\nwho was earning her tuition by keeping the library and offices in\r\norder. As if to even matters, it was Vic Burleigh who caught a token of\r\nrecognition now, while the young Professor was surveyed with fearless\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nAll this took only a moment of time. Long afterward these two men knew\r\nthat in that moment an antagonism was born between them that must fight\r\nitself out through the length of days. But now, Dr. Lloyd Fenneben, Dean\r\nof Sunrise, known to students and alumni alike as “Dean Funnybone,” was\r\ngrasping each man\u0027s hand with a cordial grip and measuring each with a\r\nkeen glance from piercing black eyes, as he bade them equal welcome.\r\n\r\nAnd here all likeness of conditions ends for these two. Days come and\r\ngo, moons wax and wane, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and\r\nwinter glide fourfold through their appointed seasons, before the two\r\nyoung men stand side by side on a common level again. And the events\r\nof these changing seasons ring in so rapidly, and in so inevitable a\r\nfashion, that the whole cycle runs like a real story along the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIFE\r\n\r\n _With the first faint note out of distance flung,\r\n     From the moment man hears the siren call\r\n     Of Victory\u0027s bugle, which sounds for all,\r\n     To his inner self the promise is made\r\n     To weary not, rest not, but all unafraid\r\n Press on--till for him the paean be sung.\r\n\r\n The song for the victor is sweet, is sweet--\r\n     Yet to the music a memory clings\r\n     Of trampled nestlings, of broken wings,\r\n And of faces white with defeat!_\r\n                         --ELIZABETH D. PRESTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. “DEAN FUNNYBONE”\r\n\r\n     _Nature they say, doth dote,\r\n     And cannot make a man\r\n     Save on some worn-out plan,\r\n     Repeating us by rote:\r\n For him her Old-World moulds aside she threw,\r\n    .............................\r\n With stuff untainted,\r\n shaped a hero new_.--LOWELL\r\n\r\nDR. LLOYD FENNEBEN, Dean of Sunrise College, had migrated to the Walnut\r\nValley with the founding of the school here. In fact, he had brought the\r\ncollege with him when he came hither, and had set it, as a light not to\r\nbe hidden, on the crest of that high ridge that runs east of the little\r\ntown of Lagonda Ledge. And the town eagerly took the new school to\r\nitself; at once its pride and profit. Yea, the town rises and sets with\r\nSunrise. When the first gleam of morning, hidden by the east ridge from\r\nthe Walnut Valley, glints redly from the south windows of the college\r\ndome in the winter time, and from the north windows in the summer time,\r\nthe town bestirs; itself, and the factory whistles blow. And when the\r\nlast crimson glory of evening puts a halo of flame about the brow of\r\nSunrise, the people know that out beyond the Walnut River the day is\r\npassing, and the pearl-gray mantle of twilight is deepening to velvety\r\ndarkness on the wide, quiet prairie lands.\r\n\r\nLagonda Ledge was a better place after the college settled permanently\r\nabove it. Some improvident citizens took a new hold on life, while some\r\nundesirables who had lived in lawless infamy skulked across the Walnut\r\nand disappeared in that rough picturesque region full of uncertainties\r\nthat lies behind the west bluffs of the stream. All this, after the\r\ncollege had found an abiding place on the limestone ridge. For Sunrise\r\nhad been a migratory bird before reaching the outskirts of Lagonda\r\nLedge. As a fulfillment of prophecy, it had arisen from the visions and\r\npockets of some Boston scholars, and it had come to the West and was\r\nmade flesh--or stone--and dwelt among men on the outskirts of a booming\r\nyoung Kansas town.\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben was just out of Harvard when Dr. Joshua Wream, his\r\nstep-brother, many years his senior, professor of all the dead languages\r\never left unburied, had put a considerable fortune into his hands, and\r\ninto his brain the dream of a life-work--even the building of a great\r\nuniversity in the West. For the Wreams were a stubborn, self-willed,\r\nbookish breed, who held that salvation of souls could come only through\r\npossession of a college diploma. Young Fenneben had come to Kansas with\r\nall his youth and health and money, with high ideals and culture and\r\nambition for success and dreams of honor--and, hidden deep down, the\r\nmemory of some sort of love affair, but that was his own business. With\r\nthis dream of a new Harvard on the western prairies, he had burned his\r\nbridges behind him, and in an unbusiness-like way, relying too much upon\r\na board of trustees whom he had interested in his plans he had eagerly\r\nbegun his task, struggling to adapt the West to his university model,\r\nmeasuring all men and means by the scholarly rule of his Alma Mater.\r\nBeing a young man, he took himself full seriously, and it was a\r\ntremendous blow to his sense of dignity when the youthful Jayhawkers at\r\nthe outset dubbed him “Dean Funnybone”--a name he was never to lose.\r\n\r\nHis college flourished so amazingly that another boom town, farther\r\ninland, came across the prairie one day, and before the eyes of the\r\nyoung dean bought it of the money-loving trustees--body and soul and\r\ndean--and packed it off as the Plains Indians would carry off a white\r\ncaptive, miles away to the westward. Plumped down in a big frame\r\nbarracks in the public square of twenty acres in the middle of this new\r\ntown, at once real estate dealers advertised the place as the literary\r\ncenter of Kansas; while lots in straggling additions far away across the\r\nprairie draws were boomed as “college flats within walking distance of\r\nthe university.”\r\n\r\nIn this new setting Lloyd Fenneben started again to build up what had\r\nbeen so recklessly torn down. But it was slow doing, and in a downcast\r\nhour the head of the board of trustees took council with the young dean.\r\n\r\n“Funnybone, that\u0027s what the boys call you, ain\u0027t it?” The name had come\r\nalong over the prairie with the school. “Funnybone, you are as likely\r\na man as ever escaped from Boston. But you\u0027re never going to build the\r\nEast into the West, no more\u0027n you could ram the West into the Atlantic\r\nseaboard states. My advice to you is to get yourself into the West for\r\ngood and drop your higher learnin\u0027 notions, and be one of us, or beat it\r\nback to where you came from quick.”\r\n\r\nDean Fenneben listened as a man who hears the reading of his own\r\nobituary.\r\n\r\n“You\u0027ve come out to Kansas with beautiful dreams,” the bluff trustee\r\ncontinued. “Drop \u0027em! You\u0027re too late for the New England pioneers who\r\ncome West. They\u0027ve had their day and passed on. The thing for you to do\r\nis to commercialize yourself right away. Go to buyin\u0027 and sellin\u0027 dirt.\r\nIt\u0027s all a man can do for Kansas now. Just boom her real estate.”\r\n\r\n“All a man can do for Kansas!” Fenneben repeated slowly.\r\n\r\n“Sure, and I\u0027ll tell you something more. This town is busted, absolutely\r\nbusted. I, and a few others, brought this college here as an investment\r\nfor ourselves. It ain\u0027t paid us, and we\u0027ve throwed the thing over. I\u0027ve\r\njust closed a deal with a New Jersey syndicate that gets me rid of every\r\nfoot of ground I own here. The county-seat\u0027s goin\u0027 to be eighteen\r\nmiles south, and it will be kingdom come, a\u0027most, before the railroad\r\nextension is any nearer \u0027n that. Let your university go, and come with\r\nme. I can make you rich in six months. In six weeks the coyotes will be\r\nhowlin\u0027 through your college halls, and the prairie dogs layin\u0027 out\r\na townsite on the campus, and the rattlesnakes coilin\u0027 round the\r\ndoorsteps. Will you come, Funnybone?”\r\n\r\nThe trustee waited for an answer. While he waited, the soul of the young\r\ndean found itself.\r\n\r\n“Funnybone!” Lloyd repeated. “I guess that\u0027s just what I need--a funny\r\nbone in my anatomy to help me to see the humor of this thing. Go with\r\nyou and give up my college? Build up the prosperity of a commonwealth\r\nby starving its mind! No, no; I\u0027ll go on with the thing I came here to\r\ndo--so help me God!”\r\n\r\n“You\u0027ll soon go to the devil, you and your old school. Good-by!” And the\r\ntrustee left him.\r\n\r\nA month later, Dean Fenneben sat alone in his university barracks and\r\nsaw the prairie dogs making the dust fly as they digged about what had\r\nbeen intended for a flower bed on the campus. Then he packed up his\r\nmeager library and other college equipments and walked ten miles across\r\nthe plains to hire a man with a team to haul them away. The teamster had\r\nmuch ado to drive his half-bridle-wise Indian ponies near enough to\r\nthe university doorway to load his wagon. Before the threshold a huge\r\nrattlesnake lay coiled, already disputing any human claim to this\r\nkingdom of the wild.\r\n\r\nDiscouraging as all this must have been to Fenneben, when he started\r\naway from the deserted town he smiled joyously as a man who sees his\r\nroad fair before him.\r\n\r\n“I might go back to Cambridge and poke about after the dead languages\r\nuntil my brother passes on, and then drop into his chair in the\r\nuniversity,” he said to himself, “but the trustee was right. I can never\r\nbuild the East into the West. But I can learn from the East how to bring\r\nthe West into its own kingdom. I can make the dead languages serve me\r\nthe better to speak the living words here. And if I can do that, I\r\nmay earn a Master\u0027s Degree from my Alma Mater without the writing of a\r\nlearned thesis to clinch it. But whether I win honor or I am forgotten,\r\nthis shall be my life-work--out on these Kansas prairies, to till a soil\r\nthat shall grow MEN AND WOMEN.”\r\n\r\nFor the next three years Dean Fenneben and his college flourished on\r\nthe borders of a little frontier town, if that can be called flourishing\r\nwhich uses up time, and money, and energy, Christian patience, and\r\ndogged persistence. Then an August prairie fire, sweeping up from the\r\nsouthwest, leaped the narrow fire-guard about the one building and\r\nburned up everything there, except Dean Fenneben. Six years, and nothing\r\nto show for his work on the outside. Inside, the six years\u0027 stay\r\nin Kansas had seen the making over of a scholarly dreamer into a\r\nhard-headed, far-seeing, masterful man, who took the West as he found\r\nit, but did not leave it so. Not he! All the power of higher learning he\r\nstill held supreme. But by days of hard work in the college halls, and\r\nnights of meditation out in the silent sanctuary spaces of the prairies\r\nround about him, he had been learning how to compute the needs of men as\r\nthe angel with the golden reed computed the walls and gates of the New\r\nJerusalem--_according to the measure of a man_.\r\n\r\nSuch was Dean Fenneben who came after six years of service to the little\r\ntown of Lagonda Ledge to plant Sunrise on the crest above the Walnut\r\nValley beyond reach of prairie fire or bursting boom. Firm set as the\r\nlimestone of its foundations, he reared here a college that should live,\r\nfor that its builder himself with his feet on the ground and his face\r\ntoward the light had learned the secret of living.\r\n\r\nMiles away across the valley, the dome of Sunrise could be seen by day.\r\nBy night, the old college lantern at first, and later the studding of\r\nelectric lights, made a beacon for all the open countryside. But if\r\nthe wayfarer, by chance or choice, turned his footsteps to those rocky\r\nbluffs and glens beyond the Walnut River, wherefrom the town of Lagonda\r\nLedge takes its name, he lost the guiding ray from the hilltop and\r\ngroped in black and dangerous ways where darkness rules.\r\n\r\nAbove the south turret hung the Sunrise bell, whose resonant voice\r\nfilled the whole valley, and what the sight of Sunrise failed to do for\r\nLagonda Ledge, the sound of the bell accomplished. The first class to\r\nenter the school nicknamed its head “Dean Funnybone,” but this gave him\r\nno shock any more. He had learned the humor of life now, the spirit of\r\nthe open land where the view is broad to broadening souls.\r\n\r\nAnd it was to the hand of Dean Fenneben that Professor Vincent Burgess,\r\nA.B., Greek instructor from Boston, and Vic Burleigh, the big country\r\nboy from a claim beyond the Walnut, came on a September day; albeit, the\r\none had his head in the clouds, while the other\u0027s feet were clogged with\r\nthe grass roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. POTTER\u0027S CLAY\r\n\r\n _This clay, well mixed with marl and sand,\r\n Follows the motion of my hand,\r\n For some must follow and some command,\r\n     Though all are made of clay_.\r\n                         --LONGFELLOW\r\n\r\nTHE afternoon sunshine was flooding the September landscape with molten\r\ngold, filling the valley with intense heat, and rippling back in warm\r\nwaves from the crest of the ridge. Dean Fenneben\u0027s study in the south\r\ntower of Sunrise looked out on the new heaven and the new earth, every\r\nday-dawn created afresh for his eyes; for truly, the Walnut Valley in\r\nany mood needs only eyes that see to be called a goodly land. And it\r\nwas because of the magnificent vista, unfolding in woodland, and winding\r\nriver, and fertile field, and far golden prairie--it was because of the\r\nunconscious power of all this upon the student mind, that Dr. Fenneben\r\nhad set his college up here.\r\n\r\nOn this September afternoon, the Dean sat looking out on this land of\r\npure delight a-quiver in the late summer sunshine. Nature had done well\r\nby Lloyd Fenneben. His height was commanding, and he was slender, rather\r\nthan heavy, with ease of movement as if the play of every muscle was\r\nnerved to harmony. His heavy black hair was worn a trifle long on the\r\nupper part of his head and fell in masses above his forehead. His eyes\r\nwere black and keen under heavy black brows. Every feature was strong\r\nand massive, but saved from sternness by a genial kindliness and sense\r\nof humor. Whoever came into his presence felt that magnetic power only a\r\nking of his kind can possess.\r\n\r\nLong the Dean sat gazing at the gleaming landscape and the sleepy town\r\nbeyond the campus and the pigeons circling gracefully above a little\r\ncottage, hidden by trees, up the river.\r\n\r\n“A wonderful region!” he murmured. “If that old white-haired brother of\r\nmine digging about the roots of Greek and Sanscrit back in Harvard could\r\nonly see all this, maybe he might understand why I choose to stay here\r\nwith my college instead of tying up with a university back East. But,\r\nmaybe not. We are only step-brothers. He is old enough to be my father,\r\nand with all his knowledge of books he could never read men. However, he\r\nsent me West with a fat pocketbook in the interest of higher education.\r\nI hope I\u0027ve invested well. And our magnificent group of buildings up\r\nhere and our broad-acred campus, together with our splendid enrollment\r\nof students justify my hope. Strange, I have never known whose money\r\nI was using. Not Joshua Wream\u0027s, I know that. Money is nothing to the\r\nWreams except as it endows libraries, builds colleges, and extends\r\nuniversities. Too scholarly for these prairies, all of them! Too\r\nscholarly!”\r\n\r\nThe Dean\u0027s eyes were fixed on a tiny shaft of blue smoke rising steadily\r\nfrom the rough country in the valley beyond Lagonda Ledge, but his mind\r\nwas still on his brother.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Joshua Wream, D.D., Litt.D., LL.D., etc.! He has taken all the\r\ndegrees conferable, except the degree of human insight.” Something\r\nbehind the strong face sent a line of pathos into it with the thought.\r\n“He has piled up enough for me to look after this fall, anyhow. It was\r\nbad enough for that niece of ours to be left a penniless orphan with\r\nonly the two uncles to look after her and both of us bachelors. And now,\r\nafter he has been shaping Elinor Wream\u0027s life until she is ready for\r\ncollege, he sends her out here to me, frankly declaring that she is too\r\nmuch for him. She always was.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to a letter lying on the table beside him, a smile playing\r\nabout the frown on his countenance.\r\n\r\n“He hopes I can do better by Elinor than he has been able to do, because\r\nhe\u0027s never had a wife nor child to teach him,” he continued, giving word\r\nto his thought. “A fine time for me to begin! No wife nor child has ever\r\ntaught me anything. He says she is a good girl, a beautiful girl with\r\nonly two great faults. Only two! She\u0027s lucky. \u0027One\u0027”--Fenneben glanced\r\nmore closely at the letter--“\u0027is her self-will.\u0027 I never knew a Wream\r\nthat didn\u0027t have that fault. \u0027And the other\u0027”--the frown drove back the\r\nsmile now--“\u0027is her notion of wealth. Nobody but a rich man could ever\r\nwin her hand.\u0027 She who has been simply reared, with all the Wream creed\r\nthat higher education is the final end of man, is set with a Wream-like\r\nfirmness in her hatred of poverty, her eagerness for riches and luxury.\r\nAnd to add to all this responsibility he must send me his pet Greek\r\nscholar, Vincent Burgess, to try out as a professor in Sunrise. A\r\nBurgess, of all men in the world, to be sent to me! Of course this\r\nyoung man knows nothing of my affairs but is my brother too old and\r\ntoo scholarly to remember what I\u0027ve tried a thousand times to forget? I\r\nthought the old wound had healed by this time.”\r\n\r\nA wave of sadness swept the strong man\u0027s face. “I\u0027ve asked Burgess to\r\ncome up at three. I must find out what material is sent here for my\r\nshaping. It is a president\u0027s business to shape well, and I must do my\r\nbest, God help me!”\r\n\r\nA shadow darkened Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s face, and his black eyes held a\r\nstrange light. He stared vacantly at the landscape until he suddenly\r\nnoted the slender wavering pillar of smoke beyond the Walnut.\r\n\r\n“There are no houses in those glens and hidden places,” he thought. “I\r\nwonder what fire is under that smoke on a day like this. It is a far cry\r\nfrom the top of this ridge to the bottom of that half-tamed region down\r\nthere. One may see into three counties here, but it is rough traveling\r\nacross the river by day, and worse by night.”\r\n\r\nThe bell above the south turret chimed the hour of three as Vincent\r\nBurgess entered the study.\r\n\r\n“Take this seat by the window,” Dr. Fenneben said with a genial smile\r\nand a handclasp worth remembering. “You can see an Empire from this\r\npoint, if you care to look out.”\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess sat at ease in any presence. He had the face of a\r\nscholar, and the manners of a gentleman. But he gave no sign that he\r\ncared to view the empire that lay beyond the window.\r\n\r\n“We are to be co-workers for some time, Burgess. May I ask you why you\r\nchose to come to Kansas?”\r\n\r\nFenneben came straight to the purpose of the interview. This keen-eyed,\r\nbusiness-like man seemed to Burgess very unlike old Dr. Wream, whom\r\neverybody at Harvard loved and anybody could deceive. But to the direct\r\nquestion he answered directly and concisely.\r\n\r\n“I came to study types, to acquire geographical breadth, to have\r\nseclusion, that I may pursue more profound research.”\r\n\r\nThere was a play of light in Dr. Fenneben\u0027s eyes.\r\n\r\n“You must judge for yourself of the value of Sunrise and Lagonda Ledge\r\nfor seclusion. But we make a specialty of geographical breadth out here.\r\nAs to types, they assay fairly well to the ton, these Jayhawkers do.”\r\n\r\n“What are Jayhawkers, Doctor?” Burgess queried.\r\n\r\n“Yonder is one specimen,” Fenneben answered, pointing toward the window.\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess, looking out, saw Vic Burleigh leaping up the broad\r\nsteps from the level campus, a giant fellow, fully six feet tall.\r\nThe swing of strength, void of grace, was in his motion. His face was\r\ngypsy-brown under a crop of sunburned auburn hair. A stiff new derby\r\nhat was set bashfully on a head set unabashed on broad shoulders. The\r\nstore-mark of the ready-made was on his clothing, and it was clear that\r\nhe was less accustomed to cut stone steps than to springing prairie sod.\r\nClearly he was a real product of the soil.\r\n\r\n“Why, that is the young bumpkin I came in with this morning. I thought\r\nI was striding alongside an elephant in bulk and wild horse in speed,”\r\n Burgess said with a smile.\r\n\r\n“You will have a share in taming him, doubtless,” Dr. Fenneben replied.\r\n“He looks hardly bridle-wise yet. Enter him among your types. I didn\u0027t\r\nget his name this morning, but he interested me at once, as a fellow of\r\ngood blood if not of good manners, and I have asked him to come in here\r\nlater. Some boys must be met on the very threshold of a college if they\r\nare to run safely along the four years.”\r\n\r\n“His name is Burleigh, Victor Burleigh. I remember it because it is not\r\na new name to me. Picture him in a cap and gown at home in a library,\r\nor standing up to receive a Master\u0027s Degree from a university! His kind\r\nleave about the middle of the second semester and revert to the soil,\r\ndon\u0027t they?”\r\n\r\nBurgess laughed pleasantly, and leaned forward to get one more look at\r\nthe country boy, disappearing behind a group of evergreens in the north\r\nangle of the building.\r\n\r\n“They do not always leave so soon as that. You can\u0027t tell the grade of\r\ntimber every time by the bark outside.” There was a deeper tone in Dr.\r\nFenneben\u0027s voice now. “But as to yourself, you had a motive in coming to\r\nKansas, I judge. You can study types anywhere.”\r\n\r\nWhether the young man liked this or not, he answered evenly:\r\n\r\n“I am to give instruction in Greek here at Lagonda Ledge. Beastly name,\r\nisn\u0027t it? Suggestive of rattlesnakes, somehow! I shall spend much time\r\nin study, for I am preparing a comprehensive thesis for my Master\u0027s\r\nDegree. The very barrenness of these dull prairies will keep me close to\r\nmy library for a couple of years.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will do your work well anywhere,” Dr. Fenneben declared. “You\r\nneed not put walls of distances about you for that. I thought you might\r\nhave a more definite purpose in choosing this state, of all places.”\r\n\r\nFenneben\u0027s mind was running back to the days of his own first struggle\r\nfor existence in the West, and his heart went out in sympathy to the\r\nundisciplined young professor.\r\n\r\n“I have a reason, but it is entirely a personal matter.” Burgess was\r\nlooking at the floor now. “Did you know I had a sister once?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” Dr. Fenneben said.\r\n\r\n“She was married and came to Kansas. That was after you left Cambridge,\r\nI suppose. She and her husband are both dead, leaving no children. My\r\nfather was bitterly opposed to her coming out here, and never forgave\r\nher for it. He died recently, making me his heir. I\u0027ve always thought\r\nI\u0027d like to see the state where my sister lived. She died young. She\r\ncould not have been as old as you are, and you are a young man yet,\r\nDoctor. In addition, my father left in my care some trust funds for a\r\nclaimant who also lived in Kansas. He is dead now, but I want to find\r\nout something more definite concerning him. Outside of this, I hope to\r\ndo well here and to succeed to higher places elsewhere, soon. All this\r\npersonal to myself, and worthy, I hope.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Fenneben, who was leaning forward with his elbow on the\r\ntable and his head bowed. His face was hidden and his white fingers were\r\nthrust through the heavy masses of black hair.\r\n\r\n“You will find a great field here in which to work out your success,”\r\n the Dean said at length. “But I must give a word of warning. I tried\r\nonce to reproduce the eastern university here. I learned better. If\r\nKansas is to be your training ground, may I say that the man who opens\r\nhis front door for the first time on the green prairies of the West has\r\nno less to learn than the man who first pitches his tent beside the blue\r\nAtlantic? Don\u0027t say I didn\u0027t show you where to find the blazed trail if\r\nyou get lost from it for a little while.”\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben\u0027s face was charming when he smiled.\r\n\r\n“One other thing I may mention. You know my niece, Elinor? I\u0027ve been out\r\nhere so long, I may need your help in making her feel at home at first.”\r\n\r\nThere was a new light in Burgess\u0027s eyes at the mention of Elinor Wream\u0027s\r\nname.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I know Miss Elinor very well. I shall need her more to make me\r\nfeel at home than she will need me.”\r\n\r\nSomehow the answer was a trifle too quick and smooth to ring right. Dr.\r\nFenneben forgot it in an instant, however, for Elinor Wream herself came\r\nsuddenly into the room, a tall, slender girl, with a face so full of\r\nsunshiny charm that no great defect of character had yet made its mark\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, Uncle Lloyd; I thought you were alone. How do you\r\ndo, Professor Burgess.” She came forward smilingly and offered her hand.\r\n“Makes me homesick for old Cambridge and Uncle Joshua when I see you. I\r\nwant to go down to Lagonda Ledge, and I don\u0027t know the streets at all.\r\nDon\u0027t you want to show me the way?”\r\n\r\n“Can\u0027t you wait for me to do that, Norrie? I have only one more\r\nengagement for the afternoon, and Miss Saxon will be wanting to dust in\r\nhere soon.” Dr. Fenneben looked fondly at his niece, a man to make other\r\nmen jealous, if occasion offered.\r\n\r\n“Please don\u0027t, Miss Elinor,” Vincent Burgess urged. “I shall be\r\ndelighted to explore darkest Kansas with you at any time.”\r\n\r\n“There is no mistaking that look in a man\u0027s eyes,” Dr. Fenneben thought\r\nas he watched the two pass through the rotunda and out of the great\r\nfront door. “I have guessed Joshua\u0027s plan easily enough, but I\u0027ve only\r\nhalf guessed him out. Why did he mention his money matters to me? There\r\nis enough merit in him worth the shaping Sunrise will give him, however,\r\nand I must do a man\u0027s part, anyhow. As for Elinor, there\u0027s a ready-made\r\nmissionary field in her, so Joshua warns me. But he is a poor judge\r\nsometimes. I wish I might have begun with her sooner. I cannot think she\r\nis quite as mercenary as he represents her to be.”\r\n\r\nThrough the window he saw a pretty picture. Outlined against the dark\r\ngreen cedars of the north angle was Professor Burgess, tall, slender,\r\nfair of face, faultless in dress. Beside him was Elinor Wream, all\r\ndainty and sweet and white, from the broad-brimmed hat set jauntily on\r\nher dark hair to the white bows on the instep of her neat little canvas\r\nshoes. A wave of loneliness swept over Dr. Fenneben\u0027s soul as he looked.\r\n\r\n“It must have been a thousand years ago that I was in love and walked in\r\nmy Eden. There are no serpents here as there were in mine.”\r\n\r\nJust then his eyes fell upon the wide stone landing of the campus steps.\r\nAt the same moment Elinor gave a scream of fright. A bull snake, big\r\nand ugly, had crawled half out of the burned grasses of the slope and\r\nstretched itself lazily in the sunshine along the warm stone. It roused\r\nitself at the scream, emitting its hoarse hiss, after the manner of bull\r\nsnakes. Elinor clutched at her companion\u0027s arm, pale with fear.\r\n\r\n“Kill it! Kill it!” she cried, trying to force her slender white parasol\r\ninto his hand.\r\n\r\nBefore he could move, Vic Burleigh leaped out from behind the cedars,\r\nand, picking up a sharp-edged bit of limestone, tipped his hand\r\ndexterously and sent it clean as a knife cut across the space. It struck\r\nthe snake just below the head, half severing it from the body. Another\r\nleap and Burleigh had kicked the whole writhing mass--it would have\r\nmeasured five feet--off the stone into the sunflower stalks and long\r\ngrasses of the steep slope.\r\n\r\n“How did you ever dare?” Elinor asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he\u0027s not poison; he just doesn\u0027t belong up here.”\r\n\r\nThe bluntness of timidity was in Vic\u0027s answer, but the strength and\r\nmusical depth of his resonant voice was almost startling.\r\n\r\n“There is no Eden without a serpent, Miss Elinor,” Professor Burgess\r\nsaid lightly.\r\n\r\n“Nor a serpent without some sort of Eden built around it. The thing\u0027s\r\nmate will be along after it pretty soon. Look out for it down there. The\r\nbest place to catch it is right behind its ears,” came the boy\u0027s quick\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nBurleigh looked back defiantly at Burgess as he disappeared indoors. And\r\nthe antagonism born in the meeting of these two men in the morning took\r\non a tiny degree of strength in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n“What a wonderful voice, Vincent. It makes one want to hear it again,”\r\n Elinor exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and what an overgrown pile of awkwardness. It makes one hope never\r\nto see it again,” her companion responded.\r\n\r\n“But he killed that snake in a way that looked expert to me,” Elinor\r\ninsisted.\r\n\r\n“My dear Miss Elinor, he was probably born in some Kansas cabin and has\r\npracticed killing snakes all his life. Not a very elevating feat. Let\u0027s\r\ngo down and explore Lagonda Ledge now before the other snake comes in\r\nfor the coroner\u0027s inquest.”\r\n\r\nAnd the two passed down the stone steps to the shady level campus and on\r\nto the town beyond it.\r\n\r\n“You are hard on snakes, Burleigh,” Dr. Fenneben said as he welcomed the\r\ncountry boy into his study. “A bull snake is a harmless creature, and he\r\nis the farmer\u0027s friend.”\r\n\r\n“Let him stay on the farm then. I hate him. He\u0027s no friend of mine,” Vic\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nHe was overflowing the chair recently graced by Professor Burgess and\r\nclutching his derby as if it might escape and leave him bareheaded\r\nforever. His face had a dogged expression and his glance was stern. Yet\r\nhis direct words and the deep richness of his voice put him outside of\r\nthe class of commonplace beginners.\r\n\r\n“Are you fond of killing things?” the Dean asked.\r\n\r\nThe ruddy color deepened in Vic Burleigh\u0027s brown cheek, but the\r\nsteadfast gaze of his eyes and the firm lines of his mouth told the\r\nhead of Sunrise something of what he would find in the sturdy young\r\nJayhawker.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” came the blunt answer. “I\u0027ve always lived on a Kansas\r\nclaim. Unless you know what that means you might not understand--how\r\nhard a life”--Vic stopped abruptly and squeezed the rim of his derby.\r\n\r\n“Never mind. We take only face value here. Fine view from that window,”\r\n and Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s genial smile began to win the heart of the country\r\nboy as most young hearts were won to him.\r\n\r\nBurleigh leaned toward the window, forgetful of the chair arms he had\r\nstriven to subdue, the late afternoon sunlight falling on his brown face\r\nand glinting in his auburn hair.\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s as pretty as paradise,” he said, simply. “There\u0027s nothing like our\r\nKansas prairies.”\r\n\r\n“You come from the plains out west, I hear. How long do you plan to stay\r\nhere, Burleigh?” Dr. Fenneben asked.\r\n\r\n“Four years if I can make it go. I\u0027ve got a little schooling and I know\r\nhow to herd cattle. I need more than this, if I am only a country boy.”\r\n\r\n“Who pays for your schooling, yourself, or your father?” Fenneben\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n“I have no father nor mother now.”\r\n\r\n“You are willing to work four years to get a diploma from Sunrise? It is\r\nhard work; all the harder if you have not had much schooling before it.”\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m willing to work, and I\u0027d like to have the diploma for it,” Vic\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“Burleigh, did you notice the letter S carved in the stone above the\r\ndoor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; I suppose it stands for Sunrise?”\r\n\r\n“It does. But with the years it will take on new meanings for you.\r\nWhen you have learned all these meanings you will be ready for your\r\ndiploma--and more. You will be far on your way to the winning of a\r\nMaster\u0027s Degree.”\r\n\r\nVic\u0027s eyes widened with a sort of child-like simplicity. He forgot his\r\nhat and the chair arms, and Dr. Fenneben noted for the first time that\r\nhis golden-brown eyes matching his auburn hair were shaded by long black\r\nlashes, the kind artists rave about, and arched over with black brows.\r\n\r\n“His eyes and voice are all right,” was the Dean\u0027s mental comment.\r\n“There\u0027s good blood in his veins, I\u0027ll wager.”\r\n\r\nBut before he could speak further the shrill scream of a frightened\r\nchild came from the campus below the ridge. At the cry Vic Burleigh\r\nsprang to his feet, upsetting his chair, and without stopping to pick it\r\nup, he rushed from the building.\r\n\r\nAs he tore down the long flight of steps, Lloyd Fenneben caught sight of\r\na child on the level campus running toward him as fast as its fat little\r\nlegs could toddle. Two minutes later Vic Burleigh was back in the study,\r\npanting and hot, with the little one clinging to his neck.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, please,” Vic said as he lifted the fallen chair. “I\r\nforgot all about Bug down there, and the widow Bull”--he gave a\r\nhalf-smile--“was wriggling around trying to find her mate, and scared\r\nhim. He\u0027s too little to be left alone, anyhow.”\r\n\r\nBug was a sturdy, stubby three-year-old, or less, dimpled and brown,\r\nwith big dark eyes and a tangle of soft little red-brown ringlets. As\r\nVic seated himself, Bug perched on the arm of the chair inside of the\r\nbig boy\u0027s encircling arm.\r\n\r\n“Who is your friend? Is he your brother?” asked the Dean.\r\n\r\n“No. He\u0027s no relation. I don\u0027t know anything about him, except that his\r\nname is Buler. Bug Buler, he says.”\r\n\r\nLittle Bug put up a chubby brown hand loving-wise to Vic Burleigh\u0027s\r\nbrown cheek, and, looking straight at Dr. Fenneben with wide serious\r\neyes, he asked,\r\n\r\n“Is you dood to Vic?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” replied the Dean.\r\n\r\n“Nen, I like you fornever,” Bug declared, shutting his lips so tightly\r\nthat his checks puffed.\r\n\r\n“How do you happen to have this child here, Burleigh?” questioned\r\nFenneben.\r\n\r\n“Because he\u0027s got nobody else to look after him,” answered Vic.\r\n\r\n“How about an orphan asylum?”\r\n\r\nVic looked down at the little fellow cuddled against his arm, and every\r\nfeature of his stern face softened.\r\n\r\n“Will it make any difference about him if I get my lessons, sir? I\r\ncan\u0027t let Bug go now. We are the limit for each other--neither of us\r\ngot anybody else. I take care of him, but he keeps me from getting too\r\ncoarse and rough. Every fellow needs something innocent and good about\r\nhim sometimes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! Keep him if you want him. But would you mind telling me about\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“I\u0027d rather not now,” Burleigh said, quietly, and Lloyd Fenneben knew\r\nwhen to drop a subject.\r\n\r\n“Then I\u0027m through with you for today, Burleigh. I must let Miss Saxon\r\nhave my room now. Come here whenever you like, and bring Bug if you care\r\nto.”\r\n\r\nSunrise students always left Dr. Fenneben\u0027s study with a little more\r\nof self-respect than when they entered it; richer, not so much from the\r\nword as from the spirit of the head of Sunrise. Victor Burleigh with\r\nlittle Bug Buler\u0027s fat fist clasped in his big, hard hand walked out\r\nof the college door that afternoon with the unconscious baptism of the\r\nstudent upon him, the dim sense of a fellowship with a scholarly master\r\nof books and of men.\r\n\r\nBack in his study Lloyd Fenneben sat looking out once more at the Empire\r\nthat meant nothing but dreary distances to the scholarly professor of\r\nGreek, and seemed a paradise to the untrained young fellow from the\r\nprairies.\r\n\r\n“I see my stint of cloth for the day,” he murmured. “A college professor\r\nin the making who has much to unlearn; a crude young giant who is fond\r\nof killing things, and cares for helpless children; and a beautiful,\r\nwilful, characterless girl to be shown into her womanly heritage. The\r\nclay is ready. It is the potter whose hands need skill. Victor Burleigh!\r\nVictor Burleigh! There\u0027s my greatest problem of all three. He has the\r\nstrength of a Titan in those arms, and the passion of a tiger behind\r\nthose innocent yellow eyes. God keep me on the hilltop nor let my feet\r\nonce get into the dark and dangerous ways!”\r\n\r\nHe looked long at the landscape radiant under the level rays of splendor\r\nstreaming from the low afternoon sun.\r\n\r\n“I wonder who built that fire, and what that pillar of smoke meant this\r\nafternoon. The mystery of our lives hangs some token in each day.”\r\n\r\nThe shadows were gathering in the Walnut Valley, the pigeons about the\r\ncottage up the river, were in their cotes now, the heat of the day was\r\nover, and with one more look at the far peaceful prairies Dr. Lloyd\r\nFenneben closed his study door and passed out into the cool September\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. PIGEON PLACE\r\n\r\n _Strange is the wind and the tide,\r\n The heavens eternally wide;\r\n Less fathomed, this life at my side_.\r\n                    --W. H. SIMPSON\r\n\r\nTHE Sunrise rotunda was ringing with a chorus from three hundred throats\r\nas three hundred students poured out of doors, and over-flowed the ridge\r\nand spilled down the broad steps, making a babel of musical tongues;\r\nwhile fitting itself to every catchy college air known to Sunrise came\r\nthe noisy refrain:\r\n\r\n\r\n          Rah for Funnybone!\r\n          Rah for Funnybone!\r\n          Rah for Funnybone!\r\n          _Rah!_ RAH! RAH!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain it was repeated, swelling along the ridge and floating wide away\r\nover the Walnut Valley. Nor was there a climax of exuberance until\r\nthe appearance of Dr. Lloyd Fenneben himself, with his tall figure\r\nand striking presence outlined against the gray stone columns of the\r\nveranda. All this because it was mid-October, a heaven-made autumn day\r\nin Kansas, with its gracious warmth and bracing breath; with the Indian\r\nsummer haze in shimmering amethyst and gold overhanging the land; and\r\nthe Walnut Valley, gorgeous in the glow of the October frost-fires,\r\nwinding down between broad seas of rainbow-radiant prairies. And all\r\nthis gladness and grandeur, by the decree of Dr. Fenneben, was given\r\nin fee simple to these three hundred young people for the hours of one\r\nperfect day--their annual autumn holiday. No wonder they filled the\r\nair with shouts. And before the singing had ceased the crowd broke into\r\ngroups by natural selection, and the holiday was begun.\r\n\r\nWhatever bounds of time Nature may give to the seed in which to become\r\na plant, or to the grub to become a butterfly, there is no set limit\r\nwherein the country-bred boy may bloom into a full-fledged college\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nSeven weeks after Vic Burleigh had come alongside the Greek Professor\r\ninto Sunrise, found the quick marvelous change from the timid,\r\nuntrained, overgrown young giant into a leader of his clan, the pride of\r\nthe Freshman, the terror of the Sophomores, the dramatic interest of\r\nthe classroom, and the hope of Sunrise on the football gridiron. His\r\nstore-made clothes had a jaunty carelessness of fit. The tan had left\r\nhis cheek. His auburn hair had lost its sun-burn. His powerful physique,\r\nthe charm of his deep voice, the singular beauty of his wide open\r\ngolden-brown eyes, with their long black lashes lighting up his rugged\r\nface, gave to him an attractive personality.\r\n\r\nYet to Lloyd Fenneben, who saw below the surface, Victor Burleigh was\r\nonly at the beginning of things. Something of the tiger light in the\r\nbrown eyes, the pride in brute strength, the blunt justice lacking the\r\nfiner sense of mercy, showed how wide yet was the distance between the\r\nman and the gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Fenneben returned to his study after the hilarious\r\ndemonstration he found Dennie Saxon busy with the little film of dust\r\nthat comes in overnight. Old Bond Saxon, Dennie\u0027s father, had been one\r\nof the improvident of Lagonda Ledge who took a new lease on a livelihood\r\nwith the advent of Sunrise. From being a dissipated old fellow drifting\r\ntoward pauperism, he became the proprietor of a respectable boarding\r\nhouse for students, doing average well. At rare intervals, however, he\r\nlapsed into his old ways. During such occasions he kept to the river\r\nside of the town. Sober, he was good-natured and obliging; drunken, he\r\nwas sullen, with a disposition to skulk out of sight and be alone. His\r\ndaughter Dennie had her father\u0027s good-nature combined with a will power\r\nall her own.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Fenneben watched her about her work this morning, he noted\r\nhow comfortably she took hold of it. He noted, too, that her heavy\r\nyellow-brown hair was full of ripples just where ripples helped, that\r\nher arms were plump, that she was short and nothing willowy, and that\r\nshe had a mischievous twinkle in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why don\u0027t you take a holiday, Miss Dennie?” he asked, presently.\r\n\r\n“I wanted this done so I wouldn\u0027t be seeing dusty books in my\r\ndaydreams,” Dennie answered.\r\n\r\n“Where do you do your dreaming today?”\r\n\r\n“A crowd of us are going down the river to the Kickapoo Corral. I must\r\nmake the cakes yet this morning,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Good enough Can\u0027t I do something for you? Do you need a chaperon?” the\r\nDean queried, smilingly.\r\n\r\n“Professor Burgess is to be our chaperon. He is all we can look after.”\r\n Dennie\u0027s gray eyes danced, but she was serious a moment later.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Fenneben, you can do something, maybe, that\u0027s none of your\r\nbusiness, nor mine.” Dennie wondered afterward how she could have had\r\nthe courage to speak these words.\r\n\r\n“That\u0027s generally the easy thing. What is it?” the Dean smiled.\r\n\r\nThe girl hung her feather brush in its place and sat down opposite to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Do you know anything about Pigeon Place?” she began.\r\n\r\n“The little place up the river where a queer, half-crazy woman lives\r\nalone with a fierce dog?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you never heard anything more?” Dennie queried.\r\n\r\n“Only that the house is hidden from the road and has many pigeons about\r\nit, and that the woman sees few callers. I\u0027ve never located the place.\r\nTell me about it,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Bug Buler and I were up there after eggs this morning. Bug is Victor\r\nBurleigh\u0027s little boy. They board at our house,” Dennie explained.\r\n“Pigeon Place is a little cottage all covered with vines and with\r\nflowers everywhere. It\u0027s hidden away from the road just outside of town.\r\nMrs. Marian isn\u0027t crazy nor queer, only she seldom leaves home, never\r\ngoes to church, nor visits anywhere. She doesn\u0027t care for anybody, nor\r\ntake any interest in Lagonda Ledge, and she keeps a Great Dane dog, as\r\nbig as a calf, that is friendly to women and children, but won\u0027t let a\r\nman come near, unless Mrs. Marian says so.” Dennie paused.\r\n\r\n“Very interesting, Miss Dennie, but what can I do?” Fenneben asked.\r\n“Shall I kill the dog and carry off the woman like the regulation grim\r\nogre of the fairy tales?”\r\n\r\nDennie hesitated. Few girls would have come to a college president on\r\nsuch a mission as hers. But then few college presidents are like Lloyd\r\nFenneben.\r\n\r\n“Of course nobody likes Mrs. Marian, and my father--when he\u0027s not quite\r\nhimself--says dreadful things if I mention her name.” Dennie\u0027s checks\r\nwere crimson as she thought of her father. “It\u0027s none of my business,\r\nbut I\u0027ve felt sorry for Mrs. Marian ever since she came here. She seems\r\nlike an innocent outcast.”\r\n\r\n“That is very pitiful.” Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s voice was sympathetic.\r\n\r\n“This morning,” continued Dennie, “Bug was playing with the dog outside,\r\nand I went into the house for the first time. Mrs. Marian is very\r\npleasant. She asked me about my work here and I told her about Sunrise\r\nand you, and your niece, Miss Elinor, being here.”\r\n\r\n“All the interesting features. Did you mention Professor Burgess?” The\r\nquery was innocently meant, but it brought the color to Dennie Saxon\u0027s\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n“No, I didn\u0027t think he was in that class,” she replied, quickly. “But\r\nwhat surprised me was her interest in things. She is a pretty, refined,\r\nyoung-looking woman, with gray hair. When I was leaving I turned back\r\nto ask about some eggs for Saturday. She thought I was gone, and she had\r\ndropped her head on the table and was crying, so I slipped out without\r\nher knowing.” Dennie\u0027s gray eyes were full of tears now. “Dr. Fenneben,\r\nif talking about Sunrise made her do that, maybe you might do something\r\nfor her. I pity her so. Nobody seems to care about her. My father is\r\nset against her when he is not responsible, and he might--” She stopped\r\nabruptly and did not finish the sentence.\r\n\r\nThe Dean looked out of the window at the purple mist melting along the\r\nhorizon line. Down in the valley pigeons were circling above a wooded\r\nspot at a bend in the Walnut River. Fenneben remembered now that he had\r\nseen them there many times. He had a boyhood memory of a country home\r\nwith pigeons flying about it.\r\n\r\n“I wish, too, that I might do something,” he said at last. “You say she\r\nwill not let men inside her gate now. I\u0027ll keep her in mind, though. The\r\ngate may open some time.”\r\n\r\nIt was mid-afternoon when Lloyd Fenneben left his study for a stroll. As\r\nhe approached the Saxon House, he saw old Bond Saxon slipping out of the\r\nside gate and with uncertain steps skulk down the alley.\r\n\r\n“Poor old sinner! What a slave and a fool whisky can make of a man!” he\r\nthought. Then he remembered Dennie\u0027s anxiety of the morning. “There must\r\nbe some cause for his prejudice against this strange hermit woman when\r\nhe is drunk. Bond Saxon is not a man to hate anybody when he is sober.”\r\n\r\n“Is you Don Fonnybone?” Bug Buler\u0027s little piping voice from the\r\ndoorstep haled the Dean. “I finked Vic would turn, and he don\u0027t turn,\r\nand I \u0027s hungry for somebody. May I go wis you, Don Fonnybone?” The baby\r\nlips quivered.\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben held out his hand and Bug put his little fist into it.\r\n\r\n“Where shall we go, Bug? I \u0027m hungry for somebody, too.”\r\n\r\n“Let\u0027s do find the bunny the bid dod ist scared away this morning. Turn\r\non!”\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben was hardly conscious that Bug was choosing their path\r\nas the two strolled away together. Everywhere there was the pathos of a\r\nwaning autumn day, and a soft haze creeping out of the west was making a\r\nblood-red carbuncle of the sun, set as a jewel on the amber-veiled bosom\r\nof the sky. The air was soft, wooing the spirit to a still, sweet peace.\r\nThe two were at the outskirts of Lagonda Ledge now. The last board walk\r\nwas three blocks back, and the cinder-made way had dwindled to a bare\r\nhard path by the roadside. A bend in the river cutting close to the road\r\nshows a long vista of the Walnut bordered by vine-draped shrubbery and\r\noverhung with trees. A slab of limestone beside a huge elm tree had\r\nbeen placed at this bend to prevent the bank from breaking, or a chance\r\nmisdriving into the water.\r\n\r\n“I \u0027s pitty tired,” Bug said as the two reached the stone. “Will we tum\r\nto the bunny\u0027s house pitty soon?”\r\n\r\n“We\u0027ll rest here a while and maybe the bunny will come out to meet us,”\r\n Dr. Fenneben said, and they sat down on the broad stone.\r\n\r\n“It was somewhere here the bunny runned.” Little Bug studied the\r\nroadside with a quaint puzzled face. “Is you \u0027faid of snakes?”\r\n\r\n“Not very much.” The Dean\u0027s eyes were on the graceful flight of pigeons\r\ncircling about the trees beyond the bend.\r\n\r\n“Vic isn\u0027t \u0027faid. He killed bid one, two, five, free wattle, wattle\r\nsnakes--” Bug caught his breath suddenly--“He told me not to tell that.\r\nI fordot. I don\u0027t \u0027member. He didn\u0027t do it--he didn\u0027t killed no snakes\r\nfornever.”\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben gave little heed to this prattle. His eyes were on the\r\npigeons cleaving the air with short, graceful flights. Presently he felt\r\nthe soft touch of baby curls against his hand, and little Bug had fallen\r\nasleep with his drooping head on Fenneben\u0027s lap.\r\n\r\nThe Dean gently placed the tired little one in an easy position, and\r\nrested his shoulder against the tree.\r\n\r\n“That must be Pigeon Place,” he mused. “Every town has its odd\r\ncharacters. This is one of Lagonda Ledge\u0027s little mysteries. Dennie\r\nfinds it a pathetic one. How graceful those pigeons are!” And his\r\nthoughts drifted to a far New England homestead where pigeons used to\r\nsweep about an old barn roof.\r\n\r\nA fuzzy gray rabbit flashed across the road, followed by a Great Dane\r\ndog in hot chase.\r\n\r\n“Bug\u0027s bunny! I hope the big murderer will miss it,” Fenneben thought.\r\n\r\nThe roadside bushes half hid him. As the crashing sound of the huge dog\r\nthrough the underbrush ceased he noticed a woman coming leisurely toward\r\nhim. Her arms were full of bitter-sweet berries and flaming autumn\r\nleaves. She wore no hat and Fenneben saw that her gray hair was wound\r\nlike a coronal about her head. Before he could catch sight of her face a\r\nheavy staggering step was beside him, and old Bond Saxon, muttering and\r\nshaking his clenched fists, passed beyond him toward the woman. Lloyd\r\nFenneben\u0027s own fists clenched, but he sat stone still. The woman seemed\r\nto melt into the bushes and obliterate herself entirely, while the\r\ndrunken man stalked unsteadily on toward where she had been. Then\r\nshaking his fists vehemently at the pigeons, he skulked around the bend\r\nin the road.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was out of sight the woman emerged from the bushes, with\r\nautumn leaves hiding her crown of hair. She hastened a few rods toward\r\nthe man watching her, then disappeared through a vine-covered gateway\r\ninto a wilderness of shrubbery, beyond which the pigeons were cooing\r\nabout their cotes.\r\n\r\nAs she closed the gate, she caught sight of Lloyd Fenneben, leaning\r\nmotionless against the gray bole of the elm tree. But she was looking\r\nthrough a tangle of purple oak leaves and twining bitter-sweet branches,\r\nand Fenneben was unconscious of being discovered.\r\n\r\n“A woman never could whistle,” he smiled, as he listened, “but that call\r\nseems to do for the dog, all right.”\r\n\r\nThe Great Dane was tearing across lots in answer to the trill of a\r\nwoman\u0027s voice.\r\n\r\n“She is safe now. But what does it all mean? Is there a wayside tragedy\r\nhere that calls for my unraveling?”\r\n\r\nAttracted by some subtle force beyond his power to check, he turned\r\ntoward the river and looked steadily at the still overhanging shrubbery.\r\nJust below him, where the current turns, the quiet waters were lapping\r\nabout a ledge of rock. Between that ledge and himself a tangle of bushes\r\nclutched the steep bank. He looked straight into the tangle, just plain\r\ntwig and brown leaf, giving place as he stared, for two still black\r\nhuman eyes looking balefully at him as a snake at its prey. Lloyd\r\nFenneben could not withdraw his gaze. The two eyes--no other human token\r\nvisible--just two cruel human eyes full of human hate were fixed on him.\r\nAnd the fascination of the thing was paralyzing, horrible. He could not\r\nmove nor utter a sound. Bug Buler woke with a little cry. The bushes by\r\nthe riverside just rippled--one quiver of motion--and the eyes were not\r\nthere. Then Fenneben knew that his heart, which had been still for an\r\nage, had begun to beat again. Bug stared up into his face, dazed from\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n“Where\u0027s my Vic? Who\u0027s dot me?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“We came to hunt the bunny. He\u0027s gone away again. Shall we go back\r\nhome?” The gentle voice and strong hand soothed the little one.\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s dettin\u0027 told. Let\u0027s wun home.” Bug cuddled against Fenneben\u0027s side\r\nand hugged his hand. “I love you lots,” he said, looking up with eyes of\r\ninnocent trust.\r\n\r\n“Yes, let\u0027s run home. There is a storm in the air and the sun is hidden\r\nfrom the valley.” He stooped and kissed the little upturned face. “Thank\r\nheaven for children!” he murmured. “Amid skulking, drunken men and\r\nstrange, lonely women, and cruel eyes of unknown beings, they lead us\r\nloving-wise back home again.”\r\n\r\nBehind the vine-covered gate a gray-haired, fair-faced woman watched the\r\ntwo as they disappeared down the road.\r\n\r\nAnd the blood-red sun out on the west prairie sank swiftly into a blue\r\ncloudbank, presaging the coming of a storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE KICKAPOO CORRAL\r\n\r\n _And even now, as the night comes, and the shadows\r\n     gather round,\r\n And you tell the old-time story, I can almost hear\r\n     the sound\r\n Of the horses\u0027 hoofs in the silence, and the voices of\r\n     struggling men;\r\n For the night is the same forever, and the time\r\n     comes back again_.\r\n                         --JAMES W. STEELE\r\n\r\nFROM the beginning of things in the Walnut Valley, the Kickapoo Corral\r\nhad its uses. Nature built it to this end. The river course follows the\r\npattern of the letter S faced westward instead of eastward. The upper\r\nhalf of the letter is properly shaped, but the sharpened curve at the\r\nmiddle leaves only a narrow distance across the lower space. In this\r\noutline runs the Walnut, its upper curve almost surrounding a little\r\nwooded peninsula that slopes gently on its side to the water\u0027s edge. But\r\nthe farther bank stands up in a straight limestone bluff forming a high\r\nwall of protection about the river-encircled ground. A less severe bluff\r\ncrosses the open part of the peninsula, reaching the hither side of\r\nthe river below the sharp bend. The space inside, stone-walled and\r\nwater-bound, made an ideal shelter for the wild life that should inhabit\r\nit. And Nature saw that it was good and went away and left it, not\r\nforgetting to lock the door upon it. For the enemy who would enter this\r\nprotecting shelter must come through the gateway of the river. There\r\nwas only one right place to do this. Deceivingly near to the shallow\r\nrock-based ford before the Corral, so near that only the wise ones knew\r\nhow to miss it, Nature placed the cruelest whirlpool that ever swung an\r\neven surface up stream, its gentle motion telling nothing of the\r\nfatal suction underneath that level stretch of steady, slow moving,\r\nirresistible water.\r\n\r\nWhat use the primitive tribes made of this spot the river has\r\nnever told. But in the day of the Kickapoo supremacy it came to its\r\nchristening. Here the tribe found a refuge and harbored its stolen\r\nplunder. From this wooded covert it sent its death-singing arrows\r\nthrough the heart of its enemy who dared to stand in relief on that\r\nstone bluff. Here it laughed at the drowning cries of those who were\r\ncaught in the fatal whirlpool beyond the curve in the river wall, and\r\nhere it endured siege and slaughter when foes were valiant enough, and\r\nnumerous enough to storm into its stronghold over the dead bodies of\r\ntheir own vanguard.\r\n\r\nWeird and tragical are the legends of the Kickapoo Corral, left for a\r\nstronger race to marvel over. For, with the swing of time, the white man\r\ncut a road down the steep bluff at the sharpest bend and made a ford\r\nin the shallow place between the whirlpool and the old Corral, and the\r\nNature-built stockade became a peaceful spot, specially ordained by\r\nProvidence, the Sunrise Freshmen claimed, as a picnic ground for their\r\nautumn holiday. At least the young folk for whom Professor Burgess was\r\nacting as chaperon took it so, and reveled in the right.\r\n\r\nInterest in Greek had greatly increased in Sunrise with the advent of\r\nthe handsome young Harvard man, and his desired seclusion for profound\r\nresearch had not yet been fully realized. Types for study were\r\nplentiful, however, especially the type of the presumptuous young fellow\r\nwho dared to admire Elinor Wream. By divine right she was the most\r\npopular girl in Sunrise, which pleased Professor Burgess up to a certain\r\npoint. That point was Victor Burleigh. The silent antagonism between\r\nthese two daily grew stronger; why, neither one could have told up to\r\nthis holiday.\r\n\r\nThe day had been perfect--the weather, the dinner, the company, the\r\nwoodland--even the amber light in the sky softening the glow as the\r\nafternoon slipped down toward twilight in the sheltered old Corral.\r\n\r\n“Come, Vic Burleigh, help me to start this fire for supper,” Dennie\r\nSaxon called. “We won\u0027t get our coffee and ham and eggs ready before\r\nmidnight.”\r\n\r\n“Here, Trench, or some of you fellows, get busy,” Vic called back to the\r\nbig right guard of the Sunrise football squad. “Elinor and I are going\r\nto climb the west bluff to see what\u0027s the matter with the sun. It looks\r\nsick. I\u0027ve been hired man all day; carried nineteen girls across the\r\nshallows, packed all the lunch-baskets, toted all the wood, built all\r\nthe fires, washed all the dishes--”\r\n\r\n“Ate all the dinner, drank all the grape juice, stepped on all the\r\ncustard pies, upset all the cream bottles. Oh, you piker, get out!”\r\n Trench aimed an empty lunch-basket at Vic\u0027s head with the words.\r\n\r\nBeing a chaperon was a pleasant office to Professor Burgess today but\r\nfor the task of throwing a barrier about Elinor every time Vic Burleigh\r\ncame near. And Burleigh, lacking many other things more than insight,\r\nkept him busy at barrier building.\r\n\r\n“Miss Wream, you can\u0027t think of climbing that rough place,” Burgess\r\nprotested, with a sharp glance of resentment at the big young fellow who\r\ndared to call her Elinor.\r\n\r\nThe tiger-light blazed in the eyes that flashed back at him, as Vic\r\ncried daringly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, come on, Elinor; be a good Indian!”\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t do it, Miss Wream,” Vincent Burgess pleaded.\r\n\r\nElinor looked from the one to the other, and the very magnetism of power\r\ncalled her.\r\n\r\n“I mean to try, anyhow,” she declared. “Will you pick me up if I fall,\r\nVictor?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn\u0027t hardly go away and leave you to perish miserably,” Vic\r\nassured her, and they were off together.\r\n\r\nThe Wream men were slender, and all of them, except Lloyd Fenneben, the\r\nstepbrother, wore nose glasses and drank hot water at breakfast, and ate\r\npredigested foods, and talked of acids and carbons, and took prescribed\r\ngestures for exercise. The joyousness of perfect health was in every\r\nmotion of this young man. His brown sweater showed a hard white throat.\r\nHe planted his feet firmly. And he leaped up the bluffside easily. If\r\nElinor slipped, the strength of his grip on her arm reassured her, until\r\nclimbing beside him became a joy.\r\n\r\nThe bluff was less surly than it appeared to be down in the Corral, and\r\nthe benediction of autumn was in the view from its crest. They sat\r\ndown on the stone ledge crowning it, and Elinor threw aside her jaunty\r\nscarlet outing cap. The breezes played in her dark hair, and her cheeks\r\nwere pink from the exercise. Victor Burleigh looked at her with frank,\r\nwide-open eyes.\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s the matter? Is my hair a fright?” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“A fright!” Burleigh flung off his cap and ran his fingers through his\r\nown hair. “Not what I call a fright,” he asserted in an even tone.\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s that scar on your left arm? It looks like a little hole dug\r\nout,” Elinor declared.\r\n\r\nVic\u0027s brown sweater sleeve was pushed up to the elbow.\r\n\r\n“It is a little hole I put in where I dug out the flesh with a pocket\r\nknife,” he replied, carelessly.\r\n\r\n“Did you do that yourself?” Elinor cried. “What made you be so cruel?”\r\n\r\n“I wasn\u0027t so cruel. \u0027I seen my duty and I done it noble,\u0027 as the essay\r\nruns. I made that vacancy to get ahead of a rattlesnake that got me\r\nthere, a venomous big one with nine police calls on its tail, and that\u0027s\r\nno snake story, either. I cut the flesh out to get rid of the poison.\r\nI was n\u0027t in a college laboratory and I had to work fast and use what\r\ntools I had with me. I killed the gentleman that did the mischief,\r\nthough,” Vic added carelessly, deftly slipping down his sleeve as if to\r\nchange the subject.\r\n\r\n“Oh, tell me about it, do,” Elinor urged. “You were killing a snake the\r\nfirst time I saw you.”\r\n\r\nHow dainty and sweet she was sitting there in her neat-fitting outing\r\nsuit of dark gray with scarlet pipings and buttons and pocket flaps,\r\nand the scarlet of her full lips, and the coral tint of her cheeks, the\r\nwhite hands and white throat and brow, the dark eyes and finely shaped\r\nhead with abundant beautiful hair.\r\n\r\nVic Burleigh sat looking straight at her and the light in his own eyes\r\ntold nothing of the glitter that had flashed in them when he glared at\r\nProfessor Burgess down in the Corral.\r\n\r\n“I wasn\u0027t killing snakes. I was looking up at a girl on the rotunda\r\nstairs the first time,” he said, “and I don\u0027t want to tell about this\r\nscar, because I\u0027ve wished a thousand times to forget it. See how much\r\ndarker it is down there than it is up here.”\r\n\r\nThe shadows were lengthening in the Corral where the supper fires were\r\ngleaming. Across the low bluff the imprisoned sun was sending a dull red\r\nglow along the waters of the Walnut.\r\n\r\n“Look at that still place in the river, Victor. The ripples are all on\r\nthe farther side,” Elinor said, looking pensively downstream.\r\n\r\n“Watch it a minute. Do you see that bit of drift coming upstream in the\r\nstill water?” Vic asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, the water does move; toward us, too, instead of down the river.\r\nI\u0027d like to boat around in that quiet place.”\r\n\r\nShe was leaning forward, resting her chin in her hand. In outline\r\nagainst the misty background shot through with the crimson light from\r\nthe storm-smothered sun, with the gray shadows of the old Kickapoo\r\nCorral below them, hemmed in by the silver gleaming waters of the\r\nWalnut, a picture grew up before Victor Burleigh\u0027s eyes that he was\r\nnever to forget. Like the cleft of the lightning through the cloud, like\r\nthe flash of the swallow\u0027s wing, the careless-hearted boy leaped to\r\nthe stature of a man, into whose soul the love of a lifetime is born.\r\nUnconsciously, he drew away from her, and long afterward she recalled\r\nthe sweetness of his deep voice when he spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Elinor Wream, I\u0027d rather see you helpless up here with the hungriest\r\nwild beast between us that ever tore a human form to pieces than to see\r\nyou in that quiet water below the shallows.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Elinor looked up into his face.\r\n\r\n“Because I could save your life here, maybe, even if I lost mine. Down\r\nthere I could drown for you, but that would n\u0027t save you. Nobody\r\never swam that whirlpool and lived to tell about it. There\u0027s a ledge\r\nunderneath that holds down what the infernal slow suction swallows. But\r\nit\u0027s dead sure.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that\u0027s awful,” Elinor said, lightly, for she had no picture of him\r\nengulfed in the slow-moving treachery below them.\r\n\r\n“There\u0027s an old Indian legend about that pool,” Vic said, staring down\r\nat the water.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about it.” Elinor was breaking the twigs from a branch of\r\nbuck-berry growing beside her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it\u0027s a tragical one, like everything else about that place,” Vic\r\nresponded, grimly. “Old Lagonda, Chief of the Wahoos, I reckon, I don\u0027t\r\nknow his tribe, did n\u0027t want to give up this valley to the sons and\r\nheirs of Sunrise to desecrate with salmon cans and pop bottles and\r\nHarvard-turned chaperons. He held out against putting his multiplication\r\nsign to the treaty, claiming that land was like water and air and could\r\nn\u0027t be bought and sold. But the white men with true missionary courtesy\r\nheld his head under water till he burbled \u0027Nuff,\u0027 and signed up with\r\na piece of charcoal. Then he went down the river to this smooth-faced\r\nwhirlpool, and laid a curse on the sons of men who had taken his own\r\nfrom him.”\r\n\r\nThe twilight had deepened. The sun was lost in the cloudbank out of\r\nwhich a hot wind was sweeping eastward. Vic was telling the story well,\r\nand the magnetism of his voice was compelling. Elinor drew nearer to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“What was the curse? I would n\u0027t want to go near that place, unless you\r\nwere with me.”\r\n\r\nThe very innocence of the words put a thrill in Vic Burleigh\u0027s every\r\npulse beat.\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t ever do it, if you can help it.” Vic could not keep back the\r\nwords. “Old Lagonda decreed a tribute to the river for the wrong done to\r\nhim, a life a year in that pool. And the Walnut has been exacting in its\r\nrights. Life after life has gone out down there until sometimes it seems\r\nlike the old chief\u0027s curse would never be lifted.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it may be, while I am at Sunrise, anyhow,” Elinor said. “I don\u0027t\r\nlike real tragedies about me. I like an easy, comfortable life, and\r\neverybody good and happy. I hope the curse will be staid until I go back\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nVic hadn\u0027t thought of this. Of course, she would leave Sunrise\r\nsome time. Her home was in Cambridge-by-the-Sea, not on the\r\nPrairie-by-the-Walnut. She belonged to the dead-language scholars, not\r\nto crude red-blooded creatures like himself. He turned his face to the\r\nwest and the threatening sky seemed in harmony with his storm-riven\r\nsoul. He was so young--less than half an hour older than the big\r\nwhole-hearted fellow who started up the bluff in picnic frolic with a\r\npretty girl whom Professor Burgess adored. That was one reason why he\r\nhad brought her up. He wanted to tease the Professor then. He hated\r\nBurgess now, and the white teeth clinched at the thought of him.\r\n\r\nA sudden shouting and beating of tom-toms down in the Corral, and the\r\ncall in crude rhyme to straggling couples to close in, announced supper.\r\nHigh above other whooping the voice of Trench, the big right guard,\r\nreached the top of the bluff:\r\n\r\n Victor Burleigh and Elinor Wream,\r\n Better wake from Love\u0027s Young Dream,\r\n Before the ants get into the cream.\r\n\r\nThe beating of a dishpan drowned the chorus. Then down by the river\r\nDennie\u0027s soprano streamed out,\r\n\r\n The sun is sot,\r\n The coffee\u0027s hot,\r\n The supper\u0027s got.\r\n          What?\r\n     Yes! Got!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswering this call from the north end of the Corral, a heavy base\r\ngrowled,\r\n\r\n Dennie is sad,\r\n The eggs are bad;\r\n The Professor\u0027s mad\r\n At a College lad.\r\n Burleigh! Burly! Burlee!\r\n Come home! Come home! Come home!\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Kickapoos are on the warpath. Let\u0027s go down and get into the\r\nrunning.”\r\n\r\nVic lifted Elinor to her feet with a sort of reverence in his touch. But\r\nshe did not note that it was otherwise than the good-natured grip of the\r\ncomrade who had helped her up the steep places half an hour ago.\r\n\r\nDescent was more difficult, and it was growing dark rapidly. Vic held\r\nher arm to keep her from falling, and once on a sliding rock, he had to\r\ncatch both of her hands, and half-lift her to solid footing. Her shining\r\neyes, starbright in the gloom, the dainty rose hue of her cheeks, the\r\ntouch of her soft white hands, and her need for his strength, made the\r\nshadowy path delicious for her companion.\r\n\r\nThe call of the wild was in that evening camp in the autumn woodland,\r\nin the charm of the deepening twilight warmed with the red glow of the\r\nfires, in the appetizing odor of coffee, the unconventional freedom,\r\nthe carelessness of youth, the jolly good-fellowship of comrades. To\r\nProfessor Burgess it had the added charm of newness. All the pleasures\r\nof popularity were his this evening, for he was young himself, he\r\ndressed well, and he had the grace of a gentleman. The enjoyment of the\r\nday gave him a thrill of surprise. He was already dropping the viewpoint\r\nof Dr. Joshua Wream for Dean Fenneben\u0027s angle of vision. And in these\r\npicturesque surroundings he forgot about the weather and the prudence of\r\ngetting home early.\r\n\r\n“Throw that log on the fire, Vic. It begins to look spooky back\r\nhere. I\u0027ve just had my ear to the ground and I heard an awful roaring\r\nsomewhere.” Trench, who had been sprawling lazily in the shadows, now\r\ndeclared, “Say, I\u0027d hate to be penned into this place so I couldn\u0027t get\r\nout. There\u0027s no skinning up that rock wall even if a fellow could swim\r\nthe river, and I can\u0027t,” and the big guard stretched himself on the\r\nground again.\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s that old story about the Kickapoos here?” somebody asked.\r\n“Dennie Saxon knows it. Tell us about it, Dennie, AND THEN WE\u0027LL ALL GO\r\nHOME.” The last words were half-sung.\r\n\r\n“Be swift, Dennie, be quite swift. I heard that noise again. I\u0027m afraid\r\nit\u0027s a stampede of wild horses.” Trench, who had had his ear to the\r\nground, sat up suddenly. But nobody paid any attention to him.\r\n\r\n“Come, Denmark Saxon, let\u0027s close the day in song and story. You tell\r\nthe story and then I\u0027ll sing the song,” somebody declared.\r\n\r\n“Aw-w-w!” a prolonged chorus. “Make your story long, Dennie; make it\r\nlengthy.”\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t you do it, Dennie. I tell you this ground is shaking. I feel it,”\r\n Trench insisted.\r\n\r\n“Say, who\u0027s got the bromo-seltzer? The right guard\u0027s supper is n\u0027t\r\ntreating him right. Go ahead, Dennie,” the crowd urged.\r\n\r\nThey were all in a circle about the fire. Its flickering glow lighted\r\nVic Burleigh\u0027s rugged face, and gleamed in his auburn hair. Elinor sat\r\nbetween him and Vincent Burgess. Dennie was just beyond Vincent, who\r\nnoted incidentally the play of light and shadow on the blowsy ripples of\r\nher hair that night and remembered it all on a day long afterward.\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time,” Dennie began,\r\n\r\nthere was a beautiful Kickapoo Indian maiden--”\r\n\r\n“Yep, any Kickapoo\u0027s a beaut. Hurry up, Dennie. I hear something\r\ncoming.” It was the big lazy guard again.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Vic Burleigh, sit on his prostrate form. Go on, Dennie,” the\r\ncompany insisted, and she continued.\r\n\r\n“Her name was The Fawn of the Morning Light, her best lover was Swift\r\nElk.”\r\n\r\n“You be Mrs. Swift Elk--” but Vic Burleigh\u0027s arm about Trench\u0027s throat\r\nchoked his words.\r\n\r\n“And there was a wily Sioux, named Red Fox, who loved the Fawn and\r\nwanted her to marry him. She wouldn\u0027t do it. The Kickapoos were heap-big\r\ngrafters, and they had this old Corral full of ponies and junk they had\r\nrelieved other tribes of caring for. And the only way to get in here,\r\nbesides falling over the bluff and becoming a pin-cushion for poisoned\r\narrows, was to come in by the shallows in the river where the ford is\r\nnow above old Lagonda\u0027s pool, and most Indians needed a diagram for\r\nthat.” Although Dennie spoke lightly, she shuddered a little at the\r\nthought, and the whole company grew graver.\r\n\r\n“An Indian doesn\u0027t forget. So, Red Fox, who had sworn to have The\r\nFawn, came down here with hundreds of Sioux who wanted the ponies the\r\nKickapoos had stolen, as Red Fox wanted Swift Elk\u0027s girl. The Kickapoos\r\nwouldn\u0027t give up the ponies and Swift Elk wouldn\u0027t give up The Fawn. So\r\nthe siege began. Right where we are so safe and peaceful tonight those\r\nKickapoos fought, and starved, and died, while the Sioux kept cruel\r\nwatch on the top of that old stone ledge, never letting one escape. At\r\nlast, after hours and hours of siege, The Fawn and Swift Elk decided to\r\nescape by the river in the night. A storm had come on suddenly, and\r\na cloudburst up the Walnut was sending a perfect surge of water down\r\naround the bend. The two lovers were caught in its sweep and carried\r\nbeyond the shallows when a flash of lightning showed them to Red Fox\r\nwatching on the bluff up there. At the next flash he sent an arrow\r\nstraight through Swift Elk\u0027s body and into The Fawn\u0027s shoulder, pinning\r\nthe two together. The Sioux leaped into the stream to save the girl he\r\nloved, but the heavy current swept them toward the whirlpool, and before\r\nthey could prevent the dying and wounded and rescuing were all caught\r\nby the fatal suction. Then the Sioux warriors rushed in from all sides,\r\nupstream, down the bluff from west prairie, and over the Corral, and\r\nslaughtered every Kickapoo here. Their fierce yells and the shrieks of\r\nthe squaws and pappooses, the pounding of horses\u0027 hoofs in the stampede\r\nof hundreds of ponies, the roar of the river, the wrath of the storm\r\nmade a scene this old Corral will never see again.” Dennie paused.\r\n\r\n“I think I hear something like it, right now,” came Trench\u0027s\r\nirrepressible voice from the shadows in the edge of the circle. But\r\nnobody heeded it.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while from far across the west prairie the stormcloud was\r\nrolling in, black and angry, blowing its hot breath before it, while\r\nfrom a cloudburst upstream an hour before a great surge of water was\r\nrushing down the Walnut, turning the quiet river to a murderous flood.\r\nBut the high walls hid all this from the valley and the heedless young\r\nfolk took the full time limit of their holiday in the sheltering gloom\r\nof the old Kickapoo Corral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE STORM\r\n\r\n _Rock and moan, and roar alone,\r\n And the dread of some nameless thing unknown_.\r\n                         --LOWELL\r\n\r\nTHE silence following Dennie\u0027s story was broken by a sudden peal of\r\nthunder overhead. At the same instant the blackness of midnight\r\nlifted itself above the stone ledges and dropped down upon the Corral,\r\nsmothering everything in darkness. A rushing whirlwind, a lurid blaze\r\nof lightning, and a second peal of thunder threw the camp into blind\r\ndisorder. In the minute\u0027s lull following the first storm herald, there\r\nwas a wild scrambling for wraps and lunch baskets. Then the darkness\r\nthickened and the storm\u0027s fury burst upon the crowd--a mad lashing\r\nof bending tree tops, a blinding whirl of dust filling the air, the\r\nthunder\u0027s terrific cannonade, the incessant blaze of lightning, the\r\nrattling of the distant rain; and above all these, unlike them all, a\r\nsteady, dreadful roaring, coming nearer each moment.\r\n\r\nProfessor Burgess was no coward, but he had little power of generalship.\r\nAs the crowd huddled together under the swaying trees, Trench called to\r\nBurleigh:\r\n\r\n“There\u0027s been a cloudburst up stream. The roar I\u0027ve been hearing is a\r\nwall of water coming down. We\u0027ve got to get out of this.”\r\n\r\nThen above all the crashing and booming they heard Vic Burleigh\u0027s voice:\r\n\r\n“Every fellow take a girl and run for the ford. Come on!”\r\n\r\nIn the darkness, each boy caught the arm of the girl nearest him and\r\nmade a dash for the ford. A flash of lightning showed Burleigh that the\r\nwhite-faced girl clinging to his arm was Elinor Wream. After that, the\r\nstorm was a plaything for him.\r\n\r\nThe first to reach the ford were Vincent Burgess and Dennie Saxon.\r\nDennie was sure-footed and she knew by instinct where to find the\r\nshallows. But the river was rising rapidly and the waters were black and\r\nangry under the lightning\u0027s glitter. As the crowd held back Vic shouted:\r\n\r\n“You\u0027ll have to wade. It\u0027s not very deep yet. Professor, you must cross\r\nfirst, and count \u0027em as they come. Go quick! One at a time. The way\r\nis narrow. And for God\u0027s sake, keep to the upper side of the shallows.\r\nStand in the middle, Trench, and don\u0027t let them get down stream below\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThey were all safely across except Vic and Elinor, when Trench cried\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“Send your girl in quick, Burleigh, and you run west. The flood is at\r\nthe bend now. Hurry!”\r\n\r\n“Run in, Elinor. Trench will take you through, and I\u0027ll follow, for I\r\ncan swim and he can\u0027t. I\u0027ll be right behind you. Run!”\r\n\r\nA vision of the whirlpool and of Swift Elk and The Fawn flashed into\r\nElinor\u0027s mind, filling her with terror. Before Vic could push her\r\nforward, Trench shouted:\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s too late. Don\u0027t try it. I\u0027ve got to run.”\r\n\r\nHe was strong and sure-footed and he fought his way gallantly to the\r\nfurther side as a great wave swirled around the curve of the river,\r\nengulfing the shallows in its mad surge. When he reached the east bank\r\nthe count of the company numbered all but two.\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s Vic and Elinor,” Trench declared. “Vic wouldn\u0027t come till the\r\nlast, and Elinor was too dead scared to trust anybody else, I guess.\r\nNobody could cross there now, Professor. But Vic is as strong as an\r\nox and he\u0027s not afraid of the devil. He\u0027ll keep both their heads above\r\nwater. He wants to win out in the Thanksgiving game too much to get lost\r\nnow. Trust him to get up the bluff some way, and back to town by the\r\nMain street bridge like as not, before we get there. There\u0027s no shelter\r\nbetween here and Lagonda Ledge. Let\u0027s all cut for it before the rain\r\nbeats us into the mud.”\r\n\r\nThe deluge was just beginning, so, safe, but wet, and mud-smeared,\r\nfighting wind and rain and darkness, taking it all as a jolly lark,\r\nalthough they had slidden into safety but a hand\u0027s breadth in front of\r\ndeath, the couples straggled back to town.\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess, anxious, angry, and jealous, found an unconscious\r\ncomfort in Dennie Saxon in that homeward struggle. She was so capable\r\nand cheery that he forgot a little the girl who had as surely drawn him\r\nKansas-ward as his interest in types and geographical breadth had done.\r\nIt dimly entered his consciousness, as he told Dennie good-bye, that\r\nmaybe she had been the most desirable companion of the crowd on such a\r\nnight as this. He knew, at least, that he would have shown Elinor much\r\nmore attention than he had shown to Dennie, and he knew that Elinor\r\nwould have required it of him.\r\n\r\nThe light from the hall was streaming across the veranda of the Saxon\r\nHouse, a beam as faithful and friendly at the border of the lower campus\r\nas the bigger beacon in the college turret up on the lime-stone ridge.\r\nAs Burgess started away the worst deluge of the night fell out of the\r\nsky, so he dropped down on a seat to wait for the downpour to weaken.\r\nHe was very tired and his mind was feverishly busy. Where could Burleigh\r\nand Elinor be now? What dangers might threaten them? What ill might\r\nbefall Elinor from exposure to this beating storm? He was frantic with\r\nthe thought. Then he recalled Dennie, the girl who was working her\r\nway through college, whom he--Professor Vincent Burgess, A.B., from\r\nHarvard--had escorted home. How cheap Kansas was making him. The boys\r\nand girls had taken Dennie as one of them today; and truly, she did add\r\nto the comfort and pleasure of the outing. It seemed all right down in\r\nthe woods where all was unconventional. But now, alone, in how common a\r\ngrade he seemed to have placed himself, to be forced to pay attention to\r\nthe poorest girl in school. His cheeks grew hot at the very thought of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the shadows, beyond him, a form straightened up stupidly:\r\n\r\n“Shay, Profesh Burgush, that you?”\r\n\r\nDennie\u0027s father, half-drunken still! Oh, Shades of classic culture! To\r\nwhat depths in social contact may a college man fall in this wretched\r\nland!\r\n\r\n“Shay! Is\u0027t you, or ain\u0027t it you? You gonna tell me?” Old Bond queried.\r\n\r\n“This is Vincent Burgess,” the young man replied.\r\n\r\n“Dennie home?” the father asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” came the curt answer.\r\n\r\n“Who? Who bring her home? Vic Burleigh?”\r\n\r\n“I brought her home. She is a good girl, too.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself, Burgess resented the shame of such a father for the\r\ncapable, happy-spirited daughter.\r\n\r\n“Yesh, Dennie\u0027s good girl, all right.”\r\n\r\nThen a silence fell.\r\n\r\nPresently, the old man spoke again.\r\n\r\n“Shay, Prof esh, \u0027d ye mind doin\u0027 somethin\u0027 for me?”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” Burgess was by nature courteous.\r\n\r\n“If anything sh\u0027d ever happen to me, \u0027d you take care of Dennie? Shay,\r\nwould you?”\r\n\r\n“If I could do anything for her, I would do it,” the young man replied.\r\n\r\n“Somethin\u0027 gonna happen to me. I ain\u0027t shafe. I know I\u0027ll go that way.\r\nBut you\u0027ll be good to Dennie. Now, wouldn\u0027t you? I\u0027d ask Funnybone, but\r\nhe\u0027s no shafer \u0027n I am. No shafer! You\u0027ll be good to Dennie, you said\r\nso. Shay it again!”\r\n\r\nBond was standing now bending threateningly toward Burgess, who had also\r\nrisen.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll do all that a gentleman ought to do.” He had only one thought--to\r\npacify the drunken man and get away. And the old man understood.\r\n\r\n“Shwear it, I tell you! Lif\u0027 up your right hand an\u0027--an\u0027 shwear to take\r\ncare of Dennie, or I\u0027ll kill you!” Bond insisted.\r\n\r\nHe was a large, muscular man, towering over the slender young professor\r\nlike a very giant, and in his eyes there was a cruel gleam. Vincent\r\nBurgess was at the limit of mental resistance. Lifting his shapely right\r\nhand in the shadowy light, he said wearily:\r\n\r\n“I swear it!”\r\n\r\n“One more question, and you may go. You know that little boy Vic\r\nBurleigh takes care of here?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor had heard of him.\r\n\r\n“Vic keeps that little boy all right. He don\u0027t complain none. S\u0027pose you\r\nhelp me watch um, Profesh.” Then as an afterthought, Saxon added: “Young\r\nwoman livin\u0027 out north of town. Pretty woman. She don\u0027t know nothing\r\n\u0027bout that little boy. Now, honest, she don\u0027t. Lives all by herself with\r\na big dog.”\r\n\r\nJealousy is an ugly, suspicious beast. Vincent Burgess was no worse than\r\nmany other men would have been, because his mind leaped to the meaning\r\nold Saxon\u0027s words might carry. And this was the man with Elinor in the\r\ndarkness and the storm. Before Burgess could think clearly, Saxon came a\r\nstep nearer.\r\n\r\n“Shay, where\u0027s Vic tonight?”\r\n\r\n“Across the river with Miss Wream. They were cut off by the deep water,”\r\n Vincent answered.\r\n\r\nA quick change from drunkenness to sober sense leaped into Bond Saxon\u0027s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Across the river! Great God!” Then sternly, with a grim set of jaw, he\r\ncommanded: “You go home! If you dare to say a word, I\u0027ll kill you. If\r\nyou try to follow me, he\u0027ll kill you. Go home! I \u0027m going over there, if\r\nI die for it.” And the darkness and rain swallowed him as he leaped away\r\nto the westward!\r\n\r\nBurgess gazed into the blackness into which Bond Saxon had gone until a\r\nsoft hand touched his, and he looked down to see little Bug Buler, clad\r\nin his nightgown, standing barefoot beside him.\r\n\r\n“Where\u0027s Vic?” Bug demanded.\r\n\r\n“I don\u0027t know,” Burgess answered.\r\n\r\n“Take me up, I\u0027se told.” Bug stretched up his arms appealingly, and\r\nBurgess, who knew nothing of babies, awkwardly lifted him up.\r\n\r\n“Tuddle me tlose like Vic do,” and the little one snuggled lovingly in\r\nthe Professor\u0027s embrace. “Your toat\u0027s wet. Is Vic wet, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, little boy. We are all in trouble tonight.” Burgess had to say\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n“In twouble? Umph--humph!” Bug shut his lips tightly, puffing out his\r\ncheeks, as was his habit. “I was in twouble, and I ist wented to Don\r\nFonnybone. He\u0027s dood for twouble-ness. You go see him. Poor man!” and\r\nthe little hand stroked Professor Burgess\u0027 feverish cheek.\r\n\r\n“If you\u0027ll run right back to bed, I\u0027ll do it,” Burgess declared. “We\r\ncan learn even from children sometimes,” he thought, as Bug climbed down\r\nobediently and toddled away.\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess went directly to Dr. Lloyd Fenneben, to whom he told the\r\nstory of the day\u0027s events, including the interview with Bond Saxon.\r\nHe did not repeat Bond\u0027s words regarding Vic, but only hinted at the\r\nsuspicion that there was something questionable in the situation in\r\nwhich Vic was placed. Nor did he refer to the old man\u0027s maudlin demand\r\nthat he should take care of Dennie if she were left fatherless, and of\r\nhis sworn promise to do so.\r\n\r\nBurgess felt as, if the Dean\u0027s black eyes would burn through him,\r\nso steady was their gaze while the story was being told. When he had\r\nfinished, Lloyd Fenneben said quietly:\r\n\r\n“You are worn out with the excitement of the day and night. Go home and\r\nrest now. I\u0027ve learned through many a struggle, that what I cannot\r\nfight to a finish in the darkness, I can safely leave with God till the\r\ndaylight comes.”\r\n\r\nThe smile that lighted up the stern face and the firm handclasp with\r\nwhich Lloyd Fenneben dismissed the young man were things he remembered\r\nlong afterward. And above all, he recalled many times a sense of secret\r\nshame that he should have felt degraded because of his association with\r\nDennie Saxon on this day. But of this last, the memory was stronger than\r\nthe present realization.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the mad waters surged around the bend in the river, and\r\nswept over the shallows, Victor Burleigh flung his arm around Elinor\r\nWream and leaped back from the very edge of doom.\r\n\r\n“We must climb the bluff again. Be a good Indian!” he cried, groping for\r\na footing.\r\n\r\nClimbing the west bluff by daylight for the sake of adventure was very\r\nunlike this struggle in the darkness to escape the widening river, with\r\na wind-driven torrent of rain sweeping down the land behind the first\r\nstorm-fury, and Elinor Wream clung to her companion\u0027s arm almost\r\nhelpless with fear.\r\n\r\n“Do you think you can ever get us out? she asked, as the limestone ledge\r\nblocked the way.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what my mother named me?” The carelessness of the tone was\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\n“Victor!” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Then don\u0027t forget it,” Burleigh said. “It\u0027s a dreadfully rough way\r\nbefore us, little girl, but we\u0027ll soon be safe from the river. Don\u0027t\r\nmind this little bit of a storm, and you\u0027ll get personally conducted\r\ninto Lagonda Ledge before midnight.”\r\n\r\nIn her sheltered life, Elinor had never known anything half so dreadful\r\nas this storm and darkness and booming flood, but the fearlessness of\r\nthe strong man beside her inspired her to do her best. It was only two\r\nhours since they were here before. How could she know that these two\r\nhours had marked the crisis of a lifetime for Victor Burleigh. With a\r\nfriendly little pressure on his arm, she said bravely:\r\n\r\n“I\u0027d rather be here with you than over the river with anybody else. I\r\nfeel safer here.”\r\n\r\nVic knew she meant only to be courteous, but the words were comforting.\r\nOn the crest of the ledge the fierceness of the storm was revealed.\r\nGreat sheets of wind-blown rain were flung athwart the landscape, and\r\nthe utter blackness that followed the lightning\u0027s glare, and the roaring\r\nof the wind and river were appalling.\r\n\r\nIn all this tumult, away to the northeast, the beacon light above the\r\nSunrise dome was cutting the darkness with a steady beam.\r\n\r\n“See that light, Elinor? We are not lost. We must get up stream a little\r\nway. Then we\u0027ll find the bridge, all right. The crowd will get home\r\nahead of us, because this is the rough side of the river.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a comfort a light can be!” Elinor murmured as she looked up\r\nand caught the welcome gleam.\r\n\r\nAs they hurried along, the Sunrise light suddenly disappeared and they\r\nfound themselves descending a rough downward way. Presently there\r\nwere rock walls on either side hemming them in a narrow crevice in the\r\nledges. Then the rain ceased and Vic knew they had slidden down into a\r\nrock-covered fissure, that they were getting underground. They tried\r\nto turn back, but the up-climb was impossible, and in the darkness they\r\ncould reach nothing but the sharp ledge of the cliff sheer above the\r\nraging river. Entrapped and bewildered, Vic felt cautiously about; but\r\nthe only certain things were the straight bluff overhanging the flood,\r\nand the cavernous way leading downward; while the same deluge that was\r\nkeeping Vincent Burgess storm-staid on the veranda of the Saxon House,\r\nwas beating mercilessly down on Elinor Wream.\r\n\r\n“We can\u0027t stay here and be threshed to pieces,” Vic cried. “This crack\r\nis drier, anyhow, and it must lead to somewhere.”\r\n\r\nIt did lead to what seemed to Elinor an endless length of hideous\r\nuncertainty, until Vic suddenly lost his footing and plunged headlong\r\ndown somewhere into the blackness of darkness. Elinor shrieked in terror\r\nand sank down limply on the stone floor of the crevice.\r\n\r\n“All a bluff,” Vic called up cheerily, in the same startlingly deep\r\nsweet voice that had caught Elinor\u0027s ear on the September afternoon\r\nbefore the door of Sunrise, and out in the edge of her consciousness\r\nthe thought played in again, “I\u0027d rather be here with you than over the\r\nriver with anybody else. I feel safer here.”\r\n\r\n“Slide down, Elinor. I\u0027ll catch you. It is n\u0027t very far, and there\u0027s a\r\nlittle light somewhere.”\r\n\r\nElinor slipped blindly down the side of the rock into Vic Burleigh\u0027s\r\noutstretched arms. As he set her on her feet, somehow, the little light\r\nfailed. In all their struggle, this part of the way seemed the darkest,\r\nthe chillest, the most dangerous, and a sudden sense of a presence\r\nhidden nearby possessed them both, as they came against a blind wall. A\r\nstouter heart than Vic Burleigh\u0027s might well have quailed now. The two\r\nwere lost underground. What deeper cavern might yawn beyond them? What\r\nlength of dead wall might bar their way? And more terrifying still,\r\nwas the growing sense of a human presence, a human menace, an unseen\r\ntreachery. As Vic felt his way along the stone, his hand closed over\r\nsomething thrust into a little niche, shoulder-high in the wall. It\r\nseemed to be a small pitcher of unique pattern, solid silver by its\r\nweight. Was it the booty of some dead and forgotten robber chief, the\r\nburied treasure of some old Kickapoo raiding tragedy, or the loot of a\r\nliving outlaw?\r\n\r\nVic thought he felt the outline of a letter graven in heavy relief\r\non the smooth side, and, for a reason of his own, dropped the thing.\r\nMercifully, he did not cry out at the discovery, but Elinor felt his\r\nhand on her arm grow chill.\r\n\r\nA dazzling glare, token of the passing of the storm\u0027s fireworks,\r\noutlined an irregular opening in the wall before them, revealing at the\r\nsame time a large room beyond the wall.\r\n\r\n“Here\u0027s the hole where we get out of this trap, Elinor Wream. If such a\r\nbig lightning like that can get in, we can get out,” Vic cried.\r\n\r\nHe crawled through the opening, and pulled her as gently as possible\r\nafter him. Presently, another blaze lit up the night outside, showing\r\na cavern-like space thirty feet in dimensions, with a rock roof above\r\ntheir heads, and a low doorway through which the light from the outside\r\nhad come in, and beyond which the rain was beating tremendously.\r\nEvidently they had found a rear entrance to this cavern.\r\n\r\n“We are past our troubles now, Elinor,” Vic said. “There\u0027s the real\r\nout-of-doors, and I feel sure of the rest of the way. This seems to be\r\na sort of cave, and we have come in kind of irregularly by the back door\r\nor down the chimney. But here we are at the real front door. Shall we go\r\non?”\r\n\r\nElinor leaned wearily against the wall, wet and cold, and almost\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n“Let\u0027s wait a little, till this shower passes,” she pleaded.\r\n\r\n“You poor girl! This has been an awful night,” Vic said gently.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes were getting accustomed to the darkness and they saw more\r\nclearly the outline of the opening to the outside world. Suddenly Elinor\r\nshivered as again the nearness of a presence somewhere possessed them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n“Let\u0027s go! Let\u0027s go!” she whispered, huddling close to her companion,\r\nwhose grip on her arm tightened.\r\n\r\nHe was conscious of a light behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, he\r\ncaught a gleam beyond the opening in the rear wall through which they\r\nhad just crept; and in that gleam, a villainous face, with still black\r\neyes, looking straight at him. The light disappeared, and he heard the\r\nfaint sound of something creeping toward them. Vic could fight any man\r\nliving. Nature built him for that. He had no fear for himself. But here\r\nwas Elinor, and he must think of her first. At that instant, the doorway\r\ndarkened, and a form slipped into the cavern somewhere. Oh, wind and\r\nrain, and forked blue lightning and the thunder\u0027s roar, the river\u0027s\r\nmad floods, the steep, slippery rocks, and jagged ledges, all were kind\r\nbeside this secret human presence, cruelly silent and treacherous.\r\n\r\nVictor Burleigh drew Elinor closer to him, and whispered low:\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t be afraid with me to guard you.”\r\n\r\nEven in that deep gloom, he caught the outline of a white face with\r\nstar-bright eyes lifted toward his face.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m not afraid with you,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nBehind them stealthy movements somewhere. Between them and the doorway,\r\nstealthy movements somewhere; but all so still and slow, they stretched\r\nthe listening nerve almost to the breaking point. Suddenly, a big, hard\r\nhand gripped Burleigh\u0027s shoulder, and a dead still voice, that Vic could\r\nnot recognize, breathed into his ear, “Go quick and quiet! I\u0027ll stand\r\nfor it. Go!”\r\n\r\nIt was old Bond Saxon.\r\n\r\nVic caught Elinor\u0027s arm, and with one stride they sprang from the cave\u0027s\r\nmouth up to the open ground beyond it. Something behind them, it might\r\nhave been a groan or a smothered oath, reached their ears, as they sped\r\naway down a narrow ravine. The rain had ceased and overhead the stars\r\nwere peeping from the edges of feathery flying clouds; and all the\r\nsodden autumn night was still at last, save for the gurgling waters of a\r\nlittle stream down the rocky glen.\r\n\r\nThe Sunrise bell was striking eleven when they reached the bridge\r\nacross the Walnut, and the beacon light from the dome began to twinkle\r\na welcome now and then through the dripping branches of the leafless\r\ntrees. A few minutes later, Victor Burleigh brought Elinor safely to\r\nLloyd Fenneben\u0027s door.\r\n\r\n“We made it in before midnight, anyhow,” he said carelessly.\r\n\r\nElinor looked up in surprise. The terrors of the night still possessed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“What a horrible nightmare it has all been. The storm, the river, the\r\nrocks, and the darkness, and that dreadful something behind us in the\r\ncave. Was there really anything, or did we just imagine it all? It will\r\nseem impossible when the daylight comes.”\r\n\r\nVictor looked at her with a wonderful light in his wide-open brown eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said in a deep voice. “It will seem impossible when daylight\r\ncomes. But will it all be as a horrible nightmare?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; not all.” Elinor\u0027s face was winsomely sweet. “Not all,” she\r\nrepeated. “It is fine to feel one\u0027s self so safeguarded as I have been.\r\nI shall always remember you as one with whom I could never again be\r\nafraid.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh turned hastily toward the door, and, having delivered her to\r\nthe care of her uncle, he bade them both good night.\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben looked keenly after the young man striding away from the\r\nlight. His clothes were torn and bedraggled, his cap was gone, and his\r\nheavy hair was a mass of rough waves about his forehead. The direct\r\ngaze of his golden-brown eyes took away distrust, and yet the face had\r\nchanged somehow in this day. A hint of a new purpose had crept into it,\r\na purpose not possible for Dr. Fenneben to read.\r\n\r\nBut he did note the set of the head, the erect form and broad shoulders,\r\nand the easy swinging step as the boy went whistling away into the\r\nshadows of the night.\r\n\r\n“A splendid animal, anyhow,” the Dean thought. “Will the soul measure\r\nup to that princely body? And what can be the purport of this maudlin\r\nmouthing of old Bond Saxon? Bond is really a lovable man when he\u0027s\r\nsober; but he\u0027s vindictive and ugly when he\u0027s drunk. I can wait for\r\ndevelopments. Whatever the boy\u0027s history may have been, like the courts,\r\nit\u0027s my business to hold every man innocent till he\u0027s proven guilty;\r\nto build up character, not to undermine and destroy it. And destruction\r\nbegins in suspicion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE GAME\r\n\r\n _Truly ye come of The Blood; slower to bless than\r\n     to ban;\r\n Little used to lie down at the bidding of any man_.\r\n                              --KIPLING\r\n\r\nBITTER weather followed the night of the storm. Biting winds beat all\r\nthe autumn beauty from tree and shrub. Cold gray skies hung over a\r\ncold gray land, and a heavy snowfall and a penetrating chill seemed to\r\ndestroy all hope for the Indian Summer that makes the Kansas Novembers\r\nglorious.\r\n\r\nDennie Saxon was the only girl of the party who was not affected by the\r\nstorm at the Kickapoo Corral. Professor Burgess, who narrowly escaped\r\npneumonia himself, and who disliked irregular class attendance, took\r\ncomfort in the sight of Dennie. She was so fresh-checked and wholesome,\r\nand she went about her work promptly, forgetful of storm and rain and\r\nmuddy ways.\r\n\r\n“You seem immune from sickness, Miss Dennie,” Burgess said one day as\r\nshe was putting the library in order.\r\n\r\nUnder her little blue dusting cap, the sunny ripples of her hair framed\r\na face glowing with health. She smiled up at him comfortably--a smile\r\nthat played about the edges of his consciousness all that day.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve never been sick,” she said. “It \u0027s a good thing, too, for our\r\nhouse is a regular hospital this week. Little Bug Buler is the worst\r\nof all. He took cold on the night of the storm. That\u0027s why Victor\r\nBurleigh\u0027s out of school so much. He won\u0027t leave Bug.”\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess despised the name of Burleigh now. While Vic\u0027s safe\r\nescort of Elinor Wream had increased his popularity with the students,\r\nBurgess honestly believed that old Bond Saxon\u0027s drunken speech hinted at\r\nsome disgrace the big freshman would not long be able to conceal, and he\r\nresented the high place given to such a low grade of character. To a man\r\nlike himself it was galling to look upon such a fellow as a rival. So,\r\nhe tightened the rules and exacted the last mental farthing of Vic in\r\nthe classroom. And Vic, easily understanding all this, because he was\r\nfrankly and foolishly in love with the same girl whom Vincent Burgess\r\nseemed to claim, contrived in a thousand ways to make life a burden\r\nto the Harvard man. Of course, Burgess showed no mercy toward Vic for\r\nabsence from the classroom while he was caring for little Bug, and the\r\nblack marks multiplied against him.\r\n\r\nElinor Wream had been ill after the night of the storm. Vic had not\r\nseen her since the hour when he left her at Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s door. He\r\nknew he was a fool to think of her at all. He knew she must sometime be\r\nwon by Burgess, and that she was born to gentle culture which his hard\r\nlife had never known. Besides, he was poor. Not a pauper, but poor,\r\nand luxuries belonged naturally to a girl like Elinor. The storm of the\r\nholiday was a balmy zephyr compared to the storm that raged every day\r\nin him. For with all the hopelessness of things, he was in love.\r\nPoor fellow! The strength of his spirit was like the strength of his\r\nbody--unbreakable.\r\n\r\nHe had no fear of pneumonia after the stormy night, for he was used to\r\nhard knocks. And he meant to go again by daylight and explore the rocky\r\nglen and hidden ways, and to find out, if possible, whose face it was\r\nthat was behind that cavern wall, whose voice had whispered in his ear,\r\nand what loot was hidden there. For reasons of his own, he had mentioned\r\nthis matter to nobody. But the cold, wet days, little Bug\u0027s illness,\r\nand the hard study to keep up his class standing, took all of his\r\ntime. Especially, the study, that he might not be shut out of the great\r\nfootball game of the year on Thanksgiving day. Sunrise was stiff in\r\nits scholastic requirements, and conscientious to the last degree. The\r\nfootball team stood on mental ability and moral honor, no less than on\r\nscientific skill and muscular weight and cunning. Dr. Fenneben watched\r\nBurleigh carefully, for the boy seemed to be always on his heart. The\r\nDean knew how to mix common sense and justice into his rulings, so the\r\nword was sent quietly from the head office--the suggestion of leniency\r\nin the matter of Burleigh\u0027s absence. Burleigh was good for it. It\r\nlay with his professors, of course, to grant or withhold scholarship\r\nranking, but the Dean would be pleased to have all latitude given in\r\nBurleigh\u0027s case.\r\n\r\nBug was better now, and Vic was burning midnight oil in study, for the\r\nhours of practice for the game were doubled.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before Thanksgiving the coach called Vic aside.\r\n\r\n“Everything is safe. Only one report not in, but it will be in\r\ntomorrow.” the coach declared. “I asked Professor Burgess about your\r\nstanding, and he says your grades are away above average. He\u0027s got\r\nto reckon up your absent marks, but that\u0027s easy. All the teachers\r\nunderstand about that. I guess Dean Funnybone fixed \u0027em. And now, Vic,\r\nthe honor of Sunrise rests on you. If you fail us, we\u0027re lost. Can I\r\ncount on you?”\r\n\r\nThe tiger light was behind the long black lashes under the heavy black\r\nbrows, as Vic shut his white teeth tightly.\r\n\r\n“Count on me!” he said, and turning, he left the coach abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Hey, there, Burleigh, hold on a minute,” Trench, the right guard,\r\ncalled, as Vic was striding up the steep south slope of the limestone\r\nridge. “Say, wind a fellow, will you! You infernal, never-wear-out,\r\nhuman steam engine. I\u0027m on to some things you ought to know. Even a lazy\r\nold scout like I am gets a crack at things once in a while.”\r\n\r\n“Well, get rid of it once in a while, if you really do know anything,”\r\n Vic responded.\r\n\r\n“Say, you\u0027re nervous. Coach says you spend too much time in your\r\nnursery; says you\u0027d better get rid of that little kid.”\r\n\r\n“Tell the coach to go to the devil!” Vic spoke savagely.\r\n\r\n“Say, Coach,” Trench roared down from the hillslope, “Vic says for you\r\nto go to the devil.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till after tomorrow,” the coach shouted back, “and I\u0027ll take you\r\nfellows along if you don\u0027t do your best.”\r\n\r\n“Now, that\u0027s settled, I\u0027ll tell you what I know,” Trench drawled lazily.\r\n“First, Elinor Wream, what Dean Funnybone calls \u0027Norrie,\u0027 is heading the\r\nbunch that\u0027s going to shower us with roses tomorrow, if we win. And\r\nyou know blamed well we\u0027ll win. They came in from Kansas City on the\r\nlimited, just now, the roses did. The shower\u0027s predicted for tomorrow P.\r\nM.”\r\n\r\nA sudden glow lighted Vic\u0027s stern face, and there was no savage gleam in\r\nhis eyes now.\r\n\r\n“Is Elinor well enough to come out tomorrow?”\r\n\r\nHe had been caught unawares. Trench stared at him deliberately.\r\n\r\n“Say, Victor Burleigh.” He spoke slowly. “Don\u0027t do it! DON\u0027T DO IT!\r\nIt will kill a man like you to get in love. Lord pity you! and”--more\r\nslowly still--“Lord pity the fool girl who can\u0027t see the solid gold in\r\nthe rough old nugget you are.”\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s the rest of your news?” Vic asked.\r\n\r\n“I gave the best first. Coach tells me ab-so-lute-lee, you are our only\r\nhope. The hope of Sunrise, tomorrow. You\u0027ve got the beef, the wind, the\r\nspeed, the head, and the will. Oh, you angel child!”\r\n\r\n“The coach is clever,” Vic said carelessly.\r\n\r\n“Burleigh, here\u0027s the rub as well as the Rub-i-con. Dennie Saxon\u0027s wise,\r\nand she tells me--on the side; inside, not outside--that your absent\r\nmarks on Burgess\u0027 map are going to cut you out at the last minute. Don\u0027t\r\nlet Burgess do that, Vic, if you have to kill him. Couldn\u0027t we kidnap\r\nhim and drop him into the whirlpool? Old Lagonda\u0027s interest is about\r\ndue. Dennie just stood her ground today like a cherub, and asked the\r\nHahvahd Univusity man right out about it. I don\u0027t know how she got the\r\nhint, only she\u0027s in all the offices and the library out of hours, you\r\nknow, and when the slim one from Boston, yuh know, said as how he had\r\nto stand firm on the right, yuh know, old Dennie just says straight and\r\nflat, \u0027Professor Burgess, I\u0027m ashamed of you.\u0027 Dennie\u0027s a brick. And do\r\nyou know, Burgess, spite of his cussed thin hide, we\u0027ve got to toughen\r\nfor him out here in Kansas; spite of all that, HE LIKES DENNIE SAXON.\r\nThe oracle hath orked, the sibyl hath sibbed. But say, Vic, if he does\r\ncome down hard on you, what will you do?”\r\n\r\n“Come down hard on him, and play anyhow.”\r\n\r\nThe grim jaw and black frown left no doubt as to Vic\u0027s purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nLate November is idyllic in the Walnut Valley. Autumn\u0027s gold has all\r\nbeen burned in Nature\u0027s great crucible, refining the landscape to a wide\r\nrange from frosted silver to richest Purple. Heliotrope and rose\r\nand amethyst blend with misty pink and dainty gray, and the faint,\r\nindefinable blue-green hue of the robin\u0027s egg, and outlined all in\r\ndelicate black tracery of leafless boughs and darkened waterways. Every\r\nsunrise is a revelation of Infinite Beauty. Every midday, a shadowy soft\r\npicture of Peace. Every sunset a dream of Omnipotent Splendor.\r\n\r\nOn such a November Thanksgiving day, the great game of the season was\r\nplayed on the Sunrise football field, which all the Walnut Valley folks\r\ncame forth to see.\r\n\r\nBy one o\u0027clock Lagonda Ledge was deserted, save for old Bond Saxon, who\r\nsat on his veranda, watching the crowds stream by. At two o\u0027clock the\r\nbleachers were packed, and the side lines were broad and black with\r\na good-natured, jostling crowd. And every minute the numbers were\r\nincreasing. Truly Sunrise had never before known such an auspicious day,\r\nsuch record-breaking gate receipts, nor such sure promise of success.\r\nThe game was called for half-past two. It was three o\u0027clock now and the\r\nline-up had not been formed. Even the gentle wrangle over details and\r\neligibility could hardly have spun out so much time as seemed to the\r\nwaiting throng to be uselessly wasted now. Evidently, something was\r\nwrong. The crowd grew impatient and demanded the cause. Out in the open,\r\nthe two squads were warming up for the fray, while the officials hung\r\nfire in a group by the goal posts and talked threateningly.\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“When will the freight be in?”\r\n\r\n“Merry Christmas!”\r\n\r\nSo the crowd shouted. The songs were worn out, the yell-leaders were\r\nexhausted, and the rooters were hoarse.\r\n\r\n“Where\u0027s Vic Burleigh?” somebody called, and a chorus followed:\r\n\r\n“Burleigh! Burly! Burlee! Come home! Come home! Come home!”\r\n\r\nBut Burleigh did not come.\r\n\r\n“Maybe they are shutting him out,” somebody else suggested, and the\r\nSunrise bleachers took fire. Calls for Burleigh rent the air, roars and\r\nyells that threatened to turn this most auspicious college event into\r\npandemonium, and the jolly company into a veritable mob.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, as the teams were leaving their quarters early in the\r\nafternoon, the coach said to Vic:\r\n\r\n“Run up to Burgess and get your grades, Burleigh. It\u0027s a mere form, but\r\nit will save that gang of game-cocks from getting one over us.”\r\n\r\nIn the rotunda Vic and Vincent met face to face, the country boy in\r\nhis football suit and brown sweater, and the slender young college\r\nprofessor, with faultless tailoring and immaculate linen. Ten minutes\r\nbefore, Burgess had been in Dr. Fenneben\u0027s office, where Elinor Wream\r\nand a group of fair college girls were chattering excitedly.\r\n\r\n“See these roses, Uncle Lloyd.” Elinor was holding up a gorgeous bunch\r\nof American Beauties. “These go to Vic Burleigh when he gets behind\r\nthe goal posts. Cost lots of my Uncle Lloyd\u0027s money, but we had to have\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that the very odor of roses was hateful to Burgess at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“May I speak to you a minute?” Vic said as the two men met in the\r\nrotunda.\r\n\r\nBurgess halted in silence.\r\n\r\n“The coach sent me after your statement of my standing. We\u0027ve got a\r\nbunch of sticklers to fight today.”\r\n\r\n“I have turned in my report,” Burgess responded coldly.\r\n\r\n“So the coach said, all but mine. I\u0027m late. May I have my report now?”\r\n Vic urged, trying to be composed.\r\n\r\n“I have no further report for you.” It was a cold-blooded thing to say,\r\nbut Burgess, though filled with jealousy, was conscientious now in\r\nhis belief that Burleigh was really a low grade fellow, deserving no\r\nleniency nor recognition.\r\n\r\n“But you haven\u0027t given me any standing yet, the coach says.” Vic\u0027s voice\r\nwas dead calm.\r\n\r\n“I have no standing to give you. You are below grade.”\r\n\r\nVic\u0027s eyes blazed. “You dog!” was all he could say.\r\n\r\n“Now, see here, Burleigh, there\u0027s no need to act any ruder than you can\r\nhelp.” Burleigh did not move, nor did he take his yellow brown eyes from\r\nhis instructor\u0027s face. “What have you to say further? I thought you were\r\nin a hurry.” Burgess did not really mean a taunt in the last words.\r\n\r\n“I have this to say.” Victor Burleigh\u0027s voice had a menace in its depth\r\nand power. “You have done this infamous thing, not because I deserve it,\r\nbut because you hate me on account of a girl--Elinor Wream.”\r\n\r\n“Stop!” Vincent Burgess commanded.\r\n\r\n“I forbid you to mention her name. You, who come in here from some\r\nbarren, poverty-stricken prairie home, where good breeding is unknown.\r\nYou, to presume to think of such a girl as Dr. Fenneben\u0027s beautiful\r\nniece, whose reputation was barely saved by old Bond Saxon on the stormy\r\nnight after the holiday. You, who are forced for some reason to care\r\nfor an unknown child. You, whose true character will soon be fully known\r\nhere--if this is what you have to say, you may go,” he added with an\r\nimperious wave of the hand.\r\n\r\nThe meanness of anger is in its mastery. Burgess had meant only to\r\ndiscipline Burleigh, but it was too late for that now. The rotunda was\r\nvery quiet. Everybody was down on the field waiting impatiently for the\r\ngame to begin. Burgess was also impatient. There was a seat waiting for\r\nhim beside Elinor Wream.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m not quite ready to go”--Vic\u0027s fierce voice filled the\r\nrotunda--“because you are going to write my credentials for this game,\r\nand you\u0027ll do it quick, or beg for mercy.”\r\n\r\n“I refuse to consider a word you say.” Burgess was furious now, and the\r\nwhite face and burning eyes of his opponent were unbearable. “I will not\r\ngrant you any credentials, you low-born prize-fighter--”\r\n\r\nA sudden grip of steel held him fast as Vic towered over him. The\r\nsoftened light of the dome of the rotunda, where the Kansas motto, “_Ad\r\nAstra per Aspera_.” adorned the stained glass panes, had never fallen on\r\nsuch a scene as this.\r\n\r\n“See here, Burleigh, you\u0027ll repent this unwarranted attack,” Burgess\r\ncried, trying to free himself. “Brute force will win only among brutes.”\r\n\r\n“That\u0027s the only place I expect to use it,” Vic retorted, tightening his\r\ngrip. “No time for words now. The honor of Sunrise as well as my honor\r\nis at stake, and it\u0027s my right to play in this game, because I have\r\nbroken no laws. I may have no culture except that of a prairie claim;\r\nand I may be poor, and, therefore, presumptuous in daring to mention\r\nElinor Wream\u0027s name to you. But”--the brown eyes were a blazing\r\nfire--“nobody can tell me that any man must rescue a girl from me to\r\nsave her reputation, nor that any dishonor belongs to me because of\r\nlittle Bug Buler. Uncultured, as I am, I have the culture of a\r\ncourage that guards the helpless; and ill-bred, as I may be, I have a\r\ngentleman\u0027s honor wherever a woman\u0027s need calls for my protection.”\r\n\r\nVic\u0027s face was ashy, for his anger matched his love, and both were\r\nparallel to his wonderful physique and endurance. In his fury, the\r\ntemptation to throttle the man who had wronged him was gaining the\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\n“Vic, oh, Vic, they\u0027re waiting for you. Turn on! Don\u0027t hurt him, Vic.”\r\n Bug Buler\u0027s pleading little voice broke the momentary stillness.\r\n\r\nVic\u0027s hand fell nerveless, and Burgess staggered back.\r\n\r\n“Was n\u0027t you dood to Vic? He would n\u0027t hurted you. He never hurted\r\nme.” The innocent face and gentle words held a strange power over each\r\npassion-fired man before him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, Vic Burleigh walked across the gridiron with full\r\ncredentials for his place on the team.\r\n\r\nThe last man to enter the grounds was evidently a tramp, whose slouched\r\nhat half-concealed a dark bearded face.\r\n\r\nAs Vic Burleigh, with Bug clinging to his finger, hurried by the ticket\r\nwindow, the crippled student who sold tickets inside the little roofed\r\nbox called out:\r\n\r\n“Come, stay with me, Bug, till I can go in, too, and I\u0027ll buy you\r\npeanuts.”\r\n\r\nBug studied a moment. Then with a comfortable little “Umph-humph,”\r\n puffing out his pudgy cheeks with tightly tucked-in lips, he let go of\r\nVic\u0027s finger and trotted over to the ticket box.\r\n\r\nThe boy let him inside and turned to the window to see the face of the\r\ntramp close to it. The man paid for a ticket, then, leaning forward,\r\nstared eagerly at the open money box. At the same time, the cripple\r\ncaught sight of a revolver handle in a belt under the shabby coat.\r\nTrust a college boy for headwork. Instantly he seized little Bug by the\r\nshoulders and set him up on the shelf between the window and the money\r\nbox. Bug\u0027s hair was a mop of soft ringlets, and his brown eyes and\r\ninnocent baby face were appealing. The stranger stared hard at the\r\nchild, and with a sort of frightened expression, shot through the gate\r\nand mingled with the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Great protection for a cripple,” the student thought, as he locked the\r\nmoney box. “How strong a baby\u0027s hand may be sometimes! Vic Burleigh\u0027s\r\nbeef can win the game out there, but Bug has saved the day at this end\r\nof the line. That tramp seemed scared at the sight of him.”\r\n\r\n“Funny folks turns to dames,” Bug observed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Buggie, the last one in before you came was a young woman with\r\ngray hair, and she had a big dog with her. They don\u0027t let in dogs, so\r\nhe\u0027s waiting outside somewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe last man who did not go in was Bond Saxon, who came late and found\r\nthe gates deserted. But lying watchful in the open way, was a Great Dane\r\ndog. Old Bond hesitated. It was his lifetime fault to hesitate. Then\r\nhe trotted back home. And, behold, a bottle of whisky was beside his\r\ndoorstep. But to his credit for once, he resisted and smashed the bottle\r\nto bits on the stone step.\r\n\r\nThe day was made for such a game. There was no wind. The glare of the\r\nsun was tempered by a gray mist creeping up the afternoon skies. The\r\nair was crisp enough to prevent languor. The crowded bleachers were\r\ninspiring; the season was rounding out in a blaze of glory for Sunrise.\r\nThe two teams were evenly matched,     And the stern joy that warriors feel\r\n     In foemen worthy of their steel,\r\n spurred each to its best efforts. It was a battle royal, with all the\r\nturns of strategy, and quickness, and straight physical weight, and\r\nsudden shifting of signals, fake plays, forward passes, line bucks, and\r\nsplendid interference, flying tackles, speedy end runs, and magnificent\r\ndefense of goals with lines of invincible strength and spirit.\r\n\r\nWith the kick-off the enemy\u0027s goal was endangered by a fumbled ball,\r\nand within three minutes Trench had torn a hole in the defense, through\r\nwhich the Sunrise team were sending Vic Burleigh for a touchdown. The\r\nbleachers went wild and the grandstand was almost shipwrecked in the\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\n“Burleigh! Burly! Burlee!” shrieked the yell-leader as Vic leaped over\r\nthe goal line and the rooters roared:\r\n\r\n     The Sunrise hope!\r\n     And that\u0027s the dope!\r\n     Never quails!\r\n     Never fails!\r\n     Burleigh! Burly! Burlee!\r\n\r\n\r\nA difficult kick from a sharp angle sent the ball through the air one\r\ninch wide of the goal post, and the bleachers counted five.\r\n\r\nAnd then, came the forward swing again, the struggle for downs, the\r\ngain and loss of territory, until Trench, too heavy for speed, failed\r\nto break through the interference quickly enough to hold a swift little\r\nquarterback, who slipped around the end of the line, and, shaking off\r\nthe tackles, swooped toward the Sunrise goal. The last defense was\r\nthrown headlong, and the field was wide open for the run; and the\r\nquarterback was running for the honor of his team, his school, his\r\nundying fame in the college world. Three yards to the goal line, and\r\nvictory would be his. All Lagonda Ledge held its breath as Vic\r\nBurleigh tore through a tangle of tackles and sprang forward with long,\r\nspace-eating bounds. He seemed to leap through ten feet of air, straight\r\nover the quarterback\u0027s head and land four feet from the goal with the\r\nquarterback in his grip, while a Sunrise halfback out beyond him was\r\nlying on the lost ball.\r\n\r\nThe bleachers now went entirely mad, for from the very edge of disaster,\r\nthe tide of battle was turned into the enemy\u0027s territory. Before the\r\nSunrise rooters had time to cease rejoicing, however, the invincible\r\nquarterback was away again, and with two guards and a center on top of\r\nBurleigh, now the plucky runner broke across the Sunrise line, and a\r\nminute later missed a pretty goal. And the opposing bleachers counted\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the game was filled with a tense, fruitless strife.\r\nFive points to five points, and four minutes of time to play. The\r\nstruggle had ceased to be a turning of tricks and test of speed.\r\nHenceforth, it was man against man, pound for pound. Suddenly, the\r\nopposing team braced itself and began a steady drive down the gridiron.\r\nWith desperate energy, the Sunrise eleven fought for ground, giving way\r\nslowly, defending their goal like true Spartans, dying by inches,\r\nuntil only three yards of space were left on which to die. The rooters\r\nshrieked, and the girls sang of courage. Then a silence fell. Three\r\nyards, and the Sunrise team turned to a rock ledge as invincible as the\r\nlimestone foundation of their beloved college halls. The center from\r\nwhich all strength radiated was Victor Burleigh. Against him the weight\r\nof the line-bucking plunged. If he wavered the line must crumble. The\r\ncrowd hardly breathed, so tense was the strain. But he did not waver.\r\nThe ball was lost and the last struggle of the day began. Two minutes\r\nmore, the score tied, and only one chance was left.\r\n\r\nSince the night of the storm, Vic had known little rest. His days had\r\nbeen spent in hard study, or continuous practice on the field; his\r\nnights in the sick room. And what was more destructive to strength\r\nthan all of this was the newness and grief of a blind, overmastering\r\nadoration for the one girl of all the school impossible to him. The\r\nstrain of this day\u0027s game, as the strain of all the preparation for it,\r\nhad fallen upon him, and the half hour in the rotunda had sapped his\r\nenergy beyond every other force. Love, loss, a reputation attacked,\r\npossible expulsion for assaulting a professor, injustice, anger--oh, it\r\nwas more than a burden of wearied muscles and wracked nerves that he had\r\nto lift in these two minutes!\r\n\r\nIn a second\u0027s pause before the offense began, Vic, who never saw the\r\nbleachers, nor heard a sound when he was in the thick of the game,\r\ncaught sight now of a great splash of glowing red color in the\r\ngrandstand. In a dim way, like a dream of a dream, he thought of\r\nAmerican Beauty roses of which something had been said once--so long\r\nago, it seemed now. And in that moment, Elinor Wream\u0027s sweet face,\r\nwith damp dark hair which the lamplight from Dr. Fenneben\u0027s door was\r\nillumining, and the softly spoken words, “I shall always remember you as\r\none with whom I could never be afraid again”--all this came swiftly\r\nin an instant\u0027s vision, as the team caught its breath for the last\r\nonslaught.\r\n\r\n“Victor, for victory. Lead out Burleigh,” Trench cried to his mates, and\r\nthe sweep of the field was on; and Lagonda Ledge and the whole Walnut\r\nValley remembers that final charge yet. Steady, swift, invincible, it\r\ndrove its strong foe down the white-crossed sod--so like a whirlwind,\r\nthat the watching crowds gazed in bewilderment. Almost before they\r\ncould comprehend the truth, the enemy\u0027s goal was just before the Sunrise\r\nwarriors, and half a minute of time remained in which to play. One more\r\nline plunge with Burleigh holding the ball! A film came before his eyes.\r\nA sudden blankness of failure and despair seized him. In the grandstand,\r\nElinor Wream stood clutching a pennant in both hands, her dark eyes\r\nluminous with proud hope. Amid all the yells and cheers, her sweet voice\r\nrang out:\r\n\r\n“Victor, Victor! Don\u0027t forget the name your mother gave you!”\r\n\r\nVic neither saw nor heard. Yet in that moment, strength and pride\r\nand indomitable will power came sweeping back to him. One last plunge\r\nagainst this wall of defense upreared before him, and Burleigh, with\r\nhalf the enemy\u0027s eleven clinched to drag him back, had hurled himself\r\nacross the goal line and lay half-conscious under a perfect shower of\r\nfragrant crimson roses, while the song of victory in swelling chorus\r\npealed out on the November air. Half a minute later, Trench had kicked\r\ngoal. The bleachers chanted eleven counts, the referee\u0027s whistle blew,\r\nand the game was done!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSACRIFICE\r\n\r\n _The air for the wing of the sparrow,\r\n     The bush for the robin and wren,\r\n But always the path that is narrow\r\n     And straight for the children of men_.\r\n                         --ALICE CARY\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. THE DAY OF RECKONING\r\n\r\n _Oh, it is excellent\r\n To have a giant\u0027s strength, but tyrannous\r\n To use it like a giant_.\r\n                    --SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nOF course, there came a day of reckoning for Victor Burleigh, now the\r\nidol of the Walnut Valley football fans, the pride of Lagonda Ledge, the\r\nhero of Sunrise. But the reckoning was not brought to him; he brought\r\nhimself deliberately to it.\r\n\r\nThe jollification following the game threatened to wreck the chapel and\r\ncrack the limestone ledge beneath it.\r\n\r\n“Dust off your halo and wrap it up in cotton till next fall, Vic,”\r\n Trench whispered in the closing minutes. “We\u0027ve got to face the real\r\nthing now. We\u0027re civilians in citizens\u0027 clothes, amenable to law\r\nhenceforth; not a lot of athletic brigands, privileged outlaws, whose\r\nglory dazzles all common sense. Quit bumping your head against the\r\nKansas motto up in the dome, get your hob-nailers down on the sod,\r\nand trot off and tackle your Greek verbs awhile. And say, Vic, tackle\r\nyourself first and forget the pretty girl who covered you with roses\r\ndown yonder five days ago. It was n\u0027t you, it was just the day\u0027s hero.\r\nShe\u0027d have decorated old Bond Saxon just the same if he had waddled\r\nacross the last goal line then. You\u0027re a plug and she\u0027s a lady born, and\r\nas good as engaged to Burgess besides. I had that straight from Dennie\r\nSaxon, and you know Dennie\u0027s no gossip. They were far gone before they\r\ncame West--the Wream-Burgess folk were--stiffen up, Burleigh. You look\r\nlike a dead man.”\r\n\r\n“I was never more alive in my life.” Vic\u0027s voice and eyes were alive\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n“By heck! I believe it,” Trench exclaimed. “Say, you got away with\r\nBurgess about the game. If you want the girl, go after her, too. But\r\ngently, Sweet Afton, go gently. Most girls want to do the pursuing\r\nthemselves, I believe. I\u0027ll block the interference, if necessary, and\r\nyou\u0027ll be the sought-after yet, not the seeking, dear child.”\r\n\r\nA circular stairway winds from the Sunrise chapel down the south turret\r\nto Dean Fenneben\u0027s study, intended originally as a sort of fire escape.\r\nSome enterprising janitor later fixed a spring lock on the upper door\r\nto this stairway (surprises had been sprung through this door upon the\r\nchapel stage by prankish students at inopportune moments), so that\r\nnow it was only an exit, and was called by the students “the road to\r\nperdition,” easy to descend but barred from retreat.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion following the chapel exercises Vic slipped into the\r\nsouth turret, and the lock clicked behind him as he hurried down “the\r\nroad to perdition.”\r\n\r\nThe door to Dean Fenneben\u0027s study was slightly open and Vic heard his\r\nown name spoken as he reached it. He hesitated, for a group of girls was\r\nsurrounding Elinor Wream, discussing him. There was no escape. The upper\r\ndoor was locked, and he would rather have met that unknown villainous\r\nface in the dark cave than to face this group of pretty girls. So he\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Elinor, you mercenary creature!”\r\n\r\n“What if he is a bit crude?”\r\n\r\n“I don\u0027t blame you. I\u0027m daffy about Professor Burgess myself.”\r\n\r\n“He\u0027s got the grandest voice, Vic has!”\r\n\r\n“I just adore Greek!”\r\n\r\n“I think Vic is splendid!”\r\n\r\nSo the exclamations ran.\r\n\r\n“Now, Norrie Wream, cross your heart, hope you may die, if big, handsome\r\nVictor Burleigh had his corners knocked off, and he was sandpapered down\r\na little, and had money, wouldn\u0027t you feel a whole lot different about\r\nhim, Norrie?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly would. I couldn\u0027t help it.”\r\n\r\nNorrie\u0027s eyes were shining and her cheeks were pink as peach blossoms.\r\nTo Vic she seemed exquisitely beautiful.\r\n\r\n“But now?” somebody queried.\r\n\r\n“Oh, now, she\u0027ll be sensible, and the Professor will take advantage\r\nof \u0027now.\u0027 He won\u0027t wait till it\u0027s too late. Great hat! there goes the\r\nbell.”\r\n\r\nAnd the girls scuttled away.\r\n\r\nVic came in and sat down by the window through which one may find an\r\nempire for the looking.\r\n\r\n“Burgess was right,” he said to himself.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m not only ill-bred on the outside, I\u0027m that way clear through. A\r\ndisreputable eavesdropper! That\u0027s my size. But I didn\u0027t mean it. Fine\r\nexcuse!” He frowned in disgust, and turned to the window.\r\n\r\nThe Thanksgiving weather was still blessing the Walnut Valley. Wide away\r\nbeyond Lagonda Ledge rolled the free open prairies, swept by the free\r\nair of heaven under a beneficent sky.\r\n\r\nAs Vic gazed his stern face softened, and the bulldog look, that he had\r\nworn since the night of the storm, relaxed before some gentler mood. The\r\nbrown eyes held a strange glow under the long black lashes, as if a new\r\npurpose were growing up in the soul behind them.\r\n\r\n“No limit out there. It\u0027s a FREE LAND,” he murmured. “There shall be\r\nno limit in here.” Unconsciously he struck his breast with his fist.\r\n“There\u0027s freedom for such as I am somewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Hello, Burleigh, what can I do for you?” As Dr. Fenneben came into the\r\nstudy he recalled how awkwardly the same boy had filled the same chair\r\nonly a few months before.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve come in to be sentenced,” Vic replied.\r\n\r\n“Well, plead your case first.”\r\n\r\nIf ever a father-heart beat in a bachelor\u0027s breast, Lloyd Fenneben had\r\nsuch a heart.\r\n\r\n“I want to settle about Thanksgiving Day,” Vic said. “I had a moral\r\nright to play on the team in that game, but I had to get the legal right\r\nby force. Professor Burgess refused to permit me to play until I MADE\r\nhim do it.”\r\n\r\nFenneben\u0027s eyes were smiling. “Why didn\u0027t you knock him down and fight\r\nit out with him?”\r\n\r\n“Because he\u0027s not in my class. When I fight I fight men. And, besides, I\r\nwas in a hurry. If I\u0027m expected to apologize to Professor Burgess or be\r\nexpelled, I want to know it,” Vic added, hotly.\r\n\r\nHe knew he would not apologize, and he wanted the sentence of expulsion\r\nto come quickly if it must come.\r\n\r\n“We never expel boys from Sunrise. They have done it themselves\r\nsometimes. Nor do we ever exact an apology. They offer it themselves\r\nsometimes. In either case, the choice lies with the boy.”\r\n\r\n“What do you do with a fellow like me?” Vic looked curiously at the\r\nDean.\r\n\r\n“If a boy of your build wants to meet only men when he fights, we take\r\nit he is something of a man himself, and therefore worth too much for\r\nSunrise to lose.”\r\n\r\nOh! blessed power of the college man to lead the half-tamed boy into the\r\nstronger places of life; nor shove him to the dangerous ground where his\r\nfeet must sink in the quicksand or the mire!\r\n\r\nVic sat looking thoughtfully at the man before him.\r\n\r\n“Your confession here is all right. Your claim to a place on the team in\r\nThursday\u0027s game was just.” The simple fairness of Fenneben\u0027s words made\r\ntheir appeal, yet, it was so unlike what Vic had counted on he could\r\nhardly accept it as genuine.\r\n\r\n“You have made a great name for yourself as an athlete. I paid for the\r\nroses. I know something of the degree of that greatness.” Dr. Fenneben\r\nsmiled genially. “You played a marvelous game and I am proud of you.”\r\n\r\nVic did not look proud of himself just then, and Lloyd Fenneben knew it\r\nwas one of life\u0027s crucial moments for the boy.\r\n\r\n“The big letter S cut over the doorway out there stands for more than\r\nSunrise, you remember I told you.” Fenneben spoke earnestly. “It means\r\nalso the strife which you have already met and must expect to meet\r\nall along the way. But, Burleigh”--Lloyd Fenneben stood up to his full\r\nheight, an ideal of grace and power--“if you expect to make your way\r\nthrough college with your fists, come to me.”\r\n\r\n“You?” Vic\u0027s eyes widened.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I\u0027ll meet you on any grounds. And if you ever try to coerce a\r\nprofessor here again, I\u0027ll meet you anyhow, and we\u0027ll have it out.”\r\n Fenneben was stern now.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn\u0027t want to scrap with you, Dr. Fenneben,” Vic stammered.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I am too much of a gentleman for that.”\r\n\r\n“When I fight, I fight men. You are in my class,” Fenneben quoted with a\r\nsmile in his eyes, which faded away with the next words.\r\n\r\n“You are right, Burleigh. A gentleman does n\u0027t want to use his strength\r\nlike a beast to destroy. The only legitimate battle is when a man must\r\nfight with a man as he would fight with a beast, to save himself, or\r\nsomething dearer to him than himself, from beastly destruction. Get into\r\nthe bigger game, my boy, where the strife is for larger scores, and\r\nadd to a proud athletic record, the prouder record of self-control. The\r\nprairies have given you a noble heritage, but culture comes most from\r\ncontact with cultured men. Don\u0027t take on airs because you have more\r\nred blood than our Harvard man. The influence of the great universities,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, on a life like yours is essential to your\r\nusefulness and power. You may educate your conscience to choose the\r\nright before the wrong, but, remember, an educated conscience does not\r\nalways save a man from being a fool now and then. He needs an educated\r\nbrain sometimes by which to save his soul. Meantime, settle with your\r\nconscience, if you owe it anything. It is a troublesome creditor. I\u0027ll\r\nleave you now to square yourself with that fellow you must live with\r\nevery day--Victor Burleigh. We\u0027ll drop everything else henceforth and\r\nface toward tomorrow, not yesterday.”\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben grasped the boy\u0027s hand in a firm, assuring grip and left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“If Sunrise means Strife, I\u0027ll face it,” Vic said to himself. “As to\r\nmoney, I have only my two hands and that old mortgaged quadrangle of\r\nprairie sod out West. But if culture like Fenneben\u0027s might win Elinor\r\nWream, God help me to win it.”\r\n\r\nUp in the library a week later Professor Burgess came in while Dennie\r\nSaxon was putting the books in order. Burgess was often to be found\r\nwhere Dennie was, but Burgess himself had not noted it, and nobody else\r\nknew it, except Trench. Trench was a lazy fellow, who always lived in\r\nthe middle of his pasture, where the feeding was good. That gave him\r\ntime to study mankind as it worried about the outer edges.\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t you get tired sometimes, Miss Dennie?” the Professor asked. He\r\nwas not happy himself for many reasons, and two of them were Elinor and\r\nVic, who separately, and differently, seemed to wear out his energy.\r\nDennie Saxon never wore on anybody\u0027s nerves.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, often,” Dennie answered.\r\n\r\n“Why do you do this?” he queried.\r\n\r\n“To get my college education.” Dennie smiled, hopefully. “I like the\r\nnice things and nice ways of life. So I\u0027m working for them.”\r\n\r\n“Elinor has all these without working for them,” Vincent thought.\r\n\r\nThen for no reason at all his mind leaped to Dennie\u0027s father and his own\r\nvow on the stormy night in October.\r\n\r\n“What would you do if your father were taken from you, Miss Dennie?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve always had to depend on myself somewhat. I would keep on, I\r\nsuppose.” Dennie looked up bravely. Her father was her joy and her\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nWell, what had Burgess expected? That she would depend on him? He was in\r\nlove with Elinor Wream. Why should he feel disappointed? And why should\r\nhis eye follow the soft little ripples of her sunny hair, giving a\r\npretty outline to her face and neck.\r\n\r\n“Could you really take care of yourself? He was talking at random.\r\n\r\n“I might do like that woman out at Pigeon Place.” Burgess did n\u0027t catch\r\nthe pathos in Dennie\u0027s tone. He was only a man.\r\n\r\n“How\u0027s that?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, live alone and keep a big dog, and sell chickens. That\u0027s what Mrs.\r\nMarian does. By the way, she looks just a little bit like you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!”\r\n\r\n“She was at the game on Thanksgiving Day, strange to say, for she seldom\r\nleaves home. Did you see a pretty white-haired woman, right south of\r\nwhere we were?”\r\n\r\n“Is that how I look? No, I didn\u0027t see her. I was n\u0027t at the game.”\r\n\r\n“You weren\u0027t? Why not? You missed a wonderful thing.”\r\n\r\nAnd Burgess told her the whole story from his viewpoint, of course. What\r\nhe was too proud to mention to Dr. Fenneben or Elinor he spoke of freely\r\nto Dennie, and he felt as if the weight of the limestone ledge was\r\nlifted from him with the telling.\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t you think the young ruffian was pretty hard on me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No, I don\u0027t,” Dennie said, frankly. “I think you were pretty hard on\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nA sudden resolve seized Burgess. He came around to Dennie\u0027s side of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“Miss Dennie, I want to tell you something, unimportant in itself, but\r\nbetter shared than kept. On the night of our picnic in October your\r\nfather, who was not quite himself--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand,” Dennie said, with downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Dennie, I would not hurt your feelings.” His voice was very\r\ngentle, and Dennie looked up gratefully. “On that night your father made\r\nme promise--made me hold up my hand and swear--I\u0027m easily forced, you\r\nwill think--to look after you if he were taken away. I did it to pacify\r\nhim, not to ever embarrass you. He also told me enough about young\r\nBurleigh to make me wish, in the office of protector, to warn you.”\r\n\r\n“Was my father quite himself then?” Dennie asked.\r\n\r\n“Not quite,” Burgess replied.\r\n\r\n“Listen to him some day when he is. He is another man then. But,” she\r\nadded, “I know you mean well.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of her courage her eyes were full of tears, and for the first\r\ntime in his sheltered pleasant life the real spirit of sympathy woke in\r\nthe soul of Vincent Burgess.\r\n\r\n“You are a brave, good girl, Dennie. If I can ever serve you in any way,\r\nit will be a privilege to me to do it.”\r\n\r\nTen minutes after they had left the library Trench, who had been\r\nstationary in the north alcove, slowly came to life. He had been posing\r\nas a statue, Winged Victory with a head on, he declared afterward to Vic\r\nBurleigh, to whom he told the whole story.\r\n\r\n“Let me sing my swan song,” he declared. “Then me for Lagonda\u0027s\r\nwhirlpool. I\u0027m not fit to live in a decent community, a blithering idiot\r\nand rascally villain, who lies in wait to hear and see like a fool.\r\nI thought Dennie knew I was there and would be in to dust me out in\r\na minute. And when it was too late I turned to a pillar of salt and\r\nwaited. But I believe I\u0027ll change my mind, after all. I\u0027ll live; and if\r\nProfessor Burgess, A.B. of Cambridge-by-the-bean-patch, dares to make\r\nlove to Dennie Saxon--on the side--he\u0027ll go head foremost into the\r\nwhirlpool to feed Lagonda\u0027s rapacious spirit. I\u0027ve said it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. LOSS, OR GAIN?\r\n\r\n _We cannot make bargains for blisses,\r\n     Nor catch them like fishes in nets,\r\n And sometimes the thing our life misses\r\n     Helps more than the thing which it gets_.\r\n                         --CARY\r\n\r\nELINOR WREAM spent the holidays in the East and was two weeks late\r\nin entering school again. Then her Uncle Lloyd tightened the rules,\r\nexacting full measure for lost time, until she bewailed to her girl\r\nfriends that she had no opportunity even to make fudge or wash her hair.\r\n\r\n“Were you sorry to come back, then, Norrie?” her uncle asked one evening\r\nwhen they were alone in their library, and Elinor was lamenting her hard\r\nlot.\r\n\r\n“No, I want to be with you, Uncle Lloyd.”\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the arm of his morris chair, softly stroking his\r\nheavy hair away from his forehead.\r\n\r\n“Looks like it, the way you hurried back,” Dr. Fenneben said, smiling.\r\n\r\n“But Uncle Joshua is n\u0027t well, although, to be honest, he didn\u0027t seem\r\na bit anxious to have me stay. He\u0027s so wrapped up in Sanscrit he has no\r\ntime to live in the present. Why didn\u0027t he ever marry?”\r\n\r\n“You have just said why,” her uncle answered her.\r\n\r\n“Why did n\u0027t you ever marry. Were you ever in love?”\r\n\r\nThe library lamp cast only a shaded light over Lloyd Fenneben lounging\r\ncomfortably in his chair. To a woman\u0027s eye he would have seemed the\r\npicture of an ideal husband.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was in love once. I did n\u0027t marry because--because--I didn\u0027t.”\r\n\r\n“How romantic! Was it unrequited, or money, or what?” Norrie asked,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Or what,” he answered, and her finer sense made her change the subject.\r\n\r\n“Say, Uncle Lloyd, Uncle Joshua says he wants me to marry.”\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s he up to now? Tell me about it.”\r\n\r\nNorrie was charming tonight in a dainty red evening gown that set off\r\nher pretty face, crowned with beautiful dark hair. Somehow the sight of\r\nher made deeper the void in Fenneben\u0027s life--since that love affair of\r\nhis own long ago.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Norrie went on, “Uncle says I\u0027m to marry rich, because my papa\r\nexpected me to. He said papa had money which was mamma\u0027s and he used it\r\nfor college endowments, because the Wreams love colleges best, and that\r\nit was his wish, and it\u0027s Uncle Joshua\u0027s too, that I should marry well.\r\nI knew I came honestly by my love of spending. I inherited it from my\r\nmother. Aren\u0027t the Wreams all funny men to just see nothing in money,\r\nbut a cap and gown and a Master\u0027s Degree? But you are a human being,\r\nUncle Lloyd. You wouldn\u0027t leave a daughter dependent on her uncles and\r\nuse her money to endow colleges, would you?” The white arm stole round\r\nhis neck affectionately, as Elinor added softly, “I\u0027m going to tell you\r\nsomething else. Uncle Joshua wants me to marry Professor Burgess.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to marry him?” Fenneben asked.\r\n\r\n“He hasn\u0027t asked me to yet. But he is such a gentleman and he has a\r\nfortune in his own name, or in trust, or something like that. It would\r\nplease the Cambridge folks, and Uncle Joshua expects me to consent,\r\nand I\u0027ve never disobeyed uncle\u0027s wishes, so I couldn\u0027t refuse now. And,\r\nwell, if he\u0027ll wait till I\u0027m ready, I guess it will suit me.”\r\n\r\n“He\u0027ll wait all right, if he wants you, Norrie. He must wait until you\r\ngraduate,” the Dean declared.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; a Wream without a college diploma is like a ship without a\r\ncompass, a mere derelict on life\u0027s sea. I\u0027m in no hurry anyhow,” and she\r\nbegan to talk of other things.\r\n\r\nIn the months that followed Trench had no need to watch Professor\r\nBurgess in his relation to Dennie Saxon, for Burgess had no thought of\r\nher other than of kindly sympathy. That is, Burgess thought he had no\r\nthought. He knew he was in love with Elinor, knew that back in Cambridge\r\nbefore he was graduated from the university. He had been told that\r\nElinor liked luxurious living, and he had money--he had told Fenneben as\r\nmuch in their first interview. Everything seemed to be settled now, for\r\nJoshua Wream had written Burgess the kind of letter only a very old man,\r\nand an abstract scholar, and a bachelor would ever write, telling all\r\nthat he had said to Norrie. He made it obligatory that Fenneben should\r\nfirst give his sanction to the union. He requested also that Burgess\r\nwould never mention this letter to his dear young niece, and he\r\nexpressly stipulated that Norrie should graduate at Sunrise first. He\r\nended with an old man\u0027s blessing and with the assurance that with Elinor\r\nsafely provided for his conscience (why his conscience?) would be at\r\nrest, and he could die in peace. So there was smooth sailing at Sunrise\r\nfor many months. Elinor was always charming, and Dr. Fenneben seemed\r\noblivious to the situation, least of all to putting up any objection,\r\nwhich, according to brother Joshua, would have blocked the game of love.\r\nThere was time now for profound research, the study of types, seclusion,\r\nand the advantage of geographical breath which had brought the Professor\r\nto Kansas, and which he heeded less and less with the passing days. For\r\nhe found himself more and more living in the lives of the students. He\r\nhad been ashamed, once, of having been Dennie Saxon\u0027s escort; and he\r\nnever knew when she came to be the one person in Lagonda Ledge to whom\r\nhe turned for confidence and aid in many things.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the big boy from the western claim was as surely going up the\r\nrounds of culture as the Professor was coming down to the common needs\r\nof common minds, and both were unconscious then that back of each was\r\nDr. Fenneben, “dear old Funnybone” to the student body, playing each\r\nman for his king row in the great game of life fought out in\r\nSunrise-by-the-Walnut.\r\n\r\nToward Elinor, Victor Burleigh seemed utterly indifferent. Even Lloyd\r\nFenneben, who had caught an insight into things on the night of the\r\nOctober storm, and had begun to read that new line in the boy\u0027s face,\r\nfailed to grasp what lay back of those innocent-looking, wide-open eyes,\r\nwhose tiger-golden gleam showed but rarely now. Vic was easily the\r\nmost popular fellow in his class, and the year at Sunrise had worked a\r\nmarvelous change in him.\r\n\r\n“You are a darned smooth citizen,” Trench drawled, as he and Burleigh\r\nstood in the shade by the campus gate on the closing day of their\r\nfreshman year.\r\n\r\nA group of girls had been bidding the two good-bye for the summer. As\r\nElinor Wream, who was the last one of the company, offered her hand to\r\nVic there was a look of expectancy in her glance which found no response\r\nin his own eyes. As he turned away with indifferent courtesy to Trench,\r\nthe big right guard stared hard at him.\r\n\r\n“You are a--well, any kind of a smooth citizen, I say,” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“What\u0027s troubling your liver now?” Vic asked.\r\n\r\nTrench did not heed the question, but said, slowly: “And-the-big-noble-\r\nhearted-young-fellow-walked-in-and-out-beside-how-the-touch-of-her-hand-\r\nthrilled-his-every-pulse-beat,-and-how-her-smile-was-the-light-of-his-\r\nsoul. And-he-grew-handsomer-and-more-beloved-with-the-passing-manhood--”\r\n\r\nA sudden clutch on Trench\u0027s arm, the blaze of the old-time fury in\r\nburning eyes, as Vic\u0027s hoarse voice cried:\r\n\r\n“For God\u0027s sake, Trench, get out of my sight!”\r\n\r\n“I will,” drawled Trench. “The only friend you ever had. I\u0027ll carry my\r\ntroubles up to Big Chief Funnybone. Like as not he\u0027ll sentence me to\r\ntumble you through the chapel door of the south turret down the \u0027road to\r\nperdition.\u0027 No use though, you go that road every day. Better treat me\r\nright and tell me all your troubles. If there is any cool handle to take\r\nhold of Gehanna by next to Funnybone, I\u0027m the one fellow in Sunrise to\r\ngrab onto it.”\r\n\r\nBut Vic was out of hearing.\r\n\r\nAnd the days of a long, hot Kansas summer, a glorious autumn, and a\r\nshort, nippy winter swung by in their appointed seasons. And now the\r\nspringtime was unrolling in dainty beauty of tender green leaf, and\r\ngrowing grass, and warm, sweet air, and trill of song bird. College\r\nstudents philosophize little in the springtime of their sophomore year.\r\nHaving learned all that books can teach, and a little more, they seek\r\nother pastime. Nobody in Sunrise except Dr. Fenneben took the time to\r\nremember how stiff and ungenial Professor Burgess was when he first came\r\nWest; nor what an awkward gosling Victor Burleigh was the day he entered\r\nSunrise; nor that once it could have seemed just a little odd to invite\r\nDennie Saxon, a poor student, daughter of a half-reformed drunkard, to\r\nthe class parties; nor that even Elinor Wream, “Norrie the beloved,” was\r\nnot supposed to be engaged to Vincent Burgess. Supposed! And that, when\r\nher senior year was well along, the engagement would be openly spoken of\r\nas now in her sophomore year, it was quietly accepted, even if Professor\r\nBurgess was often Dennie Saxon\u0027s escort. That was because he was such a\r\ngentleman. Nor that with all these changes Trench had remained the same\r\nold lazy Trench, the comfortable idol of the girls, for he was right\r\nguard to all of them, and cared for none. And they never knew till\r\nafterward that for all the four years he was faithful to a little\r\nsweetheart out in the sandy Cimarron River country, to whom he took\r\nback clean hands and a pure heart, when he went home after four years of\r\ncollege life.\r\n\r\nNone of these things were noted especially, save by Dr. Lloyd Fenneben,\r\nand he wasn\u0027t a sophomore nor a professor in love with a pretty girl; a\r\nprofessor learning for the first time that sympathy has also its culture\r\nvalue, as well as perfectly translated Horace, and that the growth of\r\na human soul means something as beautiful as the growth of a complete\r\nconjugation on an old Greek stem from an older Greek root. Fenneben had\r\nlearned all this while he was chasing about the Kansas prairies with a\r\ncollege in his vest pocket.\r\n\r\nThere were some unchanged things, however, which Fenneben only guessed\r\nat. Victor Burleigh had never apologized to Professor Burgess for his\r\nrude attack, unless a certain strained dignified courtesy be the mark of\r\na tacit apology. And Burgess could give only cold recognition to the big\r\nfellow who had choked him into submission and had gone unpunished by the\r\ncollege authorities.\r\n\r\nBetween these two Fenneben guessed there was no change. But he did not\r\ngrieve deeply. There must be a personal phase in this grudge that no\r\nthird person could handle. It might be a girl--but the face of the\r\nreturns indicated otherwise. Meanwhile the college was doing its perfect\r\nwork for Burleigh, whose strength of mind, and self-control, and growing\r\ngraciousness of manner betokened the splendid manhood that should rest\r\non this foundation. While the spirit of the prairie sod, the benediction\r\nof the broad-sweeping air of heaven, and the sturdy, wholesome life\r\nof the sons and daughters of freedom-loving, broad-spirited men and\r\nwomen--all were giving to Vincent Burgess a new happiness in his work\r\nunlike any pleasure he had ever known before.\r\n\r\nLittle Bug Buler, now four years of age, had changed least of all among\r\nchanging things about Lagonda Ledge. A sweet-faced, quaint little fellow\r\nhe was, with big appealing eyes, a baby lisp to his words, and innocent\r\nways. He was a sturdy, pudgy, self-reliant youngster, however, who took\r\nlong rambles alone and turned up safe at the right moment. All Lagonda\r\nLedge petted him, even to Burgess, who never forgot the day in the\r\nrotunda when Bug\u0027s pitying voice had broken Burleigh\u0027s grip on his neck.\r\n\r\nBond Saxon had not changed, nor the white-haired woman of Pigeon\r\nPlace--nor the reputation of the ravines and rocky coverts for hiding\r\nlaw breakers across the Walnut River. And Fenneben noted often the\r\nslender blue smoke rising where nobody had a house.\r\n\r\nIt was an April day in the Walnut Valley, with all the freshness of the\r\nearth just washed and perfumed by April showers. The sunshine was pale\r\ngold. There was a gray-green filmy light from budding trees, and the\r\nold-time miracle of the grass was wrought out once more before the eyes\r\nof men. The orchards along the Walnut were faintly pink, and the eggs in\r\nthe robin\u0027s nest, the south winds purring through the wooded spaces, the\r\nodor of far-plowed furrows on the prairie farms, all gave assurance\r\nof the year\u0027s gladdest days. From the Sunrise ledge the beauty of the\r\nlandscape was exquisite. There was no haze overhanging the earth now,\r\nand the Walnut Valley was a picture beyond a Master\u0027s dream. Victor\r\nBurleigh sat on the top of the flight of steps leading from the lower\r\ncampus, looking lazily out with dreamy eyes on all that the earth had to\r\ngive on this sweet April afternoon.\r\n\r\nPresently Elinor Wream came around the north angle of the building,\r\nhesitated a little, then walked straight to the steps.\r\n\r\n“Good afternoon, Victor,” she said.\r\n\r\nBurleigh looked up, glad then of his months of discipline and\r\nself-control. A sight good for anybody on a day like this was this\r\ncollege girl with beautiful dark hair and laughing dark eyes, a satiny\r\npink and white complexion, and a slender form, clad just now in dainty\r\npink gingham with faint little edgings of white and pale green, all\r\nstylishly put together to reveal rounded arms, and white neck, and\r\ndimpled chin.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Elinor,” Vic said, calmly, making room for her on the stone\r\nsteps. “Take a seat.”\r\n\r\nElinor sat down beside him, throwing her hat on the ground.\r\n\r\n“Whither away?” Vic asked.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll tell you presently. I want to get over my stage fright first.”\r\n\r\n“All right, look at this view. I\u0027ll give it to you if you like it.”\r\n Vic had turned to the west again and was looking away toward the dreamy\r\nprairies beyond the valley.\r\n\r\nElinor recalled the September day when the bull snake lay sunning itself\r\non this very stone. How shy and awkward he seemed then, with only a deep\r\nsweet voice to attract favorable attention. And now, big, and graceful,\r\nand handsome, and reserved--any girl might be proud to have his regard.\r\nOf course, for herself, there was Vincent Burgess in the pleasant\r\ninevitable sometime. She gave little thought to that. She was living in\r\nthe present. And in the wooing spirit of the April afternoon Elinor was\r\nglad to sit here beside Victor Burleigh.\r\n\r\n“What time next month do we have the big baseball game?” she asked. “The\r\ngame that is to make Sunrise the champion college in Kansas, and you our\r\ncollege champion?” Vic\u0027s lips suddenly grew gray.\r\n\r\n“Friday, the thirteenth--auspicious date!” he answered. “But I may not\r\nplay in it. I might fail.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we must win this game, anyhow, and you never do fail. Don\u0027t forget\r\nthe name your mother gave you. Do you remember when you told me that?”\r\n\r\n“A couple of thousand years ago, wasn\u0027t it?” Vic asked, smiling down\r\non her. “If I don\u0027t play Sunrise needn\u0027t fail, even for Friday, the\r\nthirteenth.”\r\n\r\n“But it will fail without you. You pulled us to victory a year ago\r\nat the Thanksgiving game, and last fall the Sunrise goal line wasn\u0027t\r\ncrossed the whole season with \u0027Burleigh! Burly! Burlee!\u0027 for a slogan.\r\nWe must win this year. Then it will be a complete championship:\r\nfootball, basket-ball, and baseball. We won\u0027t do it though unless we\r\nhave \u0027Burleigh at the bat\u0027.”\r\n\r\nA shadow crossed his face and he looked away to where a tiny film of\r\nblue smoke was rising above the rough ledges beyond the river.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m getting over my stage fright now,” Elinor said, the pink deepening\r\non her fair cheek, “and I\u0027ll tell you what I want.”\r\n\r\n“Command me!” he said, gallantly.\r\n\r\n“Well, it\u0027s awful, and the girls are too mean to live. But they are\r\ngetting even with me, they say, for something I did last fall.”\r\n\r\n“All right.” Vic was waiting, graciously.\r\n\r\n“A lot of us have broken some of the rules of the Sorority and it\u0027s\r\ndecreed that I must go over the route we came home by on the night of\r\nthe storm down in the Kickapoo Corral. They are having a \u0027spread\u0027 down\r\nthere at five o\u0027clock and we are to get there in time for it, going\r\nby the west side of the river, and they\u0027ll bring us home. They said I\r\nshould ask you to go with me, and if you would n\u0027t go for me to ask Mr.\r\nTrench to go. They are too silly for anything.”\r\n\r\n“Trench was executed for manslaughter at two forty-five today. It\u0027s\r\nthree o\u0027clock now. Let\u0027s go.” He lifted her to her feet and stooped to\r\npick up her hat.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mind going with me, Victor?” Elinor asked.\r\n\r\n“Do I mind? I\u0027ve been waiting two years for you to ask me to go.” His\r\nvoice was very deep and there was a soft light in his brown eyes.\r\n\r\nElinor\u0027s pulse beat felt a thrill. A sudden sense of the sweetness of\r\nthe day and of a joy unlike any other joy of her life possessed her.\r\n\r\nDown on the bridge they stopped to watch the sunlit waters of the Walnut\r\nrippling below them.\r\n\r\n“Are we the same two who crept up on this bridge, wet, and muddy and\r\ntired, and scared one stormy October night eighteen months ago?” Elinor\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve had no reincarnation that I know of,” Vic replied.\r\n\r\n“I have,” Elinor declared, and Vic thought of Burgess.\r\n\r\nUp the narrow hidden glen they made their way, clambering about broken\r\nledges, crossing and recrossing the little stream, hugging the dry\r\nfooting under overhanging rock shelves, laughing at missteps and\r\nrejoicing in the springtime joy, until they came suddenly upon a grassy\r\nopen space, cliff-walled and hidden, even from the rest of the glen.\r\nAt the farther end was the low doorway-like entrance to the cave. The\r\nsong-birds were twittering in the trees above them, the waters of the\r\nlittle stream gurgled at their feet, the woodsy odor of growing things\r\nwas in the air, and all the little glen was restful and quiet.\r\n\r\n“Isn\u0027t it beautiful and romantic--and everything nice?” Elinor cried.\r\n“I don\u0027t mind this sentence to hard service. It is worth it. Do you mind\r\nthe loss of time, Victor?”\r\n\r\n“I counted it gain to be here with you, even in the storm and terror.\r\nHow can this be loss?” he answered her. His voice was low and musical.\r\n\r\nElinor looked up quickly. And quickly as the thing had come to Victor\r\nBurleigh on the west bluff above the old Kickapoo Corral two Octobers\r\nago, so to Elinor Wream came the vision of what the love of such a man\r\nwould be to the woman who could win it.\r\n\r\n“Do you really mean it, Victor? Was n\u0027t I a lump of lead? A dead weight\r\nto your strength that night? You have never once spoken of it.”\r\n\r\nShe looked up with shining eyes and put out her hand. What could he do\r\nbut keep it in his own for a moment, firm-held, as something he would\r\nkeep forever.\r\n\r\n“I have never once forgotten it,” he murmured.\r\n\r\nThe cave by daylight was as the lightning had shown it, a big chamber,\r\nrock-walled, rock-floored, rock-roofed, in the side of the bluff, but\r\nlittle below the level of the ground and easy of entrance. It was cool\r\nand damp, but, with the daylight through the doorway, it was merely\r\nshadowy inside. In the farther wall yawned the ragged opening to the\r\nblack spaces leading off underground. Through this opening these two\r\nhad crept once, feeling that behind the wall somebody was crouching\r\nwith evil intent. They peered through the opening now, trying to see the\r\nmiraculous way by which they had come into the cave from the rear.\r\nBut they stared only into blackness and caught the breath of the damp\r\nunderground air with a faint odor of wood smoke somewhere.\r\n\r\n“Elinor, it\u0027s a good thing we came through here in the night. It would\r\nhave been maddening to be forced in here by daylight. We must have\r\nslipped down through a hole somewhere in our stumbles and hit a passage\r\nleading out of here only to the river, a sort of fire escape by way of\r\nthe waters. You remember we couldn\u0027t get anywhere on the back track,\r\nexcept to the cliff above the Walnut. It\u0027s all very fine if the escaper\r\ngets out of the river before he reaches Lagonda\u0027s whirlpool.”\r\n\r\nHe was leaning far through the opening in the wall, gazing into the\r\ndarkness and seeing nothing.\r\n\r\n“Somewhere back in there, while I was pawing around that night, I found\r\nsomething up in a chink that felt like the odd-shaped little silver\r\npitcher my mother had once--an old family heirloom, lost or stolen some\r\ntime ago. I came back and hunted for it later, but it was winter time\r\nand cold as the grave outside and darker in here, and I couldn\u0027t find\r\nanything, so I concluded maybe I was mistaken altogether about its being\r\nlike that old pitcher of ours. It was a bad night for \u0027seein\u0027 things\u0027;\r\nit might have been for \u0027feelin\u0027 things\u0027 as well. There\u0027s nothing here\r\nbut damp air and darkness.”\r\n\r\nAnd even while he was speaking close beside the wall, so near that a\r\nhand could have reached him, a man was crouching; the same man whose\r\ncruel eyes had stared through the bushes at Lloyd Fenneben as he sat by\r\nthe river before Pigeon Place; the same man whose eyes had leered at Vic\r\nBurleigh in this same place eighteen months before; the same man whom\r\nlittle Bug Buler\u0027s innocent face had startled as he was about to seize\r\nthe money box at the gateway to the Sunrise football field; and this\r\nsame man was crouching now to spring at Vic Burleigh\u0027s throat in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s a good thing a fellow has a guardian angel once in a while,” Vic\r\nsaid, as he hastily withdrew his head and shoulders. “We get pretty\r\nclose to the edge of things sometimes and never know how near we are to\r\ndestruction.”\r\n\r\n“We were pretty close that night,” Elinor replied.\r\n\r\n“Shall we rest here a little while, or do your savage sorority sisters\r\nrequire you to do time in so many minutes?” Vic asked, as they left\r\nthe cave and came again into the sunlight, and all the sweetness of the\r\nApril woodland, and the rugged beauty of the glen.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m glad to rest,” Elinor said, dropping down on a stone. Her cheeks\r\nwere blooming from the exercise of the tramp, and her pretty hair was in\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nFar away from the west prairie came the faint note of a child\u0027s voice in\r\nsong.\r\n\r\n“Victor,” Elinor said, as they listened, “do you know that the Sunrise\r\ngirls envy Bug Buler? They say you would have more time for the girls\r\nif it wasn\u0027t for him. What you spend for him you could spend on light\r\nrefreshments for them, don\u0027t you see?”\r\n\r\n“I know I\u0027m a stingy cuss,” Vic said, carelessly, but a deeper red\r\ntouched his cheek.\r\n\r\n“You know you are not,” Elinor insisted, “and I\u0027ve always thought it\r\nwas a beautiful thing for a big grown man like you to care for a little\r\norphan boy. All the girls think so, too.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh looked down at her gratefully.\r\n\r\n“I thought once--in fact, I was told once--that my care for him was\r\nsufficient reason why I should let all the girls alone, most of all why\r\nI should not think of Elinor Wream.”\r\n\r\n“How strange!” Elinor\u0027s face had a womanly expression. “I\u0027ve never had\r\na little child to love me. I\u0027ve been brought up with only AEneas\u0027s\r\nsmall son Ascanius, and other classical children, on Uncle Joshua\u0027s Dead\r\nLanguage book shelves. I feel sometimes as if I\u0027d been robbed.”\r\n\r\n“You? I didn\u0027t know you had ever wanted anything you did n\u0027t get.”\r\n\r\nVictor had thought all things were due to her and came as duly. The\r\nwomanly look on her face now was a revelation to him. But then he had\r\nnot dared to study her face for months, and he did not yet realize what\r\nlife in Dr. Fenneben\u0027s home must mean to her character-building.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll tell you some time about something I ought to have had, a\r\nsacrifice I was forced to make; but not now, Tell me about Bug.”\r\n\r\nThere was no bitterness in Elinor\u0027s tone, yet the idea of her having the\r\ncapacity to endure gave her a newer charm to the man beside her.\r\n\r\n“I have never known whose child Bug is,” he began. “The way in which\r\nhe came to me is full of terrible memories, and it all happened on\r\nthe blackest day of my life--the hard life of a lonely boy on a Kansas\r\nclaim. That\u0027s why I never speak of it and try always to forget it. I\r\nfound him by mere accident, helpless and in awful danger. He was about\r\ntwo years old then and all he could say was \u0027bad man\u0027 and his name, \u0027Bug\r\nBuler.\u0027 I\u0027ve wondered if Bug is his name, or if he could not speak his\r\nreal name plainly then.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh paused, and a sense of Elinor\u0027s interest brought a thrill of\r\njoy to him.\r\n\r\n“Where was he?” she asked.\r\n\r\nVic slowly unfastened his cuff and slipped his coat sleeve up to his\r\nelbow.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that scar?” he asked. “It is not the only one I have.\r\nI fought with death for that baby boy and I shall always carry the scars\r\nof that day. Bug was alone in a lonely little deserted dugout. Somebody\r\nhad left him there to perish. He was on a low chair, the only furniture\r\nin the room, and on the earth floor between him and me were five of the\r\nugliest rattlesnakes that ever coiled for a deadly blow. Little Bug held\r\nout his arms to me, and I\u0027ll never forget his baby face--and--I killed\r\nthem all and carried him away. It was a dangerous, hard job, but the boy\r\nI saved has been the blessing of my life ever since. I could not have\r\nendured the days that followed without his need for care and his love\r\nand innocence. He\u0027s kept me good, Elinor. When I got back home with\r\nhim my mother, who had been very sick, was dead, and our house had been\r\nrobbed of every valuable by some thief--a wayside tragedy of western\r\nKansas. That was the day the pitcher was stolen. A note was left warning\r\nme not to follow nor try to find out who had done the stealing, but I\r\nthought I knew anyhow. That\u0027s why I killed that bull snake the first day\r\nI came to Sunrise and that\u0027s why I must have looked like a bulldog to\r\nyou, soft-sheltered Cambridge folks. Life has been mostly a fist fight\r\nfor me, but Dr. Fenneben has taught me that there are other powers\r\nbeside physical strength. That the knock-down game doesn\u0027t bring the\r\nreal victory always. I hope I\u0027ve learned a little here.”\r\n\r\nA little! Could this be the big awkward freshman of a September day gone\r\nby? Then college culture is surely worth the cost.\r\n\r\nElinor leaned forward, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about your father,” she said.\r\n\r\n“My father lost his life because he dared to tell the truth,” Victor\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n“Oh, glorious!” Elinor cried, earnestly.\r\n\r\n“I have always loved my father\u0027s memory for his courage,” Victor\r\ncontinued. “He was a believer in law enforcement and he was a terror\r\nto the bootleggers who carried whisky into our settlement. A man named\r\nGresh was notorious for selling whisky to the claim holders. He gave it,\r\nElinor, gave it, to a boy, a widow\u0027s son, made him drunk, robbed him,\r\nand left him to freeze to death in a blizzard. The boy lived long enough\r\nto tell my father who did it, and it was his testimony that helped to\r\nconvict Gresh and start him to the penitentiary. He escaped from the\r\nsheriff on the way--and, so far as I know, there\u0027s one bad man still at\r\nlarge, a fugitive before the law. Whisky is the devil\u0027s own best tool,\r\nwhether a man drinks it himself or gets other people to drink it.”\r\n\r\n“That\u0027s a bad name,” Elinor said. “My grandfather adopted a boy named\r\nGresh, who turned out bad. I think he was killed in a saloon row in\r\nChicago. Did this Gresh ever trouble you again?”\r\n\r\nBurleigh\u0027s face was grim as he answered:\r\n\r\n“My father was waylaid and murdered with a club by this man. He escaped\r\nafterward into Indian Territory. He left his own name, Gresh, scrawled\r\non a piece of paper pinned to my father\u0027s coat to show whose revenge\r\nwas worked out. He was a volcano of human hate--that man Gresh. After\r\nmy father\u0027s name was written--\u0027The same club for every Burleigh who ever\r\ncrosses my path.\u0027 I expect to cross his path some day, and if I ever lay\r\nmy eyes on that fiend it will go hard with one of us.” The yellow\r\nglow burned again in Victor Burleigh\u0027s eyes and his fists clinched\r\ninvoluntarily. They were silent a while, until the sweetness of the\r\nday and the joy of being together wooed them to happier thoughts. Then\r\nElinor remembered her disordered hair and, throwing aside her hat, she\r\ndeftly put it into place.\r\n\r\n“Am I presentable for the supper at the Kickapoo Corral?” she asked, as\r\nshe picked up her hat again.\r\n\r\n“You suit me,” Burleigh replied. “What are the Kickapoo requirements?”\r\n\r\n“That Victor Burleigh shall be satisfied,” she answered, roguishly.\r\n“Really, that\u0027s right. Four girls offered to substitute for me in this\r\npenitential pilgrimage and write some long translations for me beside.”\r\n\r\n“Four, individually or collectively?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Either way,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Why did n\u0027t you let them do it?\r\n\r\n“Which way?”\r\n\r\n“Either way,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Would you rather have had the four either way, than me?” she\r\nquestioned, with pretty vanity.\r\n\r\n“Much rather.” His voice was stern.\r\n\r\n“Why?” She was stung by the answer.\r\n\r\nThe glen was all a dreamy gray-green ruggedness of shelving rock with\r\nmossy crevices and ferny nooks. The sunlight filtering through the\r\nyoung leaves fell about them in a shadow-flecked softness. There was a\r\ncrooning song of some bird on its nest, the murmur of waters rippling\r\ndown the stony shallows, and a beautiful girl in a dainty pink dress\r\nwith her fingers just touching her fluffy masses of hair.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\nWith the question Elinor looked up and saw why. Saw in Victor Burleigh\u0027s\r\ngolden-brown eyes a look she had never read in eyes before; saw the\r\nwhole face, the rugged, manly face lighted with a man\u0027s overmastering\r\nlove. And the joy of it thrilled her soul.\r\n\r\n“Do you know why?”\r\n\r\nHe leaned toward her ever so little. And Elinor Wream, forgetful of\r\nthe Wream family rank, forgetful of her tacit consent to Uncle Joshua\u0027s\r\nwishes, forgetful of Vincent Burgess and his heritage of culture,\r\nbeautiful Elinor Wream, with her starry eyes, and cheeks of\r\npeach-blossom pink, put out her hands to Victor Burleigh, who took them\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Let me hold them a minute,” he said, softly. “There are sixty years to\r\nremember, but only one hour like this.”\r\n\r\nThen, forgetful of the world and the demands of the world, keeping her\r\nhands in his, he bent and kissed her, as from the foundation of the\r\nworld it was his right to do. And Love\u0027s Young Dream, not bought\r\nwith pain, as mother love is bought, nor wrought out with prayer and\r\nsacrificial service, as love for all humanity is won, came again on this\r\nApril day to the little, rock-sheltered glen beside the bright waters\r\nof the Walnut, and briefly there rebuilt in rainbow hues the old, old\r\nparadise of joy for these two alone.\r\n\r\nAnd into the new Eden came the new serpent also for to destroy. Before\r\nElinor and Victor was the sunlit valley. Behind them was the cave\u0027s\r\nmouth with its shadowy gloom deepening back to dense darkness. And\r\ncreeping stealthily through that blackness, like a serpent warming its\r\nvenom and writhing slowly toward the light, a human form was slowly,\r\nstealthily crawling outward, with head upreared and cruel eyes alert.\r\nThe brutal face was void of pity, as if the conscience behind it had\r\nlong been bound and gagged to human sympathy.\r\n\r\nWhile Burleigh was speaking the caveman had reached the doorway and\r\nreared up just beside it in the shadow. Clutching a brutal-looking club\r\nin his hairy, rough hand, he stood listening to the story of the murder\r\nthat had left Victor fatherless. The face of the listener made clear the\r\nneed for guardian angels. One leap, one blow, and Victor Burleigh would\r\ncarry only one more scar to his grave.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a faint piping voice floated in upon the glen:\r\n\r\n Little childwen pwessing near\r\n     To the feet of Thwist, the Ting,\r\n Have you neiver doubt nor fear\r\n     Or some twibute do you bwing?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Bug Buler, flushed and splashed, and generally muddy and happy, came\r\naround the fallen ledges and debauched into the grassy sunshiny space\r\nbefore the cavern. Only a tiny, tumbled-up, joyous child, with no power\r\nin his pudgy little arm; and Victor Burleigh, tall, muscular and agile.\r\nAgainst this man of tremendous strength the caveman\u0027s club was lifted.\r\nBut with the sound of the child\u0027s voice and the sight of the innocent\r\nface the club fell harmless. A look of fright, deepening to a maniac\u0027s\r\nterror, seized the creature, and noiselessly and swiftly as a serpent\r\nwould escape he crawled back into the darkness and burrowed deep from\r\nthe eyes of men. So strength that day was ruled by weakness.\r\n\r\n“I ist followed you, Vic,” Bug said, clutching Vic\u0027s hand.\r\n\r\n“This is n\u0027t a safe place to come, Bug. You must n\u0027t follow me here.”\r\n\r\n“Nen you must n\u0027t go into is n\u0027t safe places, so I won\u0027t follow. Little\r\nfolks don\u0027t know,” Bug said, with cunning gravity.\r\n\r\n“He is right,” Elinor said. “I think we\u0027d better leave now.”\r\n\r\nThey knew that henceforth this spot would be holy ground for them, but\r\nthey did not dare to think further than that. They only wished that the\r\nmoments would stay, that the sun would loiter slowly down the afternoon\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n“I know a way out,” Bug declared. Turn, “I\u0027ll show you.”\r\n\r\nThen, with a child\u0027s sense of direction, he led away from the cave out\r\nto where the deep ravine headed in a rough mass of broken rock.\r\n\r\n“Tlimb up that and you\u0027re out,” Bug declared.\r\n\r\nThey climbed up to the high level prairie that sweeps westward from the\r\nWalnut bluffs.\r\n\r\n“Doodby, folks. I want to Botany wiv urn over there. I turn wiv Limpy\r\nout here.”\r\n\r\nBug pointed to a group of students wandering about in search of dogtooth\r\nviolets and other botanical plunder from Nature\u0027s springtime treasury.\r\nAmong the group was Bug\u0027s chum, the crippled student.\r\n\r\n“Well, stay with them this time, you little wandering Jew,” Vic\r\nadmonished, nor dreamed how his guardian angel had come to him this day\r\nin the guise of this same little wanderer.\r\n\r\nWhen Victor and Elinor had come at last to the west bluff above the\r\nWalnut River, the late afternoon was already casting long shadows across\r\nthe grassy level of the old Kickapoo Corral. And again the camp fires\r\nwere glowing where a Sorority “spread” was merrily in the making.\r\n\r\nThey must go down soon and join in the hilarity. But a golden half hour\r\nyet hung in the west--and the going down meant the going back to all\r\nthat had been.\r\n\r\n“Look at the foam on the whirlpool, Elinor. See how deliberately it\r\nswings upstream. Isn\u0027t that a most deceiving bit of treachery?” Vic said\r\nas he watched the river.\r\n\r\nElinor looked thoughtfully at the slow-moving water.\r\n\r\n“I cannot endure deceit,” she said at last. “I like honesty in\r\neverything. I said I would tell you sometime about a sacrifice I was\r\nforced to make. I\u0027ll tell you now if you will not speak of what I say.”\r\n\r\nHow delicious to have her confidence in anything. Vic smiled assent.\r\n\r\n“My father had a fortune from my mother. When he died he left me to\r\nthe care of my two uncles, and gave all his money to endow chairs in\r\nuniversities. He thought a woman could marry money, and that he was\r\ndoing mankind a service in this endowment. Maybe he was, but I\u0027ve always\r\nrebelled against being dependent. I\u0027ve always wanted my own. Uncle\r\nJoshua thinks I am frivolous, and he has told Uncle Lloyd that it\u0027s just\r\nmy love of spending and extravagant notions that makes me rebel against\r\nconditions. It is n\u0027t. It\u0027s the sense of being robbed, as it were. It\r\nwas n\u0027t right and honest toward me, even in a great cause, to leave\r\nme dependent. Uncle Lloyd would never have done it. I hope he does n\u0027t\r\nthink I\u0027m as bad as Uncle Joshua does. You won\u0027t mind my telling you\r\nthis, nor think me ungrateful to my relatives for their care of me.\r\nNobody quite understands me but you.”\r\n\r\nThe time had come for them to join the jolly picnic crowd in the\r\nCorral. She would go back to Vincent Burgess in a little while, and this\r\nglorious day would be only a memory. And yet, down in the pretty glen,\r\nVictor had held her hands and kissed her red lips. And she had been\r\nglad down there. The void in his life seemed blacker than the blackness\r\nbehind the cavern.\r\n\r\n“Elinor,” he asked, suddenly, “are you bound by any promise--has\r\nProfessor Burgess--?” He hesitated.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered, turning her face away.\r\n\r\n“Pardon my rudeness. You know I am not well-bred,” he said, gently.\r\n\r\n“Victor Burleigh, you ill-bred, of all the gentle, manly fellows in\r\nSunrise! You know you are not.”\r\n\r\nA great hope leaped to life now, as Vic recalled the query, “If Victor\r\nBurleigh had his corners knocked off and was sandpapered down and\r\nhad money?”--and of Elinor\u0027s blushing confession that it would make a\r\ndifference she could not help if these things were. The corners were\r\nknocked off now, and Dean Fenneben had gently but persistently applied\r\nthe sandpaper. The money must be henceforth the one condition.\r\n\r\n“Elinor.” Vic\u0027s voice was sweet as low bars of music.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Victor, there\u0027s something I can\u0027t prevent.”\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of Uncle Joshua, whose money had supported her all\r\nthese years and of her obligation to heed his wishes. It was all settled\r\nfor her now. And all the while Victor was thinking of his own limited\r\nmeans as the rock that was wrecking him with her.\r\n\r\nFor all his life afterward he never forgot the sorrow of that moment. He\r\nlooked into Elinor\u0027s face, and all the longing, all the heart-hunger\r\nof the days gone by, and of the days to come seemed to lie in those\r\nwide-open eyes shaded by long black lashes.\r\n\r\n“Elinor, my father\u0027s cruel murder and my mother dying alone were one\r\nkind of grief. My fight with those deadly poison things to rescue little\r\nBug was another kind. My days of hardship and poverty on the claim, with\r\nonly Bug and me in that desolate loneliness, was still another. But none\r\nof these seem a sorrow beside what I must face henceforth. And yet I\r\nhave one joy mine now. You did care down in the glen. May I keep that\r\none gracious joy--mine always?”\r\n\r\n“You have always won in every game. You will in this struggle. Don\u0027t\r\nforget the name your mother gave you.” Her eyes were luminous with\r\ntears. “We must go down to the Corral now. Tomorrow will make things all\r\nright. I shall be proud of you and your success everywhere, for you will\r\nsucceed.”\r\n\r\n“I may not be worthy of victory,” he said, sadly.\r\n\r\n“You have never been unworthy. Don\u0027t be now.” She smiled bravely.\r\n\r\nThey turned from the west prairie and the sunset, and slowly they passed\r\nout of its passing radiance down to the darkening spaces of the old\r\nKickapoo Corral.\r\n\r\nAnd the day with its gladness and sorrow, whether for loss or gain,\r\nslipped into the shadowy beauty of an April twilight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. GAIN, OR LOSS?\r\n\r\n _Ye know how hard an Idol dies, an\u0027 what that meant\r\n     to me--E\u0027en take it for a sacrifice, acceptable to Thee_.\r\n                              --KIPLING\r\nTHE ball game on Friday, the thirteenth, was a great event this year.\r\nThe Sunrise football eleven had held the championship record with an\r\nuncrossed goal line in the autumn. The basket-ball team had had no\r\ndefeat this year. Debating tests had given Sunrise the victory. That\r\ncame through Trench and the crippled student. And the state oratorical\r\nstruggle repeated the story, a conquest, all the greater because Victor\r\nBurleigh, the athlete, wore also the laurels of oratory. And why should\r\nhe not, with that fine presence and magnificent voice? As Dr. Fenneben\r\nlistened to his forceful logic he saw clearly the line for the boy\u0027s\r\nfuture, a line, he thought, that could end at last only in the pulpit.\r\n\r\nOne more battle to fight now and Lagonda Ledge and the whole Walnut\r\nValley would go down in history as famous soil. It was a banner year for\r\nSunrise, and enthusiasm was at fever pitch, which in college is the only\r\nhealthy temperature. In this last battle Sunrise turned again to Victor\r\nBurleigh as its highest hope. Although this was his first game for the\r\nseason, he had never failed to bring victory to the Sunrise banners, and\r\nin all his base-ball practice he was as unerring as he was speedy. And\r\nthen success was his habit anyhow. So “Burleigh at the bat” was the\r\nslogan now from the summit of the college ridge to the farthest corners\r\nof Lagonda Ledge; and idol worship were insignificant compared to the\r\nadulation poured out on him. And Burleigh, being young and very human,\r\nhad all the pleasure the adoration of a community can bring to its local\r\nhero. For truly, few triumphs in life\u0027s later years can be fraught with\r\nhalf the keen joy these school day victories bring. And the applause of\r\nlistening senates means less than good old comrades\u0027 yells.\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess, A.B., Greek Professor from Boston, seemed to have\r\nforgotten entirely about types and geographical breadths and seclusion\r\nfor profound research amid barren prairies. He was faculty member on the\r\nAthletic board now and enthusiastic about all college sports. Sunrise\r\nhad done this much for him anyhow. In addition, the young educator was\r\ntaking on a little roundness, suggestive of a stout form in middle life.\r\n\r\nBut Vincent Burgess had not forgotten all of the motives that had\r\npulled him Kansas-ward, although unknown to Dr. Fenneben, he had already\r\nrefused to consider a position higher up in an eastern college. He was\r\nnot quite ready to leave the West yet. Of course, not. Elinor Wream was\r\nonly half through school and growing more popular as she was growing\r\nmore womanly and more beautiful each year. His salvation lay in keeping\r\non the grounds if he would hold his claim undisturbed.\r\n\r\nBurgess had come to Kansas, he had told Fenneben, in order to know\r\nsomething of the state where his only sister had lived. He did not know\r\nyet all he wished to know about her life and death here. Her name was\r\nnever spoken in his father\u0027s presence after she came West, so great was\r\nthat father\u0027s anger over her leaving the East. And deep in Vincent\u0027s\r\nmind he fixed the impression that his daughter had died as unreconciled\r\nto her brother as to her father himself.\r\n\r\nThis was all his own business, however, and hidden deep, almost out of\r\nsight of himself, was a selfish motive that had not yet put a visible\r\nmark on the surface.\r\n\r\nBurgess wanted to marry Norrie Wream, and he wanted her to have all the\r\ngood things of life which in her simple rearing had been denied her.\r\nThe heritage from his father\u0027s estate included certain trust funds\r\nambiguously bestowed by an eccentric English ancestor upon someone who\r\nhad come West not long before his death. These funds Vincent held by his\r\nfather\u0027s will--to which will Joshua Wream was witness--on condition that\r\nno heir to these funds was living. If there were such person or persons\r\nliving--but Burgess knew there were none. Joshua Wream had made sure of\r\nthat for him before he left Cambridge. And yet it might be well to\r\nstay in Kansas for a year or two--much better to settle any possible\r\ndifficulty here than to have anything follow him East later. For Burgess\r\nhad his eye on Dr. Wream\u0027s chair in Harvard when the old man should\r\ngive it up. That was a part of the contract between the two men, the old\r\ndoctor and the young professor. Until the night when Bond Saxon forced\r\nhim to take an unwilling oath, Burgess had had a comfortable conscience,\r\nsure that his financial future was settled, and confident that this\r\nassured him the hand of Elinor Wream when the time was ripe. With that\r\nOctober night, however, a weight of anxiety began that increased with\r\nthe passing days. For as he grew nearer to the student life and took on\r\nflesh and good will and a broader knowledge of the worth of humanity, so\r\nhe grew nearer to this smoothly hidden inner care. And, outside and in,\r\nhe wanted to stay in Kansas for the time.\r\n\r\nIn the weeks before the big ball game, Victor Burleigh seemed to have\r\nforgotten the glen and the west bluff above the Kickapoo Corral. The\r\ngirls who would have substituted for Elinor in the afternoon ramble took\r\nup much of the big sophomore\u0027s time, and he never seemed more gay nor\r\ncare free. And Elinor, if she had a heartache, did not show it in her\r\nhappy manner.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon before the ball game, a May thunderstorm swept the\r\nWalnut Valley and the darkness fell early. As Dennie Saxon waited on\r\nthe Sunrise portico before starting out in the rain, Professor Burgess\r\nlocked the front door and joined her. Victor Burleigh was also waiting\r\nbeside a stone column for the shower to lighten. Burgess did not see\r\nhim in the darkening twilight and Burleigh never spoke to the young\r\ninstructor when it was not necessary.\r\n\r\n“I must be nervous,” Professor Burgess said, trying to manage Dennie\u0027s\r\numbrella and catching it in her hair. “I had a letter today that worried\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Too bad!” Dennie said sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll tell you all about it sometime.”\r\n\r\nHe was trying to loose the wire rib-joint from Dennie\u0027s hair, which\r\nthe dampness was rolling in soft little ringlets about her forehead and\r\nneck. Half-consciously, he remembered the same outline of rippling\r\nhair, as it had looked in the glow of the October camp fire down in the\r\nKickapoo Corral when she was telling the old legend of Swift Elk and The\r\nFawn of the Morning Light. She smiled up at him consolingly. Dennie was\r\nlevel-headed, and life was always worth living where she was.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll be your rain beau.” He took her arm to assist her down the steps.\r\n\r\nSo courteous was his action, she might have been a lady of rank instead\r\nof old Bond Saxon\u0027s daughter carrying her own weight of a sorrow greater\r\nthan Lagonda Ledge dreamed of. As the two walked slowly homeward under\r\nthe dripping shelter of the trees, Vincent Burgess felt a sense of\r\ncomfort and pleasure out of all keeping for a man in love elsewhere.\r\nVictor Burleigh watched them from the shadow of the portico column.\r\n\r\n“I believe Trench is right. He insists that Burgess likes Dennie, or\r\nthat he is mean enough to deceive Dennie into liking him. A man like\r\nthat ought to be killed--a scholar, and a rich man, and Dennie such a\r\nbrave little poor girl with a kind, weak-kneed, old father on her heart.\r\nNorrie ought to know this, but who am I to say a word?”\r\n\r\n“Victor Burleigh, won\u0027t you release the fair princess from the tower?” a\r\ngirl\u0027s voice called.\r\n\r\nVic turned to see Elinor framed in the half-way window of the south\r\nturret. And in that dripping shadowy light, no frame could want a rarer\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve fallen into the pit and am far on the road to perdition,” Elinor\r\nsaid. “I hurried down this way from choir practice and Uncle Lloyd\u0027s\r\ngone and left the lower door locked. It thundered so, and Dennie didn\u0027t\r\ncome into the study, and nobody heard my screams. But if I perish, I\r\nperish,” she added with mock resignation.\r\n\r\n“If you\u0027ll let up on perishing for half a minute, Rapunzel, I\u0027ll to\r\nthe rescue,” Vic cried, “if I have to climb the dome and knock the _per\r\naspera_ out of the State Seal and come down through the hole, _per astra\r\nad aspera_.” And then he rushed off to find an unlocked exit to the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nFrom the Chapel end of the circular stairs, he called presently.\r\n\r\n“Curfew must not ring for a couple of seconds. Rise to the surface, fair\r\nmermaid.”\r\n\r\nElinor came up the winding stair into the dimly lighted chapel at his\r\ncall. The two had avoided each other since the April day in the glen.\r\nThey were not to blame for this chance meeting now.\r\n\r\n“When you are in trouble and the nights are dark and rainy, call me,\r\nElinor,” Vic said as they were crossing the rotunda.\r\n\r\n“If I show you sometimes how to look up and find the light, as you\r\nshowed me the Sunrise beacon on the night of the storm out on West\r\nBluff, you may be glad you heard me. See that glow on the dome! You\r\nwould have missed that down in Lagonda Ledge.”\r\n\r\nA level ray from a momentary cloudrift in the western sky smote the\r\nstained glass of the dome, lighting its gleaming inscription with a\r\nfleeting radiance.\r\n\r\n“But the light comes rarely and is so far away, and between times, only\r\nthe cave, and the dark ways behind it leading to the river,” he said\r\ngravely. The sorrow of hopelessness was his tone.\r\n\r\n“Not unless one chooses to burrow downward,” she replied softly. “Let\u0027s\r\nhurry home. Tomorrow you will be \u0027Victor the Famous\u0027 again. I hope this\r\nshower won\u0027t spoil the ball game.”\r\n\r\nAs night deepened, the rain fell steadily. Up in Victor Burleigh\u0027s room\r\nBug Buler grew drowsy early.\r\n\r\n“I want to say my pwayers now, Vic,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe big fellow put down his book and took the child in his arms. Bug\r\nhad a genius for praying briefly and for others rather than for himself.\r\nTonight he merely clasped his chubby hands and said, reverently:\r\n\r\n“Dear Dod, please ist make Vic dood as folks finks he is, for Thwist\u0027s\r\nsake. Amen-n-n.”\r\n\r\nWhen he fell asleep, Victor sat a long while staring at the window where\r\nthe May rain was beating heavily. At length, he bent over little Bug and\r\npushed back the curls from his brow. Bug smiled up drowsily and went on\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\n“As good as folks think I am, Bug!” he mused. “You have gotten between\r\nme and the rattlesnakes that were after my soul a good many times,\r\nlittle brother-of-mine. As good as folks think I am! Do you know what it\r\ncosts to be that good?”\r\n\r\nTen minutes later he sat in Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s library.\r\n\r\n“I have come for help,” he said in reply to the Dean\u0027s questioning face.\r\n\r\n“I hope I can give it,” Fenneben responded.\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s about tomorrow\u0027s game. There are sure to be some professional\r\nplayers on the other team. I want Sunrise to win. I want to win myself.”\r\n Vic\u0027s voice was harsh tonight. And the Dean caught the hard tone.\r\n\r\n“I want Sunrise to win. I want you to win. There will probably be some\r\nprofessionals to play against, but we have no way of proving this,”\r\n Fenneben said.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of such playing, Doctor?” Vic asked.\r\n\r\n“I think the rule about professionalism is often a strained piece of\r\nfoolishness. It is violated persistently and persistently winked at, but\r\nso long as it is the rule there is only one square thing to do, and that\r\nis to live up to the law. You should not dread any professionalism in\r\nthe game tomorrow, however. You\u0027ll bring us through anyhow, and keep the\r\nSunrise name and fame untarnished.” The Dean smiled genially.\r\n\r\nBurleigh\u0027s face was very pale and a strange fire burned in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Fenneben”--his musical voice rang clear--“I\u0027m only a poor devil\r\nfrom the short-grass country where life each year depends on that year\u0027s\r\ncrop. Three years out of four, the wind and drouth bring only failure\r\nat harvest time. Then we starve our bodies and grip onto hope and\r\ndetermination with our souls till seedtime comes again. I want a college\r\neducation. Last summer burned us out as usual within a month of harvest.\r\nThen the mortgage got in its work on my claim and I had to give it up.\r\nI had barely enough to get through here at pauper rates this year--but\r\nI could n\u0027t do it and keep Bug, too. I went into Colorado and played\r\nbaseball for pay, so I could come here and bring him with me. That\u0027s why\r\nI can out-bat our team, and could win dead easy for Sunrise tomorrow.\r\nNobody in Kansas knows it. Now, what shall I do?”\r\n\r\nThe words were shot out like bullets.\r\n\r\n“What shall you do?” Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s black eyes held Burleigh. “There\r\nis only one thing to do. When you ranked high in grades with only the\r\ntrivial matter of excusable absence against you--no broken law--you took\r\nProfessor Burgess gently by the throat and told him you meant to play\r\nanyhow. You stood your ground like a man, for your own sake and for the\r\nhonor of Sunrise. Stand like a man for your own sake and the honor of\r\nSunrise, now. Go to Professor Burgess and take him gently--by the hand,\r\nthis time--and tell him you do not mean to play, and why you cannot.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh sat still as stone, his face white as marble, his wide-open\r\neyes under his black brows seeing nothing.\r\n\r\n“But our proud record--the glorious honor of this college,” he said at\r\nlength, and back of his words was the thought of Victor Burleigh, the\r\nidol of Sunrise, dethroned, where he had been adored.\r\n\r\n“There is no honor for a college like the honesty of its students. There\r\nis no prouder record than the record of daring to do the right. You\r\ncould get into the game once by a brute\u0027s strength. Get out of it now by\r\na gentleman\u0027s honor.”\r\n\r\nBehind the speech was Lloyd Fenneben himself, sympathetic, firm,\r\nupright, before whom the harshness of Victor Burleigh\u0027s face slowly gave\r\nplace to an expression of sorrow.\r\n\r\n“My boy,” Fenneben said gently, “Nature gave us the Walnut Valley with\r\nits limestone ledges and fine forest trees. But before our Sunrise could\r\nbe builded the ledge had to be shapen into the hewn stone, the green\r\ntree to the seasoned lumber, quarter-sawed oak--quarter-sawed, mind you.\r\nMill, forge and try-pit, ax and saw and chisel, with cleft and blow\r\nand furnace heat, shaped them all for Service. Over our doorway is\r\nthe Sunrise initial. It stands also for Strife, part of which you know\r\nalready; but it stands for Sacrifice as well. You are in the shaping.\r\nGod grant you may be turned out a man fitted by Sacrifice for Service\r\nwhen the shaping is done.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh rose, silent still, and the two went out together. At the\r\ndoorway, he turned to Fenneben, who grasped his hand without a word. And\r\nonce again, the firm hand clasp of the Dean of Sunrise seemed to bind\r\nthe country boy to the finer things of life. It had done the same on\r\nthat day after the Thanksgiving game when he sat in Fenneben\u0027s study,\r\nand understood for the first time what gives the right to pride in\r\nbrawny arm and steel-spring nerve.\r\n\r\nAfter Burleigh left him, Lloyd Fenneben stood for a long time on his\r\nveranda in the light of the doorway watching the steady downpour of the\r\nwarm May rain. As he turned at length to enter the house a rough-looking\r\nman with rain-soaked clothing and slouched hat, sprang out of the\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” he called hastily. “There\u0027s a little child fell in the river\r\nround the bend, and his mother got hold of him, but she can\u0027t pull him\r\nout, and can\u0027t hold on much longer. Will you come help me, quick? I\u0027ve\r\nonly got one arm or I would n\u0027t have had to ask for help.”\r\n\r\nAn empty sleeve was flapping in the rain, and Fenneben did not notice\r\nthen that the man kept that side of himself all the time in the shadows.\r\nFenneben had only one thought as he hurried away in the darkness, to\r\nsave the woman and child. His companion said little, directing the\r\ncourse toward the bend in the river before the gateway of Pigeon Place.\r\nAs they pushed on with all speed through rain and mud, Fenneben was\r\nhardly conscious that Dennie Saxon\u0027s words about the lonely gray-haired\r\nhermit woman were recurring curiously to his mind.\r\n\r\n“If talking about Sunrise made her cry like that, maybe you might do\r\nsomething for her,” Dennie had said. He had never tried to do anything\r\nfor her. Somehow she seemed to be the woman who was in peril now, and\r\nhe was half-consciously blaming himself that he had never tried to help\r\nher, had not even thought of her for months. Women were not in his line,\r\nexcept the kindly impersonal interest he felt for all the Sunrise\r\ngirls, and his sense of responsibility for Norrie, and the memory of a\r\ngirl--oh, the hungry haunting memory!\r\n\r\nAll this in a semi-conscious fleetness swept across his mind, that was\r\nbent on reaching the river, and on that woman holding a drowning child.\r\nAt the bend in the river, the man halted suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Look out! There\u0027s a stone; don\u0027t stumble!” he said hoarsely, dodging\r\nback as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThen Fenneben was conscious of his own feet striking the slab of stone\r\nby the roadside, of a sudden shove from somebody behind him, a two-armed\r\nman it must have been, of stumbling blindly, trying to catch at the elm\r\ntree that stood there, of falling through the underbrush, headforemost,\r\ninto the river, even of striking the water. As he fell, he was very\r\nfaintly conscious of a sense of pity for Victor Burleigh fighting out a\r\nbattle with his own honor tonight, and then he must have heard a dog\u0027s\r\nfierce yelp, and a woman\u0027s scream. Somehow, it seemed to come through\r\ndistance of time, as out of past years, and not through length of\r\nspace--and then of a brutal laugh and an oath with the words:\r\n\r\n“Now for Josh Wream, and--”\r\n\r\nBut Fenneben\u0027s head had struck the stone ledge against which the Walnut\r\nripples at low tide, and for a long time he knew no more.\r\n\r\nIt was raining still when Victor Burleigh reached the Saxon House.\r\nAt the door he met Professor Burgess, who was just leaving. Strangely\r\nenough, the memory of their first meeting at the campus gate on a\r\nSeptember day flashed into the mind of each as they came face to face\r\nnow. They never spoke to each other except when it was necessary. And\r\nyet tonight, something made them greet each other courteously.\r\n\r\n“Professor, will you be kind enough to come up to my room a few\r\nminutes?” Burleigh asked, lifting his cap to his instructor with the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” Vincent Burgess said with equal grace.\r\n\r\nBug Buler had kicked off the bed covering and lay fast asleep on his\r\nlittle cot with his stubby arms bare, and his little fat hands, dimpled\r\nin each knuckle, thrown wide apart.\r\n\r\n“I saw a picture like this once for the sign of the cross,” Vic said as\r\nhe drew the covering over the little form. “Bug has been a cross to me\r\nsometimes, but he\u0027s oftener my salvation.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Burgess wondered again, why a boy like Burleigh should have\r\nbeen given a voice of such rare charm.\r\n\r\n“I will not keep you long,” Vic said, turning from Bug. “I cannot play\r\nin tomorrow\u0027s game, and be a man.”\r\n\r\nThen, briefly, he explained the reason.\r\n\r\n“It is raining still. Take my umbrella,” he said at the close of his\r\nsimply told story. “But tomorrow\u0027s sunshine will dry the field for the\r\ngame, all right. Good night.”\r\n\r\n“Good night,” Vincent Burgess said hoarsely, and plunged into the\r\ndarkness and the rain.\r\n\r\nTen steps from the Saxon House, he came plump into Bond Saxon, who\r\nstaggered a little to avoid him.\r\n\r\n“My luck on rainy nights,” Vincent thought. “The old fellow\u0027s sprees\r\nseem to run with the storms. He hasn\u0027t been \u0027off\u0027 for a long time.”\r\n\r\nBut Bond Saxon was never more sober in his life, and he clutched the\r\nyoung man\u0027s arm eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Professor Burgess, won\u0027t you help me!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to do on a night like this?” Burgess asked,\r\nremembering the vow he had been forced to make, by this same man.\r\n\r\n“Come help me save a man\u0027s life!” Bond urged.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Saxon. You\u0027ve got some wild notion out of a boot-legger\u0027s\r\nbottle. Straighten up now. It\u0027s an infamous thing in a college town like\r\nLagonda Ledge, where neither a saloon nor a joint would be allowed, that\r\nsome imp of Satan should forever be bringing you whisky. Who does it,\r\nanyhow?”\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m not drunk and haven\u0027t been for six months. Come on, for God\u0027s sake,\r\nand help me to save a life, maybe two lives, from the very man that\u0027s\r\ndone the boot-leggin\u0027 and robbin\u0027 in this town for months and months.”\r\n Saxon\u0027s words were convincing enough.\r\n\r\n“What can I do?” Burgess asked. “I\u0027m not a policeman.”\r\n\r\n“Come on! Come on!” Saxon urged, tugging at the professor\u0027s arm. “It \u0027s\r\na life, I tell you.”\r\n\r\nVincent yielded unwillingly, the night, the beating rain, the man who\r\nasked it of him, the purpose, his own unfitness--all holding him back.\r\nBefore they had gone far, Bond Saxon suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Say, Professor, do you remember the night I asked you to take care of\r\nDennie if anything should happen to me?”\r\n\r\n“Do YOU remember it?” Burgess responded. “You didn\u0027t ask; you demanded.”\r\n\r\n“I was drunk then. I\u0027m sober now. Burgess, if anything should happen to\r\nme now, would you still be willing?” Bond Saxon asked in tense anxiety.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve already taken oath,” Burgess said. “I think your daughter may need\r\nsomebody\u0027s care before anything happens if you keep up this gait.”\r\n\r\nThey hurried on through the rain until they had left the board walk and\r\nthe town lights, and were staggering along the cinder-made path, when\r\nBurgess halted.\r\n\r\n“Saxon, who\u0027s the man, or two men, you want to save? I believe you are\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\nBond Saxon grasped his arm, and said hoarsely:\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t shriek here. We are in danger, now. It\u0027s not two men. It\u0027s a man\r\nand a woman, maybe. It\u0027s Dean Funnybone. Come on!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE THIEF IN THE MOUTH\r\n\r\n _O, thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no,\r\n name to be known by, let us call thee, devil!_\r\n                    --SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\nWHEN Lloyd Fenneben could think again, the waters had receded, the\r\nrock ledge had turned to a pillow under his head, the river bank was a\r\nstraight white hospital wall, sunlight and sweet air for the darkness\r\nand the rain, and Norrie Wream was beside him instead of the brutal\r\nstranger. His heavy black hair was shorn away and his head was bound\r\nwith much soft cotton stuffs. His left arm was full of prickles, as if\r\nthe blood had just resumed circulation.\r\n\r\n“And meantime?” he said, looking up at Elinor.\r\n\r\n“Yes, meantime, it\u0027s June time,” Elinor replied.\r\n\r\n“Well, and what of Sunrise? Did we--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, we did. The college first. The ruling passion, strong in the\r\nhospital. When a Wream gets to kingdom-come, he always asks Saint\r\nPeter first for a mortar board and gown instead of a crown and wings.”\r\n Norrie\u0027s eyes were shining. “And he\u0027s a little particular about the\r\nlining of the wings, too--Purple, for Law; White, for Letters; Blue,\r\nfor Philosophy; Red, for Divinity. Take this quieting powder. College\r\npresidents should be seen and not heard.” She smilingly silenced him.\r\n\r\nUnder her gentle ministrations, Dr. Fenneben could picture what comfort\r\nmight be in store for Vincent Burgess in a day, doubtless only two years\r\naway. He resented Joshua Wream\u0027s estimate of Elinor. Surely Joshua had\r\nnever seen her in the place of nurse.\r\n\r\n“Now, meantime, Uncle Lloyd,” Elinor was saying, “commencement passed\r\noff beautifully under Acting-Dean Burgess, considering how sad and\r\nheavy-hearted everybody was. The trustees want to raise Professor\r\nBurgess\u0027s salary next year--he\u0027s so competent.”\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben\u0027s eyes were not bandaged, and as he looked at Elinor he\r\nwondered at her utter lack of reserve and sentiment, when she spoke of\r\nBurgess in such a frank, matter-of-fact way. When he was in love years\r\nago--but times must have changed.\r\n\r\n“The arrangements for next year are all looked after. Everything will be\r\ndone exactly as you would have it done. There\u0027s not one thing to put a\r\nworry into that cotton round your head.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Now, tell me of \u0027beforehand.\u0027” His smile was as charming as ever.\r\n\r\n“In your fever you\u0027ve been telling us about a one-armed man who had\r\ntwo arms to push people into the river, of his wanting you to save some\r\nchild\u0027s life, and of your stumbling over the stone. That\u0027s all we know\r\nabout that. Bond Saxon and Professor Burgess found you in the water at\r\nthe north bend in the Walnut close to that hermit woman\u0027s house. Either\r\nyou fell in, or somebody pushed you down the bank, headforemost, and\r\nyou struck a ledge of rock.” Elinor\u0027s eyes were full of tears now. “You\r\nwould have been drowned, if that white-haired woman had n\u0027t jumped in\r\nand held your head above water while she clung to the bushes with one\r\nhand. Her dog helped, too, like a real hero. It stood on the bank and\r\nheld to her shawl that she had fastened round you to hold you. And the\r\nriver was rising so fast, too. It was awful. I don\u0027t know just how it\r\nwas all managed, Uncle Lloyd, but it was managed between the woman and\r\nher dog at first, and Professor Burgess and Bond Saxon at last, and\r\nyou are safe now, and on the high road, the very elevated tracks, to\r\nrecovery. When your fever was the highest, the doctors kept telling me\r\nabout your splendid constitution and your temperate life. You must get\r\nwell now.”\r\n\r\nShe bent over him and softly caressed his hand.\r\n\r\n“Where is that woman now? Dennie Saxon asked me once to do something for\r\nher in her loneliness. She got ahead of my negligence and did something\r\nfor me, it seems.”\r\n\r\n“She left Lagonda Ledge the very day they rushed us up here to the\r\nhospital. Is n\u0027t she strange? And she is so gentle and sweet, but so\r\nsad. I never saw such apathetic face as hers, Uncle Lloyd.”\r\n\r\n“When did you see her?” Fenneben asked.\r\n\r\n“She came to ask after you. Nobody thought you would get over it.”\r\n Elinor\u0027s voice trembled. “The fever was burning you up and it took three\r\ndoctors to hold you. I saw her face when Dennie Saxon said they thought\r\nyou wouldn\u0027t pull through. Your own sister couldn\u0027t have turned whiter,\r\nUncle Lloyd.”\r\n\r\n“And the one-armed man I seemed to remember?”\r\n\r\n“I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve been too busy to ask many questions. Lagonda Ledge\r\nis in mourning for you. It will run up the flag above half-mast when I\r\nwrite how much better you are. Bond Saxon has a theory that some thief\r\nwanted to rob you and decoyed you away on pretense of helping somebody\r\nout of the river. You are an easy mark, Uncle.”\r\n\r\n“Why should Bond Saxon have a theory? And how did he know where to find\r\nme? And how did that gray-haired woman and her dog happen in on the\r\nscene just then? This is a grim sort of dime novel business, Norrie.\r\nThings don\u0027t fall out this way in real life unless there is some reason\r\nback of them. I think I\u0027ll bear investigating.”\r\n\r\n“I think so myself--you or your romantic rescuing squad. You might call\r\nthe dog to the witness stand first, for he was the first on the scene.\r\nI forgot though that the dog is dead. They found him down the river\r\nwith his throat cut. The plot thickens.” Elinor\u0027s frivolous spirit was\r\nreturning with the lessening of care.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about the ball game,” Fenneben said next.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it rained for hours and hours, and there wasn\u0027t any train service\r\nfor Lagonda Ledge for a week, and all the Inter-Collegiate Athletic\r\nevents for the season were called off for Sun rise-by-the-Walnut.”\r\n\r\n“And the students, generally?” Dr. Fenneben questioned.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Trench will be back,” Elinor exclaimed, “and folks have just found\r\nout that it\u0027s old Trench who\u0027s keeping that crippled boy in school, the\r\none they call \u0027Limpy.\u0027 Trench rustles jobs for him and divides his own\r\nincome for college expenses with the boy for the rest of the cost. I\r\ndon\u0027t know how the story got out, but I asked him about it when he was\r\nup here to see you. He just grinned and drawled lazily, \u0027I can save a\r\nlittle on shoe leather, that some fellows wear out hurrying so, and I\r\ndon\u0027t burst up so many hats with a swelled head as some do. So I keep a\r\nlittle extra change on these accounts. We\u0027re going down to Oklahoma when\r\nwe graduate. Limpy\u0027s going to be a Methodist preacher and I a stockman.\r\nI\u0027ll keep him in raw material for converts out of the cowboys I\u0027ll have\r\nto handle.\u0027 Isn\u0027t old Trenchy a hero? He says Dean Funnybone showed him\r\nhow to think about somebody else beside Trench a little bit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; Trench is a hero and I\u0027ve known about that whole thing for a\r\nlong while,” the Dean asserted. “And Victor Burleigh?”\r\n\r\nA shadow in the beautiful dark eyes, a half-tone lowering of the voice,\r\nand a general indifference of manner, as Elinor answered:\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know anything about him, except that he\u0027s coming back\r\nnext year.”\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben read the whole story in the words and manner of the answer,\r\nand he smiled grimly as he thought of Burgess and of the conflict of\r\nWream against Wream if Elinor and his brother Joshua ever came to the\r\nclash of arms. But he was too weak now to direct matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd meantime, while Lagonda Ledge was holding its breath in anxiety and\r\ndread, and all the churches were joining in union prayer service for the\r\nlife of their beloved Dean Fenneben, and the college year was ending\r\nin a halting between hope and dread--meantime, the same queries of Dr.\r\nFenneben as to motives were also queries in Professor Burgess\u0027 mind.\r\n\r\nTo the school and the town Dr. Fenneben\u0027s recovery was the only thing\r\nasked for. There was as yet no clew regarding the cause of the assault.\r\nBond Saxon had avoided Burgess since the event, so the young man himself\r\nmade occasion to get Bond up into Dr. Fenneben\u0027s study one June day just\r\nbefore commencement.\r\n\r\n“Saxon,” he said gravely, “you are a man of sense, and you know that\r\nthere\u0027s something wrong about this Fenneben assault. You\u0027ve put up some\r\nsmooth stories about our happening to be out at the bend of the river\r\nthat night, so I guess suspicion will be turned from us all right when\r\nLagonda Ledge gets time to think about causes; but I must be let into\r\nthe truth now.” Burgess was adamant now.\r\n\r\nFor a little while the old man looked away through the study window at\r\nthe prairie empire to be found for the looking.\r\n\r\n“Do you see that little twist of blue smoke over west?” he queried\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n“What of it?” Burgess asked.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, only the man huddlin\u0027 down round the fire makin\u0027 that smoke\r\nway down where it\u0027s cold and dark, that\u0027s the man who--say, Professor!”\r\n\r\nOld Bond looked up appealingly, and the pitiful face touched Burgess\u0027\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Saxon? Be frank now, but be fair, too. Sooner or later,\r\nthis thing must be run down. Fenneben will do it himself, anyhow, as\r\nsoon as he\u0027s well enough.”\r\n\r\n“Professor, I have asked you twice if you\u0027d be good to Dennie--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; you always come back to that. Anybody would be good to her,\r\nand she\u0027s a capable girl who does n\u0027t need anybody\u0027s care, anyhow. Now,\r\ngo on.”\r\n\r\n“I will”--it seemed an heroic resolve--“I asked this for Dennie, because\r\nmy own life is never safe.”\r\n\r\n“So you have said. Why not?” Burgess insisted. There was no way to evade\r\nthe question now.\r\n\r\n“That\u0027s my own business--just a little longer,” Bond answered slowly.\r\n“One thing more; I want your promise not to tell what I say--yet awhile.\r\nIt can\u0027t hurt anyone to keep still, and it will help some folks.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I\u0027ll help you all I can.” Burgess\u0027s kindly patience now was\r\nstrangely unlike the aristocratic, resentful man to whom old Bond Saxon\r\nhad appealed one stormy October night.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m a failure, Professor. I\u0027ve spoiled my life by my infernal weak will\r\nand appetite for whisky. I know it as well as you do. But I\u0027m not meant\r\nfor a bad man.” There was unspeakable pathos in Saxon\u0027s face and words.\r\n\r\n“Nobody would call you bad. You are a lovable man when you--keep\r\nstraight,” Burgess declared cordially.\r\n\r\n“I graduated from the university back in the sixties,” Bond went on.\r\n\r\n“You!” Burgess exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I\u0027m one of your alumni brothers from Harvard. It takes more \u0027n a\r\ncollege diploma to make a man sometimes, although this would mighty soon\r\nget to be a cheap, destructible nation, if we should pull the colleges\r\nout of it. The boys I\u0027ve seen Sunrise make into men does an old man\u0027s\r\nheart good to think about! But there\u0027s more than book-learning in a\r\nMaster\u0027s Degree. There must be MASTERY in it. I never got farther \u0027n\r\nan A.B., partly because Nature made me easy going, but mostly because\r\nwhisky ruined me. I finally came to Kansas. I\u0027d have had tremens long\r\nago but for that. But even here a man\u0027s got to keep the law inside, or\r\nno human law can prevent his making a beast of himself.”\r\n\r\nSaxon paused, and the professor waited.\r\n\r\n“The man that sets the cussed trap for me is a law breaker, an escaped\r\nconvict, and a murderer. That\u0027s what drinking did for him; drinking and\r\ninjustice in money matters together.”\r\n\r\nBurgess started and his face grew pale.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it\u0027s a fact, Professor. There are several roads to ruin. One by\r\nthe route I\u0027ve taken. One may be too much love of money, of women, or\r\nof having your own way. You can ruin your soul by getting it set on one\r\nthing above everything else. Education, for instance, like the Wreams\r\nback there in Cambridge.”\r\n\r\n“The Wreams!” Burgess exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, old Joshua Wream sold himself to an appetite for musty old\r\nSanscrit till he\u0027d sacrifice anybody\u0027s comfort and joy for it, same as I\r\nsold out to a fool\u0027s craving for drink. You\u0027ll know the Wreams sometime\r\nas I know \u0027em now. Fenneben\u0027s only a stepbrother and the West made a man\r\nof him. He was always a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Go on!” Vincent\u0027s voice was hardly audible.\r\n\r\n“This outlaw, boot-legger, thief, and murderer was a respectable fellow\r\nonce, the adopted son of a wealthy family back East, who began by\r\nspoiling him, lavished money on him, and let him have his own way in\r\neverything. He was a gay youngster on the side, given to drinking and\r\nfast company. He fell in love with a pretty girl, but when she found him\r\nout, she cut him. Then he went to the dogs, blaming her because she had\r\nsense enough to throw him over where he belonged. She fell in love--the\r\nright kind of love--with another man. And this young fool who had no\r\nclaim on her at all, swore vengeance. Her family wanted her to marry the\r\nyoung sport because he had money. They were long on money--her father\r\nwas, anyhow. But she would n\u0027t do it.”\r\n\r\n“Did she marry the one she really cared for?” Burgess asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No; but that\u0027s another story. Meantime this fellow\u0027s father died,\r\nleaving the boy he, himself, had started on the wrong road, entirely out\r\nof his will. The boy went to the devil--and he\u0027s still there.”\r\n\r\nSaxon paused and looked once more at the tiny wavering smoke column,\r\nhardly visible now.\r\n\r\n“He\u0027s over yonder hiding away from the light of day under the bluffs by\r\nthe fire that sends that curl of smoke up through the crevices in the\r\nrock, an outlaw thief.”\r\n\r\nSaxon gazed long at the landscape beyond the Walnut. When he spoke\r\nagain, it was with an effort.\r\n\r\n“Professor, this outlaw got a hold on me once when I was drunk, drunk\r\nby his making. It would do no good to tell you about that. You could n\u0027t\r\nhelp me, nor harm him. You\u0027ll trust me in this?”\r\n\r\nA picture of Dennie down in the Kickapoo Corral, with the flickering\r\nfirelight on her rippling hair, the weird, shadowy woodland, and the old\r\nIndian legend all came back to the young man now, though why he could\r\nnot say.\r\n\r\n“I certainly would never bring harm to you nor yours,” he said kindly.\r\n\r\n“I can\u0027t inform on the scoundrel. I can only watch him. The woman he was\r\nin love with years ago, who would n\u0027t stand for his wild ways--that\u0027s\r\nthe gray-haired woman at Pigeon Place. Her life\u0027s been one long tragedy,\r\nthough she is not forty yet.”\r\n\r\nThe anguish on the old man\u0027s face was pitiful as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“She has a reason of her own for living here, and she is the soul of\r\ncourage. On the night of the Fenneben accident, I was out her way--yes,\r\nrunning away from Bond Saxon. I knew if I stayed in town, I\u0027d get drunk\r\non a bottle left at my door. So I tore out in the rain and the dark to\r\nfight it out with the devil inside of me. And out at Pigeon Place I run\r\nonto this fiend. When I ordered him back to his hiding place, he vowed\r\nhe\u0027d get Fenneben and put him in the river. There\u0027s one or two human\r\nthings about him still. One is his fear of little children, and one is\r\nhis love for that woman. He really did adore her years ago. I tracked\r\nhome after him, and you know the rest. He put up some story to the Dean\r\nto entice him out there.”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, then ceased to speak.\r\n\r\n“Why the Dean?” Burgess asked.\r\n\r\n“Because Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s the man she loved years ago, and her folks\r\nwouldn\u0027t let her marry,” Bond Saxon said sadly.\r\n\r\nBurgess felt as if the limestone ridge was giving way beneath him.\r\n\r\n“Where is she now?”\r\n\r\n“She\u0027s gone, nobody knows where. I hope to heaven she will never come\r\nback,” the old man replied.\r\n\r\n“And it was she who saved Dr. Fenneben\u0027s life? Does he know who she is?”\r\n\r\n“No, no. She\u0027s never let him know, and if she does n\u0027t want him to know,\r\nwhose business is it to tell him?” Saxon urged. “I have hung about and\r\nprotected her when she never knew I was near. But when I\u0027m drunk, I\u0027m\r\nan idiot and my mind is bent against her. I\u0027d die to save her, and yet\r\nI may kill her some day when I don\u0027t know it.” Bond Saxon\u0027s head was\r\ndrooping pitifully low.\r\n\r\n“But why live in such slavery? Why not tell all you know about this man\r\nand let the law protect a helpless woman?” Burgess urged.\r\n\r\nOld Bond Saxon looked up and uttered only one word--“Dennie!”\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess turned away a moment. Dennie! Yes, there was Dennie.\r\n\r\n“This woman had a husband, you say?” he asked presently.\r\n\r\nBond Saxon stared straight at him and slowly nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“What became of him? Do you know?” Vincent questioned.\r\n\r\nSaxon leaned forward, and, clutching Vincent Burgess by the arm,\r\nwhispered hoarsely, “He\u0027s dead. I killed him. But I was drunk when I did\r\nit. And this man knows it and holds me bound.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVICE\r\n\r\n _If you were born to honor, show\r\n     it now;\r\n if put upon you, make the judgment\r\n     good that thought you\r\n     worthy of it_.\r\n               --SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.

In\r\nthe murderous attempt upon his life, he had been hurled, head-downward,\r\nupon the hidden rock-ledge with such force that even his strong nervous\r\nsystem could barely overcome the shock. Hours of unconsciousness were\r\nfollowed by a raging brain fever, and paralysis, insanity, and death\r\nstrove together against him. His final complete recovery was slow, and\r\nhe was wise enough to let nature have ample time for rebuilding what\r\nhad been so cruelly wrenched out of line. It was this very patience\r\nand willingness to take life calmly, when most men would have been in a\r\nfever of anxiety about neglected business, that brought Lloyd Fenneben\r\nback to Lagonda Ledge in December, a perfectly well man; and aside from\r\nthe holiday given in honor of the event, aside from the display of\r\nflags and the big “Welcome” done in electric lights awaiting him at the\r\nrailroad station, where all the portable population of Lagonda Ledge and\r\nmost of the Walnut Valley, headed by the Sunrise contingent, en masse,\r\nseemed to be waiting also--aside from the demonstration and general\r\nhilarity and thanksgiving and rejoicing, there seemed no difference\r\nbetween the Dean of the days that followed and the Dean of the years\r\nbefore. His black hair was as long and heavy as ever. His black eyes had\r\nlost nothing of their keenness. His smile was just the same old, genial\r\noutbreak of good will, as he heard the wildly enthusiastic refrain:\r\n\r\n Rah for Funnybone!\r\n Rah for Funnybone!\r\n Rah for Funnybone!\r\n _Rah!_ RAH!! RAH!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was twilight when the train pulled up to the station. The December\r\nevening was clear and crisp as southern Kansas Decembers usually are.\r\nThe lights of the town were twinkling in the dusk. Out beyond the river\r\na gorgeous purple and scarlet after-sunset glow was filling the west\r\nwith that magnificence of coloring only the hand of Nature dares to\r\npaint.\r\n\r\nSeveral passengers left the train, but the company had eyes only for the\r\nPullman car where Fenneben was riding. Nobody, except Bond Saxon, and\r\na cab driver on the edge of the crowd, noticed a gray-haired woman\r\nwho alighted so quietly and slipped to the cab so quickly that she was\r\nalmost out to Pigeon Place before Fenneben had been able to clear the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nBehind the Dean was his niece, who halted on the car steps while her\r\nuncle went into the outstretched arms of Lagonda Ledge. At sight of her,\r\nthe hats went high in air, as she stood there smiling above the crowd.\r\nIt was Maytime when she went away. They had remembered her in dainty\r\nMaytime gowns. They were not prepared for her in her handsome traveling\r\ncostume of golden brown, her brown beaver hat, and pretty furs. A\r\nbeautiful girl can be so charming in her winter feathers. She had\r\nexpected that Burgess would be first to meet her, and she was ready, she\r\nthought, to greet him, becomingly. But as the porter helped her to the\r\nplatform, the crowd closed in, shutting him away momentarily, and a hand\r\ncaught hers, a big, strong hand whose clasp, so close and warm, seemed\r\nto hold her hand by right of eternal possession. And Victor Burleigh\u0027s\r\nbrown eyes full of a joyous light were looking down at her. It was all\r\nsuch a sweet, shadowy time that nobody crowding about them could see\r\nclearly how Elinor, with shining face, nestled involuntarily close to\r\nhis arm for just one instant, and her low murmured words, “I am glad\r\nyou were first,” were lost to all but the big fellow before her, and\r\na bigger, vastly lazy fellow, Trench, just behind her. It was Trench\u0027s\r\nbulk that had blocked the way for the professor a moment before. Then\r\nshe was swallowed in the jolly greetings of goodfellowship, and Vincent\r\nBurgess carried her away to the carriage where her uncle waited.\r\n\r\n“The thing is settled now,” the young folks thought. But Dennie Saxon\r\nand Trench, who walked home together, knew that many things were\r\nhopelessly unsettled. By the law of natural fitness, Dennie and Trench\r\nshould have fallen in love with each other. They were so alike in\r\ngoodness of heart. But such mating of like with like, is rare, and under\r\nits ruling the world would grow so monotonously good, on the one hand,\r\nand bad, on the other, that life would be uninteresting.\r\n\r\nDuring Dr. Fenneben\u0027s absence, Professor Burgess was acting-dean. For a\r\nman who, two years before, had never heard of a Jayhawker, who hoped\r\nthe barren prairies would furnish seclusion for profound research in his\r\nlibrary, and whose interest in the student body lay in its material to\r\nfurnish “types,” Dean Burgess, on the outside, certainly measured\r\nup well toward the stature of the real Dean--broad-minded, beloved\r\n“Funnybone.”\r\n\r\nAnd as Vincent Burgess grew in breadth of view and human interest, his\r\npopularity increased and his opportunities multiplied. Sunrise forgot\r\nthat it had ever regarded him as a walking Greek textbook in paper\r\nbinding. Next to Dr. Lloyd Fenneben, his place at Sunrise would be the\r\nhardest to fill now; and withal, sometime in the near future, there was\r\nwaiting for him the prettiest girl that ever climbed the steps from the\r\nlower campus to the Sunrise door. Burgess had never dreamed that life in\r\nKansas could be so full of pleasure for him.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while, on the inside, another Burgess was growing up who\r\nquarreled daily with this happy outer Burgess. This inner man it was who\r\nheld the secret of Bond Saxon\u0027s awful crime; the man who knew the life\r\nstory of the would-be assassin of Lloyd Fenneben, and who knew the\r\ntragedy that had turned a fair-faced girl to a gray-haired woman, yet\r\nyoung in years. He knew the tragedy, but the woman herself he had never\r\nseen, save in the darkness and rain of that awful night when she had\r\nheld Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s head above the fast rising waters of the Walnut.\r\nHe had never even heard her voice, for he had sustained the limp body of\r\nDr. Fenneben while Saxon helped the woman from the river and as far\r\nas to her own gate. But these were secret things outside of his own\r\nconscience. Inside of his conscience the real battle was fought and won,\r\nand lost, only to be won and lost over and over. So long as Elinor\r\nWream was away, he could stay execution on himself. The same train that\r\nbrought her home to Lagonda Ledge, brought a letter to Professor Vincent\r\nBurgess, A.B. The letter heading bore as many of Dr. Joshua Wream\u0027s\r\ntitles as space would permit, but the cramped, old-fashioned handwriting\r\nbelonged to a man of more than fourscore years, and it was signed just\r\n“J. R.”\r\n\r\nBurgess read this letter many times that night after he returned from\r\ndinner at the Fenneben home. And sometimes his fists were clinched and\r\nsometimes his blue eyes were full of tears. Then he remembered\r\nlittle Bug, who had declared once that “Don Fonnybone was dood for\r\ntwoubleness.”\r\n\r\n“I can\u0027t take this to Fenneben,” he mused, as he read Joshua Wream\u0027s\r\nletter for the tenth time. “Nor can I go to Saxon. He\u0027s never sure of\r\nhimself and when he\u0027s drunk, he reverses himself and turns against\r\nhis best friends. And who am I to turn to a man like Bond Saxon for my\r\nconfidences?”\r\n\r\n“What about Elinor?” came a voice from somewhere. “The woman you would\r\nmake your wife should be the one to whose loving sympathy you could turn\r\nat any of life\u0027s angles, else that were no real marriage.”\r\n\r\n“Elinor, of all people in the world, the very last. She shall never\r\nknow, never!” So he answered the inward questioner.\r\n\r\nDimly then rose up before him the picture of Victor Burleigh on the\r\nrainy May night when he stood beside little Bug Buler\u0027s bed--Victor\r\nBurleigh, with his white, sorrowful face, and burning brown eyes,\r\ntelling in a voice like music the reason why he must renounce athletic\r\nhonors in Sunrise.\r\n\r\nBurgess had been unconsciously exultant over the boy\u0027s confession. It\r\nwould put the confessor out of reach of any claim to Elinor\u0027s friendship\r\nwhen the truth was known about his poverty and his professional playing.\r\nAnd yet he had followed Bond Saxon\u0027s lead the more willingly that night\r\nthat he was hating himself for rejoicing with himself.\r\n\r\nOn this December night, with Elinor once more in Lagonda Ledge, Victor\r\nBurleigh must come again to trouble him. What a price that boy must\r\nhave paid for his honesty! But he paid it, aye, he paid it! And then\r\nthe rains put out the game and nobody knew except Burleigh and himself.\r\nBurgess almost resented the kindness of Fate to the heroic boy. But all\r\nthis solved no problems for Vincent Burgess, except the realization\r\nthat here was one fellow who had a soul of courage. Could he confide in\r\nBurleigh? Not in a thousand years!\r\n\r\nIn utter loneliness, Vincent Burgess put out his light and stared at the\r\nwindow. The street lamps glowed in lonely fashion, for it was very late,\r\nand nobody was abroad. Up on the limestone ridge, the Sunrise beacon\r\nshone bravely. Down in town beside the campus gate--he could just\r\ncatch a glimpse of one steady beam. It was the faithful old lamp in the\r\nhallway of the Saxon House, and beyond that unwavering light was Dennie.\r\n\r\n“Dennie! Why have I not thought of her? The only one in the world whom I\r\ncan fully trust. That ought to be a man\u0027s sweetheart, I suppose, but she\r\nis not mine. She is just Dennie. Heaven bless her! I\u0027ve sworn to care\r\nfor her. She must help me now.” And with the comforting thought, he fell\r\nasleep beside the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe December sunset was superb in a glory of endless purple mists and\r\nrose-tinted splendor of far-reaching skies. The evening drops down early\r\nat this season and the lights were gleaming here and there in the town\r\nwhere the shadows fall soonest before the day\u0027s work is finished up in\r\nSunrise.\r\n\r\nVictor Burleigh, who had been called to Dr. Fenneben\u0027s study, found only\r\nElinor there, looking out at the radiant beauty of the sunset sky beyond\r\nthe homey shadows studded with the twinkling lights of Lagonda Ledge at\r\nthe foot of the slope. The young man hesitated a little before entering.\r\nAll day the school had been busy settling affairs for Professor Burgess\r\nand “Norrie, the beloved.” Gossip has swift feet and from surmise to\r\nfact is a short course. Twenty-four hours had quite completely “fixed\r\nthings” for Elinor Wream and Vincent Burgess, so far as Sunrise and\r\nLagonda Ledge were able to fix them. So Burleigh, whose strong face\r\ncarried no hint of grief, held back a minute now, before entering the\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, Elinor. Dr. Fenneben sent for me.”\r\n\r\nSomehow the deep musical voice and her name pronounced as nobody else\r\never could pronounce it, and the big manly form and brave face, all\r\nseemed to complete the spell of the sunset hour. Elinor did not speak,\r\nbut with a smile made room for him beside her at the window, and the\r\ntwo looked long at the deepening grandeur of the heavens and the misty\r\nshadows of heliotrope and silver darkening softly to the twilight below\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“And God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the\r\nfourth day,” Victor said at last.\r\n\r\n“Your voice grows richer with the passing years, Victor,” Elinor said\r\nsoftly. “I wanted to hear it again the first time I heard you speak out\r\nthere one September day.”\r\n\r\n“It is well to grow rich in something,” Victor said, half-earnestly,\r\nhalf-carelessly.\r\n\r\nBefore Elinor could say more, they caught sight of Professor Burgess\r\nand Dennie Saxon, leaving the front portico as they had done on the May\r\nevening before the assault on Dr. Fenneben. Burgess and Dennie usually\r\nleft the building together this year.\r\n\r\n“Is n\u0027t Dennie a darling? Elinor said calmly.\r\n\r\n“I guess so,” he replied. “I don\u0027t just know what makes a girl a darling\r\nto another girl. I only know”--he was on thin ice now--“and I don\u0027t even\r\nknow that very well.”\r\n\r\nThey turned to the landscape again. The whole building was growing\r\nquiet. Footsteps were fading away down the halls. Doors clicked faintly\r\nhere and there. Somebody was singing softly in the basement laboratory,\r\nand the sunset sky was exquisitely lovely above the quiet gray December\r\nprairies.\r\n\r\n“It is too beautiful to last,” Elinor said, turning to the young man\r\nbeside her. “The joy of it is too deep for us to hold.”\r\n\r\nShe did not mean to stay a moment longer, for all the scene could be\r\nhers forever in memory--imperishable!--and Victor did not mean to detain\r\nher. But her face as she turned from the window, the hallowed setting\r\nof time and opportunity, and a heart-love hungering through hopeless,\r\nslow-dragging months, all had their own way with him. He put out his\r\narms to her and she nestled within them, lifting a face to his own\r\ntransfigured with love\u0027s sweetness. And he bent and kissed her red lips,\r\nholding her close in his arms. And in the shadowy twilight, with the\r\nfaintly roseate banners of the sunset\u0027s after-glow trailing through it,\r\nfor just one minute, heaven and earth came very near together for these\r\ntwo. And then they remembered, and Elinor put her hand in Victor\u0027s, who\r\nheld it in his without a word.\r\n\r\nOut in the hall, Trench with soft lazy step had just come to the study\r\ndoor in time to see and turn away unseen, and slowly pass out of the big\r\nfront door, whistling low the while:\r\n\r\n My sweetheart lives on the prairies wide\r\n     By the sandy Cimarron,\r\n In a day to come she will be my bride,\r\n     By the sandy Cimarron.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut by the big stone pillars of the portico, he looked toward the south\r\nturret and saw Dr. Fenneben as Vic had seen Elinor on the evening of\r\nthe May storm. He did not call, but with a twist of the fingers as of\r\nunlocking a door, he dodged back into the building and up to the chapel\r\nend of the turret stairs to release the Dean.\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben had started down to the study by the same old “road to\r\nperdition” stairs and paused at the window as Dennie and Burgess were\r\npassing out, unconscious of three pairs of eyes on them. Then the Dean\r\nsaw down through the half-open study door the two young people by the\r\nwindow, and he knew he was not needed there. What that look in his black\r\neyes meant, as he turned to the half-way window of the turret, it would\r\nhave been hard to read. And the picture of a fair-faced girl came back\r\nto his own hungry memory. He was trying to calculate the distance from\r\nthe turret window to the ground when Trench wig-wagged a rescue signal.\r\n\r\n“You are a brick, Trench,” he said, as the upper stairway door swung\r\nopen to release him.\r\n\r\n“You\u0027ve the whole chimney,” Trench responded, as he swung himself away.\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben met Elinor in the rotunda.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, Norrie, and I\u0027ll walk home with you.”\r\n\r\nIn the study he met Burleigh, whose stern face was tender with a\r\npathetic sadness, but there was no embarrassment in his glance. And\r\nFenneben, being a man himself, knew what power for sacrifice lay back of\r\nthose beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\n“I can\u0027t give him the message I meant to give now. The man said there\r\nwas no hurry. A veritable tramp he looked to be. I hope there is no harm\r\nto the boy in it. Why should a girl like Norrie love the pocketbook, and\r\nthe things of the pocketbook, when a heart like Victor Burleigh\u0027s calls\r\nto her? I know men. I never shall know women.” So he thought. Aloud he\r\nsaid: “I was detained, Burleigh, and I\u0027ll have to see you again. I have\r\nsome matters to consider with you soon.”\r\n\r\nAnd Burleigh wondered much what “some matters” might be.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Burgess left Dennie he said, lightly:\r\n\r\n“Miss Dennie, I need a little help in my work. Would you let me call\r\nthis evening and talk it over with you? I don\u0027t believe anybody else\r\nwould get hold of it quite so well.”\r\n\r\nDennie had supposed this first evening after Elinor\u0027s return would\r\nfind her lover making use of it. Why should Dennie not feel a thrill of\r\npleasure that her services out-weighed everything else? Poor Dennie! She\r\nwas no flirt, but much association with Vincent Burgess had given her\r\ninsight to know that Norrie Wream would never understand him.\r\n\r\nWhen Burgess returned to the Saxon House later in the evening, he met\r\nBond Saxon at the door.\r\n\r\n“Say, Professor, the devil will be to pay again. That Mrs. Marian is\r\nback. Got here on the same train Funnybone came on. And,” lowering his\r\nvoice, “he will be over there again,” pointing toward the west bluffs.\r\n“He\u0027ll hound Funnybone to his doom yet. And she--she\u0027ll stand between\r\n\u0027em to the last. I told you one of the two human traits left in that\r\nbeast is his fool fondness for that woman who wouldn\u0027t let him set foot\r\non her ground if she knew it. It\u0027s a grim tragedy being played out here\r\nwith nobody knowing but you and me.”\r\n\r\n“Saxon, I\u0027m in no mood for all this tonight,” Burgess said, “but for\r\nyour daughter\u0027s sake keep away from the man\u0027s bottle now.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for Dennie\u0027s sake--” Bond looked imploringly at Burgess.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I\u0027ll do my duty as I promised. But why not do it yourself\r\ntoward her? Why not be a man and a father?”\r\n\r\n“Me! A criminal! Do you know what that kind of slavery is?” Saxon\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n“Almost,” Burgess answered, but the old man did not catch his meaning.\r\n\r\nDennie was waiting in the parlor, a cosy little room but without the\r\nluxurious appointments of Norrie Wream\u0027s home. Yet tonight Dennie seemed\r\nbeautiful to Burgess, and this quiet little room, a haven of safety.\r\n\r\n“Dennie,” he said, plunging into his purpose at once. “I come to you\r\nbecause I need a friend and you are tempered steel.”\r\n\r\nTonight Dennie\u0027s gray eyes were dark and shining. The rippling waves of\r\nyellow brown hair gave a sort of Madonna outline to her face, and there\r\nwas about her something indefinably pleasant.\r\n\r\n“What can I do for you, Professor Burgess?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Dennie, and then advise me.”\r\n\r\nWas this the acting-dean of Sunrise, a second Fenneben, already\r\ndeclared? His face was full of pathos, yet even in his feverish grief\r\nit seemed a better face to Dennie than the cold scholarly countenance of\r\ntwo years ago.\r\n\r\n“My troubles go back a long way. My father was given to greed. He sold\r\nhimself and my sister\u0027s happiness and mine for money. You think your\r\nfather is a slave, Dennie, because he has a craving for whisky. Less\r\nthan half a dozen times a year the demon inside gets him down.”\r\n\r\nDennie looked up with a sorrowful face.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but think of what he might do. You don\u0027t know what dreadful things\r\nhe has done--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do. He told me himself the very worst. I\u0027ll never betray him,\r\nDennie. His punishment is heavy enough.”\r\n\r\nBurgess laid his hand on her dimpled hand in token of sincerity.\r\n\r\n“But that\u0027s only rarely, little girl. My father every day in the year\r\ngave himself to an appetite for money till he cared for nothing else.\r\nMy sister, who died believing that I also had turned against her, was\r\nforced to marry a man she did not love because he had money. I never\r\nknew the man she did love. It was a romance of her girlhood. I was away\r\nfrom home the most of my boyhood years, and she never mentioned his name\r\nafter the affair was broken off. All I know is that she was deceived and\r\nmade to believe some cruel story against him. She and her husband came\r\nWest, where they died. My father never forgave them for going West, nor\r\npermitted me to speak her name to him. I never knew why until yesterday.\r\nMy sister\u0027s husband had a brother out here with whom he meant to divide\r\nsome possessions he had inherited. That settled him with my father\r\nforever. There was no DIVISION of property in his creed.”\r\n\r\nBurgess paused. Dennie\u0027s interest and sympathy made her silent company a\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n“I was heir to my father\u0027s estate, and heir also to some funds he held\r\nin trust. I was a scholar with ambition for honors--a Master\u0027s Degree\r\nand a high professional place in a great university. I trusted my whole\r\nlife plans to the man who knew my father best--Dr. Joshua Wream.”\r\n\r\nDennie looked up, questioningly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, to Elinor\u0027s uncle, as unlike Dr. Fenneben as night and day.”\r\n\r\n“Do not blame me, Dennie, if two men have helped to misshape my life.\r\nMy father believed that money is absolute. Dr. Wream holds scholarly\r\nachievement as the greatest life work. It has been Dr. Fenneben\u0027s part\r\nto show me the danger and the power in each.”\r\n\r\nIt was dimly dawning on Burgess that the presence of Dennie, good,\r\nsensible Dennie, was a blessing outside of these things that could go\r\nfar toward making life successful. But he did not grasp it clearly yet.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Wream and I made a compact before I came West. It seemed fair to me\r\nthen. By its terms I was assured, first, of my right to certain funds\r\nmy father held in trust. It was Wream who secured these rights for me.\r\nSecond, I was to succeed to his chair in Harvard if I proved worthy in\r\nSunrise. In return I promised to marry Elinor Wream and to provide for\r\nher comfort and luxury with these trust funds my father and Wream had\r\nsomehow been manipulating.”\r\n\r\nOh, yes! Dennie was level-headed. And because she did not look up nor\r\ncry out Vincent Burgess did not see nor guess anything. His life had\r\nbeen a sheltered one. How could he measure Dennie\u0027s life-discipline in\r\nself-control and loving bravery?\r\n\r\n“Elinor was heavy on Wream\u0027s conscience,” Vincent went on, “because he\r\nand her father, Dr. Nathan Wream, took the fortune to endow colleges and\r\nuniversity chairs that should have been hers from her mother\u0027s estate.\r\nYou see, Dennie, there was no wrong in the plan. Elinor would be\r\nprovided for by me. I would get up in my chosen profession. Nobody was\r\nrobbed or defrauded. Joshua Wream\u0027s last years would be peaceful with\r\nhis conscience at rest regarding Elinor\u0027s property. And, Dennie, who\r\nwould n\u0027t want to marry Elinor Wream?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, who wouldn\u0027t?” Dennie looked up with a smile. And if there were\r\ntears in her eyes Burgess knew they were born of Dennie\u0027s sweet spirit\r\nof sympathy.\r\n\r\n“What is wrong, then?” she asked. “Is Elinor unwilling?”\r\n\r\n“Elinor and I are bound by promises to each other, although no word has\r\never been spoken between us. It is impossible to make any change now. We\r\nare very happy, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Dennie echoed.\r\n\r\n“I had a letter from Dr. Wream last night. A pitiful letter, for he\u0027s\r\ngetting near the brink. Dennie--these funds I hold--I have never quite\r\nunderstood, but I had felt sure there was no other claimant. There was\r\na clause in the strangely-worded bequest: \u0027for V. B. and his heirs.\r\nFailing in that, to the nearest related V. B.\u0027 It was a thing for\r\nlawyers, not Greek professors, to settle, and I came to be the nearest\r\nrelated V. B., Vincent Burgess, for I find the money belonged to my\r\nsister\u0027s husband, and I thought he left no heirs and I am the nearest\r\nrelated V. B. by marriage, you see?”\r\n\r\n“Well?” Dennie\u0027s mind was jumping to the end.\r\n\r\n“My sister married a Victor Burleigh, who came to Kansas to find his\r\nbrother. Both men are dead now. The only one of the two families living\r\nis this brother\u0027s son, young Victor Burleigh, junior in Sunrise College.\r\nHe knows nothing of his Uncle Victor, my brother-in-law--nor of money\r\nthat he might claim. He belongs to the soil out here. Nobody has any\r\nclaims on him, nor has he any ambition for a chair in Harvard, nor any\r\npromise to marry and provide for a beautiful girl who looks upon him as\r\nher future guardian.”\r\n\r\nVincent Burgess suddenly ceased speaking and looked at Dennie.\r\n\r\n“I cannot break an old man\u0027s heart. He implores me not to reveal all\r\nthis, but I had to tell somebody, and you are the best friend a man\r\ncould ever have, Dennie Saxon, so I come to you,” he added presently.\r\n\r\n“When did this Dr. Wream find out about Vic?” Dennie asked.\r\n\r\n“A month ago. Some strange-looking tramp of a fellow brought him proofs\r\nthat are incontestable,” Burgess replied.\r\n\r\n“And it is for an old man\u0027s peace you would keep this secret?” Dennie\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n“For him and for Elinor--and for myself. Don\u0027t hate me, Dennie. Elinor\r\nlooks upon me as her future husband. I have promised to provide for\r\nher with the comforts denied her by her father, and I have lived in the\r\nambition of holding that Harvard chair--Oh, it is all a hopeless tangle.\r\nI could never go to Victor Burleigh now. He would not believe that I had\r\nbeen ignorant of his claim all this time. He was never wrapped up in the\r\npursuit of a career--Oh, Dennie, Dennie, what shall I do?”\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and Dennie stood up before him. He gently rested his\r\nhands on her shoulders and looked down at her.\r\n\r\n“What shall you do?” Dennie repeated, slowly. “Whisky, Money,\r\nAmbition--the appetite that destroys! Vincent Burgess, if you want to\r\nwin a Master\u0027s Degree, win to the Mastery of Manhood first. The sins of\r\nthe fathers, yours and mine, we cannot undo. But you can be a man.”\r\n\r\nShe had put her dimpled hands on his arms as they stood there, and\r\nthe brave courage of her upturned face called back again the rainy May\r\nnight, and the face of Victor Burleigh beside Bug Buler\u0027s cot, and his\r\nlow voice as he said:\r\n\r\n“I cannot play in tomorrow\u0027s game and be a man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. THE SILVER PITCHER\r\n\r\n _A picket frozen on duty--\r\n     A mother starved for her brood--\r\n     Socrates drinking the hemlock,\r\n     And Jesus on the rood.\r\n And millions who, humble and nameless,\r\n     The straight hard pathway trod--\r\n     Some call it Consecration,\r\n     And others call it God_.\r\n          --WILLIAM HERBERT CARRUTH\r\n\r\n“DR. FENNEBEN, I should like much to dismiss my classes for the\r\nafternoon,” Professor Burgess said to the Dean in his study the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Professor, I am afraid you are overworked with all my duties\r\nadded to yours here. But you don\u0027t look it,” Fenneben said, smiling.\r\n\r\nBurgess was growing almost stalwart in this gracious climate.\r\n\r\n“I am very well, Doctor. What a beautiful view this is.” He was looking\r\nintently now at the Empire that had failed to interest him once.\r\n\r\n“Yes; it is my inspiration. \u0027Each man\u0027s chimney is his golden\r\nmilestone,\u0027” Fenneben quoted. “I\u0027ve watched the smoke from many\r\nchimneys up and down the Walnut Valley during my years here, and later\r\nI\u0027ve hunted out the people of each hearthstone and made friends with\r\nthem. So when I look away from my work here I see friendly tokens of\r\nthose I know out there.” He waved his hand toward the whole valley.\r\n“And maybe, when they look up here and see the dome by day, or catch\r\nour beacon light by night, they think of \u0027Funnybone,\u0027 too. It is well to\r\nlive close to the folks of your valley always.”\r\n\r\n“You are a wonderful man, Doctor,” Burgess said.\r\n\r\n“There are two \u0027milestones\u0027 I\u0027ve never reached,” the Doctor went on.\r\n“One is that place by the bend in the river. See the pigeons rising\r\nabove it now. I wonder if that strange white-haired woman ever came back\r\nagain. Elinor said she left Lagonda Ledge last summer.”\r\n\r\n“Where\u0027s the other place?” Burgess would change the subject.\r\n\r\n“It i\u0027s a little shaft of blue smoke from a wood fire rising above\r\nthose rocky places across the river. I\u0027ve seen it so often, at irregular\r\ntimes, that I\u0027ve grown interested in it, but I have missed it since I\r\ncame back. It\u0027s like losing a friend. Every man has his vagaries. One of\r\nmine is this friendship with the symbols of human homes.”\r\n\r\nBurgess offered no comment in response. He could not see that the time\r\nhad come to tell Fenneben what Bond Saxon had confided to him about the\r\nman below the smoke. So he left the hilltop and went down to the Saxon\r\nHouse. He wanted to see Dennie, but found her father instead.\r\n\r\n“That woman\u0027s left Pigeon Place again,” Saxon said. “Went early this\r\nmorning. It\u0027s freedom for me when I don\u0027t have to think of them two.\r\nThinking of myself is slavery enough.”\r\n\r\nBurgess loitered aimlessly about the doorway for a while. It was a mild\r\nafternoon, with no hint of winter, nor Christmas glitter of ice and snow\r\nabout it. Just a glorious finishing of an idyllic Kansas autumn rounding\r\nout in the beauty of a sunshiny mid-December day. But to the man who\r\nstood there, waiting for nothing at all, the day was a mockery. Behind\r\nthe fine scholarly face a storm was raging and there was only one friend\r\nwhom he could trust--Dennie.\r\n\r\n“Let\u0027s go walking, you and me!”\r\n\r\nBug Buler put up one hand to Burgess, while he clutched a little red\r\nball in the other. Bug had an irresistible child voice and child touch,\r\nand Burgess yielded to their leading. He had not realized until now\r\nhow lonely he was, and Bug was companionable by intuition and a stanch\r\nlittle stroller.\r\n\r\nNorth of town the river lay glistening between its vine-draped banks.\r\nThe two paused at the bend where Fenneben had been hurled almost to his\r\ndoom, and Burgess remembered the darkness, and the rain, and the limp\r\nbody he had held. He thought Fenneben was dead then, and even in that\r\nmoment he had felt a sense of disloyalty to Dennie as he realized that\r\nhe must think of Elinor entirely now. But why not? He had come to Kansas\r\nfor this very thinking. It must be his life purpose now.\r\n\r\nToday Burgess began to wonder why Elinor must have a life of ease\r\nprovided for her and Dennie Saxon ask for nothing. Why should Joshua\r\nWream\u0027s conscience be his burden, too? Then he hated himself a little\r\nmore than ever, and duty and manly honor began their wrestle within him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Let\u0027s we go see the pigeons,” Bug suggested, tossing his ball in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBurgess remembered what Bond had said of the woman\u0027s leaving. There\r\ncould be no harm in going inside, he thought. The leafless trees\r\nand shrubbery revealed the neat little home that the summer foliage\r\nconcealed. Bug ran forward with childish curiosity and tiptoed up to a\r\nlow window, dropping his little red ball in his eagerness.\r\n\r\n“Oh, tum! tum!” he cried. “Such a pretty picture frame and vase on the\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\nHe was nearly five years old now, but in his excitement he still used\r\nbaby language, as he pulled eagerly at Vincent Burgess\u0027 coat.\r\n\r\n“It isn\u0027t nice to peep, Bug,” Burgess insisted, but he shaded his eyes\r\nand glanced in to please the boy. He did not note the pretty gilt frame\r\nnor the vase beside it on the table. But the face looking out of that\r\nframe made him turn almost as cold and limp as Fenneben had been when\r\nhe was dragged from the river. Catching the little one by the hand he\r\nhurried away.\r\n\r\nAt the gateway he lifted Bug in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe was not yet at ease with children.\r\n\r\n“I dropped my ball,” Bug said. “Let me det it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; I\u0027ll get you another one. Don\u0027t go back,” Burgess urged. “Do\r\nyou know it is very rude to look into windows. Let\u0027s never tell anybody\r\nwe did it; nor ever, ever do it again. Will you remember?”\r\n\r\n“Umph humph! I mean, yes, sir! I won\u0027t fornever do it again, nor tell\r\nnobody.” Bug buttoned up his lips for a sphinx-like secrecy. “Nobody but\r\nDennie. And I may fordet it for her.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, forget it, and we\u0027ll go away up the river and see other things.\r\nBug, what do you say when you want to keep from doing wrong?”\r\n\r\nBug looked up confidingly.\r\n\r\n“I ist say, \u0027Dod, be merciless to me, a sinner\u0027.”\r\n\r\n“Why not merciful, Bug?”\r\n\r\n“Tause! If He\u0027s merciful it\u0027s too easy and I\u0027m no dooder,” Bug said,\r\nwisely.\r\n\r\n“Who told you the difference?” Burgess asked.\r\n\r\n“Vic. He knows a lot. I wish I had my ball, but let\u0027s go up the river.”\r\n\r\n“Out of the mouths of babes,” Burgess murmured and hugged the little one\r\nclose to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nVictor Burleigh was in the little balcony of the dome late that\r\nafternoon fixing a defective wiring. Through the open windows he could\r\nsee the skyline in every direction. The far-reaching gray prairie,\r\noverhung by its dome of amethyst bordered round with opal and rimmed\r\nwith jasper, seemed in every blending tint and tone to call him back to\r\nNorrie. The west bluff above the old Kickapoo Corral in the autumn, the\r\nglen full of shadow-flecked light under the tender young April\r\nleaves, the December landscape as it lay beyond Dr. Fenneben\u0027s study\r\nwindows--these belonged to Elinor. And all of them were blended in this\r\nvision of inexpressible grandeur, unfolded to him now from the dome\u0027s\r\nhigh vantage place.\r\n\r\n“Twice Norrie has let me hold her in my arms and kiss her,” he mused.\r\n“When I do that the third time it must be when there will be no remorse\r\nto hound me afterward.” He looked down the winding Walnut toward the\r\nwhirlpool. “I\u0027d rather swim that water than flounder here.”\r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps on the rotunda stairs made him turn to see\r\nVincent Burgess just reaching the little balcony of the dome.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ve come to have a word with you up here,” he said. “We met once\r\nbefore in this rotunda.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, down there in the arena,” Vic replied, recalling how like a beast\r\nhe had felt then. “I was a young hyena that day. Bug Buler came just\r\nin time to save both of us. There is a comfort in feeling we can learn\r\nsomething. I\u0027ve needed books and college professors to temper me to\r\ncourtesy.”\r\n\r\nIt was the only apology Vic had ever offered to Burgess, who accepted it\r\nas all that he deserved.\r\n\r\n“We learn more from men than from books sometimes. I\u0027ve learned from\r\nthem how courageous a man may be when the need for sacrifice comes. Sit\r\ndown, Burleigh, and let me tell you something.”\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the low seat beside the dome windows. Overhead gleamed\r\nthe message of high courage, _Ad Astra Per Aspera_. Below was the\r\nartistic beauty of the rotunda, where the evening shadows were\r\ndeepening.\r\n\r\n“We are higher than we were that other day. We care less for fighting as\r\nwe get farther up, maybe,” Burgess said, pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“The only place to fight a man is in a cave, anyhow,” Burleigh replied,\r\nlooking at his brawny arms, nor dreaming how prophetic his words might\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n“We don\u0027t belong to that class of men now, whatever our far off\r\nancestors may have been, but we are the sons of our fathers, Burleigh,\r\nand it is left to the living to right the wrongs the dead have begun.”\r\n\r\nThen, briefly, Vincent Burgess, A.B., Greek Professor from Harvard, told\r\nto Vic Burleigh from a prairie claim out beyond the Walnut, a part of\r\nwhat he had already told to Dennie Saxon, of the funds withheld from him\r\nso long. Told it in general terms, however, not shielding his father\r\nat all, but giving no hint that the first Victor Burleigh was his own\r\nbrother-in-law. And of the compact with Joshua Wream and of Norrie he\r\ntold nothing.\r\n\r\n“Three days ago I did not know that you could be heir to this property,”\r\n he concluded. “I\u0027ve been interested in books and have left legal matters\r\nto those who controlled them for me.”\r\n\r\nHe rose hastily, for Burleigh, saying nothing, was looking at him with\r\nwide-open brown eyes that seemed to look straight into his soul.\r\n\r\n“I can restore your property to you. I cannot change the past. You have\r\nall the future in which to use it better than my father did, or I might\r\nhave done. Goodnight.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away and passed slowly down the rotunda stairs.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone Victor Burleigh turned to the open window of the\r\ndome. He was not to blame that the beautiful earth under a magnificent\r\nDecember sunset sky seemed all his own now.\r\n\r\n“\u0027If big, handsome Victor Burleigh had his corners knocked off and was\r\nsandpapered down,\u0027” he mused. “Well, what corners I haven\u0027t knocked off\r\nmyself have been knocked off for me and I\u0027ve been sandpapered--Lord,\r\nI\u0027ve been sandpapered down all right. I\u0027m at home on a carpet now. \u0027And\r\nif he had money\u0027.” Vic\u0027s face was triumphant. “It has come at last--the\r\nmoney. And what of Elinor?”\r\n\r\nThe sacred memories of brief fleeting moments with her told him “what of\r\nElinor.”\r\n\r\n“The barriers are down now. It is a glorious old world. I must hunt up\r\nTrench and then--”\r\n\r\nHe closed the dome window, looked a moment at the brave Kansas motto,\r\nradiant in the sunset light, and then, picking up his tools, he went\r\ndownstairs.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Trench I he called as he reached the rotunda floor. I must see\r\nyou a minute.”\r\n\r\n“Hello, you Angel-face! Case of necessity. Well, look a minute,” Trench\r\ndrawled. “But that\u0027s the limit, and twice as long as I\u0027d care to see\r\nyou, although, I was hunting you. Funnybone wants to see you in there.”\r\n\r\nVictor\u0027s eyes were glowing with a golden light as he entered Fenneben\u0027s\r\nstudy, and the Dean noted the wonderful change from the big, awkward\r\nfellow with a bulldog countenance to this self-poised gentleman whose\r\nfine face it was a joy to see.\r\n\r\n“I have a message for you, Burleigh. No hurry about it I was told, but\r\nI am called away on important business and I must get it out of my mind.\r\nAn odd-looking fellow called at my door on the night I came home and\r\nleft a package for you. He said he had tried to find you and failed,\r\nthat he was a stranger here, and that you would understand the message\r\ninside. He insisted on not giving this in any hurry, and as my coming\r\nhome has brought me a mass of things to consider, I have not been prompt\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nFenneben put a small package into Burleigh\u0027s hands.\r\n\r\n“Examine it here, if you care to. You can fasten the door when you\r\nleave. Goodby!” and he was gone.\r\n\r\nVictor sat down and opened the package. Inside was a quaint little\r\nsilver pitcher, much ornamented, with the initial B embossed on the\r\nsmooth side.\r\n\r\n“The lost pitcher--stolen the day my mother died--and I was warned never\r\nto try to find who stole it.” He turned to the light of the west window.\r\n\r\n“It is the very thing I found in the cave that night. The man who took\r\nit may have been over there.” He glanced out of the window and saw a\r\nthin twist of blue smoke rising above the ledges across the river.\r\n\r\n“Who can have had it all this time, and why return it now?” he\r\nquestioned. As he turned the pitcher in his hands a paper fell out.\r\n\r\n“The message inside!” He spread out the paper and read “the message\r\ninside.”\r\n\r\nWell for him that Dr. Fenneben had left him alone. The shining face and\r\neyes aglow changed suddenly to a white, hard countenance as he read this\r\nmessage inside. It ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n“Victor Burleigh. First, don\u0027t ever try to follow me. The day you do\r\nI\u0027ll send you where I sent your father. No Burleigh can stay near me and\r\nlive. Now be wise.\r\n\r\n“Second. You saved the baby I left in the old dugout. Before God I never\r\nmeant to kill it then. The thought of it has cursed my soul night and\r\nday till I found out you had saved him.\r\n\r\n“Third. The girl you want to marry--go and marry. Do anything, good or\r\nbad, to destroy Burgess.\r\n\r\n“Fourth. The money Burgess had is yours, only because I\u0027m giving it to\r\nyou. It belongs to Bug Buler. He couldn\u0027t talk plain when you saved him.\r\nHe\u0027s not Bug Buler; he\u0027s Bug Burleigh, son of Victor Burleigh, heir to\r\nV. B.\u0027s money in the law. I\u0027ve got all the proofs. You see why you can\r\nhave that money. Nobody will ever know but me. Don\u0027t hunt for me and\r\nI\u0027ll never tell. TOM GRESH.”\r\n\r\nThe paper fell from Victor Burleigh\u0027s hands. The world, that ten minutes\r\nago was a rose-hued sunset land, was a dreary midnight waste now. The\r\none barrier between himself and Elinor had fallen only to rise up again.\r\n\r\nThen came Satan into the game. “Nobody knew this but Gresh! Who had\r\nsaved Bug\u0027s life? Who had cared for him and would always care for him?\r\nWhy should Bug, little, loving Bug, come now to spoil his hopes? If Bug\r\nknew he would be first to give it all to his beloved Vic.”\r\n\r\nAnd then came Satan\u0027s ten strike. “No need to settle things now. Wait\r\nand think it over.” And Vic decided in a blind way to think it over.\r\n\r\nIn the rotunda he met Trench, old Trench, slow of step but a lightning\r\ncalculator.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” he exclaimed, as he saw Vic\u0027s face.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027m going to the whirlpool before I\u0027m through,” Vic said, hoarsely.\r\n\r\nTrench caught him in a powerful grip and shoved him to the foot of the\r\nrotunda stairs.\r\n\r\n“No,-you re-not-going-to-the-whirlpool,”\u0027 he said, slowly. “You\u0027re\r\ngoing up to the top of the dome right against that _Ad Astra per Aspera_\r\nbusiness up there, and open the west window and look out at the world\r\nthe Lord made to heal hurt souls by looking at. And you are going to\r\nstay up there until you have fought the thing out with yourself, and\r\ncome down like Moses did with the ten Commandments cut deep on the\r\ntables of your stony old heart. If you don\u0027t, you\u0027ll not need to go to\r\nold Lagonda\u0027s pool. By the holy saints, I\u0027ll take you there myself and\r\nplunge you in just to rid the world of such a fool. You hear me! Now, go\r\non! And remember in your tussle that that big S cut over the old Sunrise\r\ndoor out there stands for Service. That\u0027s what will make your name fit\r\nyou yet, Victor.”\r\n\r\nVic slowly climbed up to where an hour ago the sudden opportunity for\r\nthe fruition of his young life and hope had been brought to him. Lost\r\nnow, unless--Nobody would ever know and Bug could lose nothing. He\r\nopened the west window and looked out at the Walnut Valley, dim and\r\nshadowy now, and the silver prairies beyond it and the gorgeous crimson\r\ntinted sky wherefrom the sun had slipped. And then and there, with his\r\nface to the light, he wrestled with the black Apollyon of his soul. And\r\nevery minute the temptation grew to keep the funds “in trust,” and to\r\nkeep on caring for the boy he had cared for since babyhood. He clinched\r\nhis white teeth and the tiger light was in his eyes again as the longing\r\nfor Elinor\u0027s love overcame him. He pictured her as only one sunset\r\nago she had looked up into his eyes, her face transfigured with love\u0027s\r\nsweetness, and he wished he might keep that picture forever. But,\r\nsomehow, between that face and his own, came the picture of little Bug\r\nalone in the wretched dugout, reaching up baby arms to him for life and\r\nsafety; on his baby face a pleading trustfulness.\r\n\r\nVictor unbuttoned his cuff and slipped up his sleeve to the scar on his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“Anybody can see the scar I put there when I cut out the poison,” he\r\nsaid to himself, at last. “Nobody will see the scar on my soul, but I\u0027ll\r\ncut out the poison just the same. I did not save that baby boy from the\r\nrattlesnakes only to let him be crushed by the serpent in me. Trench was\r\nright, the S over the doorway down there stands for Service as well\r\nas for Sacrifice and Strife. Dr. Fenneben says they all enter into the\r\nwinning of a Master\u0027s Degree. Shall I ever get mine earned, I wonder?”\r\n\r\nHe looked once more at the west, all a soft purple, gray-veiled with\r\nmisty shadows, save over the place where the sun went out one shaft of\r\ndeepest rose hue tipped with golden flame was cleaving its way toward\r\nthe darkening zenith. Then he closed the window and went downstairs and\r\nout into the beautiful December twilight.\r\n\r\nIn all Kansas in that evening hour no man breathed deeper of the sweet,\r\npure air, nor walked with firmer stride, than the man who had gone out\r\nunder the carved symbol of the college doorway, Victor Burleigh of the\r\njunior class at Sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPREMACY\r\n\r\n Make thyself free of Manhood\u0027s guild,\r\n Pull down thy barns and greater build,\r\n Pluck from the sunset\u0027s fruit of gold,\r\n Glean from the heavens and ocean old,\r\n From fireside lone and trampling street\r\n Let thy life garner daily wheat,\r\n The epic of a man rehearse,\r\n Be something better than thy verse,\r\n And thou shalt hear the life-blood flow\r\n From farthest stars to grass-blades low.\r\n                         --LOWELL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. THE MAN BELOW THE SMOKE\r\n\r\n_And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors_.\r\n\r\nELINOR WREAM was standing at the gate as Victor Burleigh came striding\r\nup the street.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going so fast, Victor?” she asked. “Everybody is in a\r\nrush this evening. We had a telegram from the East this afternoon. Uncle\r\nJoshua is very ill, and Uncle Lloyd had to get away on short notice. Old\r\nBond Saxon went by just now, but,” lowering her voice, “he was awfully\r\ndrunk and slipped along like a snake.”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen Bug?” Victor asked. “Dennie says he left a little while\r\nago to find his ball he lost out north this afternoon. He wouldn\u0027t tell\r\nwhere, because he had promised not to.”\r\n\r\n“No, I have not seen him. But don\u0027t be uneasy about Bug. He never plays\r\nnear the river, nor the railroad tracks, and he always comes in at the\r\nright time,” Elinor said, comfortingly.\r\n\r\n“I know he always has before, but I want to find him, anyhow.” The\r\naffectionate tone told Elinor what a loving guardianship was given to\r\nthe unknown orphan child.\r\n\r\n“There was a man here to see Uncle Lloyd just after he left this\r\nevening. The same man that brought a little package for you the night we\r\ncame home. I suppose he comes from your part of the state out West, for\r\nhe seemed to know you and Bug. He asked me if Bug ever played along the\r\nriver and if he was a shy child. He was a strange-looking man, and\r\nI thought he had the cruelest face I ever saw, but I am no expert on\r\nstrange faces.”\r\n\r\nVictor did not wait for another word.\r\n\r\n“I must find Bug right away. You can\u0027t think what he is to me, Elinor,”\r\n and he hurried away.\r\n\r\nAt the bend in the Walnut Vic saw Bug\u0027s little scarlet stocking cap\r\nbeside the flat stone. The twilight was almost gone, but the glistening\r\nriver reflected on the torn bushes above the bank-full stream.\r\n\r\nThe crushing agony of the first minutes made them seem like hours. And\r\nthen the college discipline put in its work. Vic stopped and reasoned.\r\n\r\n“Bug isn\u0027t down there. He never goes near the river. That strange man is\r\nTom Gresh. He killed my father and he\u0027s laid a trap for me. He doesn\u0027t\r\nwant to kill Bug. He wants to keep him to workout vengeance and hate on\r\nme. He says he\u0027ll send me to my father if I go near him. Well, I\u0027m going\r\nso near he\u0027ll not doubt who I am, and I\u0027ll have Bug unharmed if I have\r\nto send Gresh where my father could not go even with water to cool his\r\ntongue. A man may fight with a man as he would fight with a beast to\r\nsave himself or something dearer than himself from beastly destruction,\r\nFenneben says. That\u0027s the battle before me now, and it\u0027s to the death.”\r\n\r\nThe tiger light was in the yellow eyes as never before and the stern jaw\r\nwas set, as Victor Burleigh hurried away. And this was the man who, such\r\na little while ago, was debating with himself over the quiet possession\r\nof Bug Buler\u0027s inheritance. Truly the Mastery comes very near to such as\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nIt was with tiger-like step and instinct, too, that the young man went\r\nleaping up the dark, frost-coated glen. About the mouth of the cave the\r\nblackness was appalling. It seemed a place apart, cursed with the frown\r\nof Nature. Yet in the April time, the sweetest moments of Vic\u0027s young\r\nlife had been spent in this very spot that now showed all the difference\r\nbetween Love and Hate.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the opening of the cavern he guarded his footsteps more\r\ncarefully. The jungle beast was alert within him and the college\r\ntraining was giving way to the might of muscle backed by a will to win.\r\n\r\nA dim light gleamed in the cave and he watched outside now, as Gresh on\r\nthe April day had watched him inside. Down by a wood fire, whose smoke\r\nwas twisting out through a crevice overhead somewhere, little Bug was\r\nsitting on Tom Gresh\u0027s big coat, the fire lighting up his tangle of\r\nred-brown curls. His big brown eyes looking up at the man crouching by\r\nthe fire were eyes of innocent courage, and the expression on the sweet\r\nchild-face was impenetrable.\r\n\r\n“He\u0027s a Burleigh. He\u0027s not afraid,” Vic thought, exultingly. “That\u0027s\r\nhalf my battle. I had it out with the rattlesnakes. I\u0027ll do better\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the outlaw turned toward the door and leaped to his feet\r\nas Vic sprang inside.\r\n\r\nBug started up with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n“Keep out of the way, Bug,” Vic cried, as the two men clinched.\r\n\r\nAnd the struggle began. They were evenly matched, and both had the\r\nsinews of giants. The outlaw had the advantage of an iron strength,\r\nhardened by years of out-door life. But the college that had softened\r\nthe country boy somewhat gave in return the quick judgment and superior\r\nagility of the trained power that counts against weight before the\r\nbattle is over. But withal, it was terrible. One fighter was a murderer\r\nby trade, his hand steady for the blackest deeds, and here was a man he\r\nhad waited long months to destroy. The other fighter was in the struggle\r\nto save a life dear to him, a life that must vindicate his conscience\r\nand preserve his soul\u0027s peace.\r\n\r\nAcross the stone-floored cave they threshed in fury, until at the\r\nfarther wall Gresh flung Vic from him against the jagged rock with a\r\nforce that cut a gash across the boy\u0027s head. The blood splashed on both\r\nmen\u0027s faces as they renewed the strife. Then with a quick twist Burleigh\r\nthrew the outlaw to the floor and held him in a clutch that weighed him\r\ndown like a ledge of rock; and it was pound for pound again.\r\n\r\nAway from the mass of burning coals the blackness was horrible. Beyond\r\nthat fire Bug sat, silent as the stone wall behind him. Gresh gained the\r\nmastery again, and with a grip on Vic\u0027s throat was about to thrust his\r\nhead, face downward, into the burning embers. Vic understood and strove\r\nfor his own life with a maniac\u0027s might, for he knew that one more wrench\r\nwould end the thing.\r\n\r\n“You first, and then the baby; I\u0027ll roast you both,” Gresh hissed, and\r\nVic smelled the heat of the wood flame.\r\n\r\nBut who had counted on Bug? He had watched this fearful grapple,\r\nmotionless and terror-stricken, and now with a child\u0027s vision he saw\r\nwhat Gresh meant to do. Springing up, he caught the heavy coat on which\r\nhe had been sitting and flung it on the fire, smothering the embers and\r\nputting the cavern into complete darkness.\r\n\r\nVic gained the vantage by this unlooked for movement and the grip\r\nshifted. The fighters fell to the floor and then began the same kind of\r\nstruggle by which Burleigh had out-generaled big, unconquerable Trench\r\none day. The two had rolled and fought in college combat from the top\r\nof the limestone ridge to the lower campus and landed with Burleigh\r\ngripping Trench helpless to defend further. That battle was friend with\r\nfriend. This battle was to the death. The blood of both men smeared the\r\nfloor as they tore at each other like wild beasts, and no man could have\r\ntold which oftenest had the vantage hold, nor how the strife would end.\r\nBut it did end soon. The heavy coat, that had smothered the fire and\r\nsaved Vic, smoldered a little, then flared into flame, lighting\r\nthe whole cave, and throwing out black and awful shadows of the two\r\nfighters. They were close to the hole in the inner wall now. Gresh\u0027s\r\nface in that unsteady glare was horrible to see. He loosed his hold a\r\nsecond, then lunged at Vic with the fury of a mad brute. And Vic, who\r\nhad fought the devil in himself to a standstill three hours ago, now\r\ncaught the fiend outside of him for a finishing blow, and the strength\r\nof that last struggle was terrific.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Vic had not spoken.\r\n\r\n“I killed the other snakes. I\u0027ll kill you now,” he growled, as he held\r\nthe outlaw at length in a conquering grip, his knees on Gresh\u0027s breast,\r\nhis right hand on Gresh\u0027s throat.\r\n\r\nIn that weird light the conqueror\u0027s face was only a degree less brutal\r\nthan the outlaw\u0027s face. And Burleigh meant every word, for murder was\r\nin his heart and in his clutching fingers. Beneath the weight of his\r\nstrength Gresh slowly relaxed, struggling fiercely at first and groping\r\nblindly to escape. Then he began to whine for mercy, but his whining\r\nmaddened his conqueror more than his blows had done. For such strife is\r\nno mere wrestling match. Every blow struck against a fellowman is as\r\nthe smell of blood to the tiger, feeding a fiendish eagerness to kill.\r\nBeside, Burleigh had ample cause for vengeance. The creature under his\r\ngrip was not only a bootlegger through whose evil influence men took\r\nother lives or lost their own; he had slain one innocent man, Vic\u0027s own\r\nfather, and in the room where his dead mother lay had robbed Vic\u0027s home\r\nof every valuable thing. He had sworn vengeance on all who bore the\r\nname of Burleigh. What fate might await Bug, Vic dared not picture. One\r\nstrangling grip now could finish the business forever, and his clutch\r\ntightened, as Gresh lay begging like a coward for his own worthless\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“It\u0027s a good thing a fellow has a guardian angel once in a while. We\r\nget pretty close to the edge sometimes and never know how near we are to\r\ndestruction,” Vic had said to Elinor in here on the April day.\r\n\r\nIt was not Vic\u0027s guardian angel, but little Bug whose white face was\r\nthrust between him and his victim, and the touch of a soft little hand\r\nand the pleading child-voice that cried:\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t kill him, Vic. He\u0027s frough of fighting now. Don\u0027t hurt him no\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\nVic staid his hand at the words. The few minutes of this mad-beast duel\r\nhad made him forget the sound of human voices. He half lifted himself\r\nfrom Gresh\u0027s body at Bug\u0027s cry. And Bug, wise beyond his years,\r\nquaint-minded little Bug, said, softly:\r\n\r\n“Fordive us our debts as we fordive our debtors.”\r\n\r\nStrange, loving words of the Man of Galilee, spoken on the mountain-side\r\nlong, long ago, and echoed now by childish lips in the dying light of\r\nthe cavern to these two men, drunk with brute-lust for human blood! For\r\nVic the words struck like blows. All the years since his father\u0027s death\r\nhe had waited for this hour. At last he had met and vanquished the man\r\nwho had taken his father\u0027s life, and now, exultant in his victory, came\r\nthis little child\u0027s voice.\r\n\r\nThe cave darkened. A mist, half blood, half blindness, came before his\r\neyes, but clear to his ears there sounded the ringing words:\r\n\r\n“Vengeance is mine; I will repay!”\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of Discipline calling to his better judgment, as Bug\u0027s\r\ninnocent pleading spoke to the finer man within him.\r\n\r\nUnder his grip Gresh lay motionless, all power of resistance threshed\r\nout of him.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready to quit?” Vic questioned, hoarsely, bending over the\r\nalmost lifeless form.\r\n\r\nThe outlaw mumbled assent.\r\n\r\n“Then I\u0027ll let you live, you miserable wretch, and the courts will take\r\ncare of you.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh himself was faint from strife and loss of blood. As he relaxed\r\nhis vigilance the last atom of strength, the last hope of escape\r\nreturned to Gresh. He sprang to his feet, staggered blindly then, quick\r\nas a panther, he leaped through the hole in the farther wall, wriggled\r\nswiftly into the blind crevices of the inner cave, and was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was Trench who dressed Vic\u0027s head that night and shielded him until\r\nhis strength returned. But it was Bond Saxon who counseled patience.\r\n\r\n“Don\u0027t squeal to the sheriff now,” he urged. “The scoundrel is gone, and\r\nit would make a nine days\u0027 hooray, and nothing would come of it. He was\r\ndarned slick to take the time when Funnybone was away.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Vic asked.\r\n\r\nBut Bond would not tell why. And Vic never dreamed how much cause Bond\r\nSaxon had to dread the day when Tom Gresh should be brought into court,\r\nand his own great crime committed in his drunken hours would demand\r\nretribution. So Lagonda Ledge and Sunrise knew nothing of what had\r\noccurred. Burleigh had no recourse but to wait, while Bug buttoned\r\nup his lips, as he had done for Burgess out at Pigeon Place, and\r\nconveniently “fordot” what he chose not to tell. But he wandered no more\r\nalone about the pretty by-corners of Lagonda Ledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.

To those who loved him most--that is, to all Lagonda\r\nLedge--he was growing handsomer every year, and even with this new\r\nexpression his countenance wore a more kindly grace than ever before.\r\n\r\n“Norrie, your uncle was a strange man,” Fenneben declared, as he and\r\nElinor sat in the library on the evening of his return. “Naturally, I am\r\nunlike my stepbrothers, but I have not even understood them. There\r\nwere many things I learned at Joshua\u0027s bedside that I never knew of the\r\nfamily before. There were some things for you to know, but not now.”\r\n\r\n“I can trust you, Uncle Lloyd, to do just the right thing,” Norrie\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nThe new line of sadness deepened in Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s face.\r\n\r\n“That is a hard thing to do sometimes. Your trust will help me\r\nwonderfully, however,” he replied. “My brother in his last hours made\r\nurgent requests of me and pled with me until I pledged my word to carry\r\nout his wishes. Here\u0027s where I need your trust most.”\r\n\r\nElinor bent over her uncle and softly stroked the heavy black hair from\r\nhis forehead.\r\n\r\n“Here\u0027s where I help you most, then,” she said, gently.\r\n\r\n“I have some funds, Elinor, to be yours at your graduation--not before.\r\nBelieve me, dear girl, I begged of Joshua to let me turn them over to\r\nyou now, but he staid obstinate to the last.”\r\n\r\n“And I don\u0027t want a thing different till I get my diploma. Not even till\r\nI get my Master\u0027s Degree for that matter,” Elinor said, playfully.\r\n\r\n“And meantime, Norrie, will you just be a college girl and drop all\r\nthought of this marrying business until you are through school?”\r\n Fenneben was hesitating a little now. “A year hence will be time enough\r\nfor that.”\r\n\r\n“Most gladly,” Elinor assured him.\r\n\r\n“Then that\u0027s all for my brother\u0027s sake. Now for mine, Norrie, or for\r\nyours, rather, if my little girl has her mind all set about things after\r\nschool days, I hope she will not be a flirt. Sometimes the words and\r\nacts cut deeper into other lives than we ever dream. Norrie, I know this\r\nout of the years of my own lonely life.”\r\n\r\nElinor\u0027s eyes were dewy with tears and she bent her head until her hair\r\ntouched his cheek.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll try to be good \u0027fornever,\u0027 as Bug Buler says,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver in the Saxon House on this same evening Vincent Burgess had come in\r\nto see Dennie about some books.\r\n\r\n“I took your advice, Dennie,” he said. “I have been a man to the extent\r\nof making myself square with Victor Burleigh, and I\u0027ve felt like a free\r\nman ever since.”\r\n\r\nThe look of joy and pride in Dennie\u0027s eyes thrilled him with a keen\r\npleasure. Her eyes were of such a soft gray and her pretty wavy hair was\r\nso lustrous tonight.\r\n\r\n“Dennie, I am going to be even more of a man than you asked me to be.”\r\n\r\nDennie did not look up. The pink of her cheek, her long lashes over\r\nher downcast eyes, the sunny curls above her forehead, all were fair to\r\nVincent Burgess. As he looked at her he began to understand, blind bat\r\nthat he had been all this time, he, Professor Vincent Burgess, A.B.,\r\nInstructor in Greek from Harvard University.\r\n\r\n“I must be going now. Good-night, Dennie.”\r\n\r\nHe shook hands and hurried away, but to the girl who was earning her\r\ncollege education there was something in his handclasp, denied before.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was a settling of affairs at Sunrise, and the\r\ncharacter-building put into Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s hand, as clay for the\r\npotter\u0027s wheel, seemed to him to be shaping somewhat to its destined\r\nuses.\r\n\r\nAgain, Vincent Burgess sat in the chair by the west study window,\r\nacting-dean, now seeking neither types, nor geographical breadth, nor\r\nseclusion amid barren prairie lands for profound research in preparing\r\nfor a Master\u0027s Degree.\r\n\r\nWith no effort to conceal matters, except the fact that the trust funds\r\nhad first belonged to his own sister and brother-in-law, he explained to\r\nFenneben the line of events connecting him with Victor Burleigh.\r\n\r\n“And, Dr. Fenneben, I must speak of a matter I have never touched upon\r\nwith you before. It was agreed between Dr. Wream and myself that I\r\nshould become his nephew by marriage. I want to go to Miss Elinor\r\nand ask her to release me. You will pardon my frankness, for I cannot\r\nhonorably continue in this relationship since I have restored the\r\nproperty to Victor Burleigh.”\r\n\r\n“He thinks she will not care for him now,” Fenneben said to himself.\r\nAloud he said:\r\n\r\n“Have you ever spoken directly to Elinor on this matter?”\r\n\r\n“N-no. It was an understanding between her and her uncle and between him\r\nand me,” Burgess replied.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don\u0027t pretend to know girls very well, being a confirmed\r\nbachelor”--the Dean\u0027s eyes were smiling--“but my advice at this distance\r\nis not to ask Norrie to release you from what she herself has never yet\r\nbound you. I\u0027ll vouch for her peace of mind; and your sense of honor is\r\nfully vindicated now. To be equally frank with you, Burgess, now that\r\nNorrie is entirely in my charge, I have put this sort of thing for\r\nher absolutely into the after-commencement years. The best wife is not\r\nalways the girl who wears a diamond ring through three or four years\r\nof her college life. I want my niece to be a girl now, not a\r\nbride-in-waiting.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Burgess rose to go his eye caught sight of the pigeons above the bend\r\nin the river.\r\n\r\n“By the way, Doctor, have you ever found out anything about the woman\r\nwho used to live in that deserted place up north?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing yet,” Fenneben replied. “But, remember, I have not spent a\r\nweek--that is, a sane week--in Lagonda Ledge since the night you, and\r\nshe, and Saxon, and the dog saved my life. I shall take up her case\r\nsoon.”\r\n\r\n“She is gone away and nobody knows where, Saxon tells me,” Burgess said.\r\n“For many reasons I wish we could find her, but she has dropped out of\r\nsight.”\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben wondered at the sorrowful expression on the younger man\u0027s\r\nface when he said this.\r\n\r\nAs he left the study Victor Burleigh came in.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Burleigh. What can I do for you?” Fenneben asked.\r\n\r\nSomething like his own magnetism of presence was in the young man before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you something,” Vic responded.\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you something. I knew you had good blood in your veins even\r\nwhen I saw you kill that bull snake. Burgess has just been in. He has\r\ntold me his side of your story. Noble fellow he is to free himself of a\r\nlife-long slavery to somebody else\u0027s dollars. However much a man may try\r\nto hide the fetters of unlawful gains, they clank in his own ears till\r\nhe hates himself. Now Burgess is a freeman.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear you say so, Dr. Fenneben. It makes my own freedom\r\nsweeter,” Vic declared.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Fenneben replied. “Your added means will bring you life\u0027s best\r\ngift--opportunity.”\r\n\r\n“I have no added means, Doctor. I have funds in trust for Bug Buler, and\r\nI come to ask you to take his legal guardianship for me.” And then he\r\ntold his own life story.\r\n\r\n“So the heroism shifts to you as well. I can picture the cost to a man\r\nlike yourself,” the Dean said. “Have you no record of Bug\u0027s father and\r\nmother?”\r\n\r\n“None but the record given by Dr. Wream. They are dead,” Burleigh\r\nreplied. “His father may have met the same fate that my father did.”\r\n\r\n“Why don\u0027t you take the guardianship yourself, Burleigh? The boy is\r\nyours in love and blood. He ought to be in law.”\r\n\r\nVictor Burleigh stood up to his full height, a magnificent product of\r\nNature\u0027s handiwork. But the mind and soul “Dean Funnybone” had helped to\r\nshape.\r\n\r\n“I will be honest with you, Dr. Fenneben,” Burleigh said, and his voice\r\nwas deep and sweetly resonant. “If I keep the money in charge I may not\r\nbe proof against the temptation to use it for myself. As strong as my\r\nstrong arms are my hates and loves, and for some reasons I would do\r\nalmost anything to gain riches. I might not resist the tempter.”\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben\u0027s black eyes blazed at the words.\r\n\r\n“I understand perfectly what you mean, but no woman who exacts this\r\nprice is worth the cost.” Then, in a gentler tone, he continued:\r\n“Burleigh, will you take my advice? I have always had your welfare on\r\nmy heart. Finish your college work first. Get the best of the classroom,\r\nthe library, the athletic field, and the \u0027picnic spread.\u0027 Is that the\r\nright term? But fit yourself for manhood before you undertake a man\u0027s\r\nduties. Meantime, He who has given you the mastery in the years behind\r\nyou is leading you toward the larger places before you, teaching you all\r\nthe meanings of Strife, and Sacrifice, and Service symbolized above our\r\ndoorway in our proud College initial letter. The Supremacy is yet to\r\ncome. Will you follow my counsel? I\u0027ll take care of Bug, and we will\r\nkeep Burgess out of this for a while.”\r\n\r\nBurleigh thought he understood, and the silent hand clasp pledged the\r\nfaith of the country boy to the teacher\u0027s wishes.\r\n\r\nIt is only in story books that events leap out as pages are turned,\r\nevents that take days on days of real life to compass. In the swing of\r\none brief year Lagonda Ledge knew little change. New cement walks were\r\nbuilt south almost to the Kickapoo Corral. A new manufacturing concern\r\nhad bonds voted for it at an exciting election, and a squabble for a\r\nsuitable site was in process. Vincent Burgess and Victor Burleigh, two\r\nstrong men, were growing actually chummy, and Trench declared he was\r\nglad they had decided to quit playing marbles for keeps and hiding each\r\nother\u0027s caps.\r\n\r\nAnd now the springtime of the year was on the beautiful Walnut Valley.\r\nElinor and Dennie, Trench, “Limpy,” the crippled student, and Victor\r\nBurleigh were all on the home-stretch of their senior year. One more\r\nJune Commencement day and Sunrise would know them no more. Beyond\r\nall this there was nothing new at Lagonda Ledge until suddenly the\r\nwhite-haired woman was up at Pigeon Place, again, a fact known only to\r\nold Bond Saxon and little Bug, who saw her leave the train. The little\r\nblue smoke-twist was again rising lazily in the warm May air, and\r\nsomebody was systematically robbing houses in town, and Bond Saxon was\r\noften drunk and hiding away from sight. A May storm sent the Walnut\r\nbooming down the valley, bank full, cutting off traffic at the town\r\nbridge, but the days that followed were a joy. A tenderly green world it\r\nwas now, all blossom-decked, and blown across by the gentle May zephyrs,\r\nwith nothing harsh nor cruel in it, unless the rushing river down below\r\nthe shallows might seem so. The Kickapoo Corral, luxuriant with flowers,\r\nand springing grass, and May green foliage, told nothing of the old-time\r\nsiege and sorrow of Swift Elk and the Fawn of the Morning Light.\r\n\r\nOn the night after the storm Professor Burgess stopped at the Saxon\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n“Where is your father, Dennie?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He went up north to help somebody out of the mud and water, I suppose,”\r\n Dennie replied. “He is the kindest neighbor, and he has been trying\r\nto--to keep straight. He told me when he left that this night\u0027s work was\r\nto be a work of redemption for him. He may get stronger some time.”\r\n\r\nIn his heart Burgess knew better. He had no faith in the old man\u0027s will\r\npower, and the burden of a hidden crime he knew would but increase its\r\nweight with time, and drag Bond down at last. But Dennie need not suffer\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“Will you go with me down to the old Corral tomorrow afternoon, Dennie?\r\nI want some plants that grow there. I\u0027m studying nature along with\r\nGreek,” he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Of course, if it is fair,” Dennie replied, the pretty color blooming\r\ndeeper in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we go fair or foul. You remember we fought it out coming home from\r\nthere once.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bond Saxon was hurrying north on his work of redemption. At\r\nthe bend in the river he found Tom Gresh sitting on the flat stone slab.\r\nThe light was gleaming through the shrubbery of the little cottage, and\r\nthe homey sounds of evening and the twitter of late-coming birds were in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n“What are you here for, Gresh?” Bond asked, hoarsely. “I thought you had\r\nleft for good.”\r\n\r\nThe villainous-looking outlaw drew a flask from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Have a drink, Saxon. Take the whole bottle,” and he thrust it into the\r\nold man\u0027s hands.\r\n\r\nBond wavered a moment, then flung it far into the foamy floods of the\r\nWalnut.\r\n\r\n“Not any more. You shall not get me drunk again while you rob and kill.”\r\n\r\n“You did the killing for me once. Won\u0027t you do it again?” Gresh snarled.\r\n\r\nBond clinched his fists but did not strike.\r\n\r\n“What are you after now?” he asked. “You are through with the Burleighs;\r\nVic settled you and you know it.”\r\n\r\nEven with the words the clutch of Vic\u0027s fingers on the outlaw\u0027s throat\r\nseemed to choke him now.\r\n\r\n“If my last Burleigh is gone,” he growled with an oath, “I\u0027m not done\r\nyet. There\u0027s Elinor Wream. Don\u0027t forget that her mother was my adopted\r\nsister. Don\u0027t forget that my old foster father cut me off without a\r\ncent and gave her all his money. That\u0027s why Nathan Wream married her.\r\nHe wanted her money for colleges.” The sneer on the man\u0027s face was\r\ndiabolical. “I can hit the old man through Elinor, and I\u0027ll do it some\r\ntime, and that\u0027s not the only blow that I can strike here, and I am\r\ngoing to finish this thing now.” He pointed toward the cottage where the\r\nunprotected woman sat alone. “Twice I\u0027ve nerved myself to do it and been\r\nfooled each time. One October day you were here drunk. I could have laid\r\nit on you easy, and maybe fixed Fenneben too, if a little child\u0027s\r\nvoice hadn\u0027t scared me stiff. And the day of the big football game you\r\nwouldn\u0027t get drunk and she must go down to that game just to look once\r\nat Lloyd Fenneben. I meant to finish her that day. This is the third and\r\nlast time now. There is not even a dog to protect her.”\r\n\r\nBond Saxon had been a huge fellow in his best days, and now he summoned\r\nall the powers nature had left to him.\r\n\r\n“Tom Gresh,” he cried, “in my infernal weakness you made me a drunken\r\nbeast, who took the life of an innocent man you wanted out of your way.\r\nYou thought, you fool, that she might care for you then. I\u0027ve carried\r\nthe curse of that deed on my soul night and day. I\u0027ll wipe it partly\r\naway now by saving her life from you. So surely as tonight, tomorrow,\r\nor ever you try to harm her, I\u0027ll not show you the mercy Vic Burleigh\r\nshowed you once.”\r\n\r\nStrange forms the guardian angel takes!\r\n\r\nHence we entertain it unawares.\r\n\r\nOf all Lagonda Ledge, old Bond Saxon, standing between a woman and the\r\nperil of her life, looked least angelic. Gresh understood him and turned\r\nfirst in fawning and tempting trickery to his adversary. But Saxon stood\r\nhis ground. Then the outlaw raged in fury, not daring to strike now,\r\nbecause he knew Bond\u0027s strength. And still the old man was unmoved. A\r\nlife saved for the life he had taken was steeling his soul to courage.\r\n\r\nAt last in the dim light, Gresh stood motionless a minute, then he\r\nstruck his parting blow.\r\n\r\n“All right, Bond Saxon, play protector all you want to, but it\u0027s a short\r\ngame for you. The sheriff is out of town tonight, but tomorrow afternoon\r\nhe will get back to Lagonda Ledge. Tomorrow afternoon I go with all my\r\nproofs--Oh, I\u0027ve got \u0027em. And you, Bond Saxon, will be behind the bars\r\nfor your crime, done not so many years ago, and your honorable daughter,\r\ndisgraced forever by you, can shift for herself. I\u0027ve nothing to lose;\r\nwhy should I protect you?”\r\n\r\nHe leaped down the bank into the swiftly flowing river, and, swimming\r\neasily to the farther side, he disappeared in the underbrush.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, somebody remembered that Bond Saxon had crossed the\r\nbridge and plunged into the overflow of the river around the west end.\r\nBut Bond had been drunk much of late and nobody approached him when he\r\nwas drunk. How could Lagonda Ledge know the agony of the old man\u0027s soul\r\nas he splashed across the Walnut waters and floundered up the narrow\r\nglen to the cave? Or how, for Dennie\u0027s sake, he had begged on his knees\r\nfor mercy that should save his daughter\u0027s name? Or how harder than the\r\nstone of the ledges, that the trickling water through slow-dragging\r\ncenturies has worn away, was the stony heart of the creature who denied\r\nhim? And only Victor Burleigh had power to picture the struggle that\r\nmust have followed in that cavern, and beyond the wall into the blind\r\nblack passages leading at last to the bluff above the river, where,\r\nclinched in deadly combat, the two men, fighting still, fell headlong\r\ninto the Walnut floods.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown at the shallows Professor Burgess and Dennie had found the waters\r\ntoo deep to reach the Kickapoo Corral, so they strolled along the\r\nbluff watching the river rippling merrily in the fall of the afternoon\r\nsunshine. And brightly, too, the sunshine fell on Dennie Saxon\u0027s\r\nrippling hair, recalling to Vincent Burgess\u0027 memory the woodland camp\r\nfire and the old legend told in the October twilight and the flickering\r\nflames lighting Dennie\u0027s face and the wavy folds of her sunny hair.\r\n\r\nBut even as he remembered, a cry up stream came faintly, once and no\r\nmore, while, grappling still, two forms were borne down by the swift\r\ncurrent to the bend above the whirlpool. Dennie and Vincent sprang to\r\nthe very edge of the bluff, powerless to save, as Tom Gresh and Bond\r\nSaxon were swept around the curve below the Corral. Across the shallows\r\nthey struggled for a footing, but the undertow carried them on toward\r\nthe fatal pool.\r\n\r\nA shriek from the bank came to Bond Saxon\u0027s ears, and he looked up and\r\nsaw the two reaching out vain hands to him.\r\n\r\n“Your oath, Vincent; your oath!” he cried in agonizing tones.\r\n\r\nThen Vincent Burgess put one arm about Dennie Saxon and drew her close\r\nto him and lifted up his right hand high above him in token to the\r\ndrowning man of his promise, under heaven, to keep that oath forever.\r\n\r\nA look of joy swept over the old face in the water, his struggling\r\nceased, and once more tribute was paid to the grim Chieftain of\r\nLagonda\u0027s Pool.--------\r\n\r\nThey said about town the next day that it was the peacefulest face\r\never seen below a coffin lid. And, remembering only his many acts of\r\nneighborly kindness, they forgave and forgot his weaknesses, while\r\nto the few who knew his life-tragedy came the assuring hope that\r\nthe forgiving mercy of man is but a type of the boundless mercy of a\r\nforgiving God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. THE MASTERY\r\n\r\n _And only the Master shall praise us, and only the\r\n     Master shall blame,\r\n And no one shall work for money, and no one\r\n     shall work for fame,\r\n But each for the joy of working, and each, in his\r\n     separate star,\r\n Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of\r\n     Things as They Are_.\r\n                    --KIPLING\r\n\r\nJUNE time in the Walnut Valley, and commencement time at Sunrise on the\r\nlimestone ridge! Nor pen nor brush can show the glory of the radiant\r\nprairies, and the deep blue of the “unscarred heavens,” and the bright\r\ngleams from rippling waters. And at the end of a perfect day comes the\r\nsilvery grandeur of a moonlit June night.\r\n\r\nIt was late afternoon of the day before commencement. Victor Burleigh\r\nstood on the stone where four years ago the bull snake had stretched\r\nitself in the lazy sunshine. Only one more day at Sunrise for him, and\r\nthe little heartache, unlike any other sorrow a life can ever know,\r\nwas his, as he stood there. In the four years\u0027 battle he had come off\r\nconqueror until the symbol above the doorway no longer held any mystery\r\nfor him. His character and culture now matched his voice. Before him\r\nwas higher learning, an under-professorship at Harvard, and later on the\r\npulpit for his life work. But now the heartache of parting was his, and\r\na deeper pain than breaking school ties was his also. A year of jolly\r\ngoodfellowship was ending, a happy year, with Elinor his most frequent\r\ncompanion. And often in this year he had wondered at Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s\r\nharsh judgment of her. Fondness of luxury seemed foreign to her, and\r\nwomanly beauty of character made her always “Norrie the beloved.” But\r\nVictor was true to Fenneben\u0027s demands and willing to try to live through\r\nthe years after, if one year of happy association could be his now.\r\nWhatever claims Burgess might assert later, he could not take from\r\nanother the claim to happy memories. But, today, there was the dull\r\nsteady heartache that he knew had come to stay.\r\n\r\nPresently Elinor joined him.\r\n\r\n“May I come down tonight for a goodby stroll, Elinor? There\u0027s a full\r\nmoon and after tomorrow there are to be no more moons, nor stars, nor\r\nsuns, nor lands, nor seas, nor principalities, nor powers for us at\r\nSunrise.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would come, Victor,” Elinor said. “Come early. There\u0027s\r\na crowd going out somewhere, and we can join the ranks of the great\r\nungraduated for the last time.”\r\n\r\n“Elinor, I\u0027m not hunting a crowd tonight,” Vic said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Well, come, anyway, and we\u0027ll hunt the solitude, if we can\u0027t hunt any\r\nother game.” And they strolled homeward together.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early evening Lloyd Fenneben and Elinor sat on the veranda\r\nwatching the sunset through the trees beyond the river.\r\n\r\n“You are to graduate from Sunrise tomorrow,” Dr. Fenneben was saying.\r\n“For a Wream that is the real beginning of life. I have your business\r\nmatters entrusted to me, ready to close up as soon as you are \u0027legally\r\ngraduated\u0027 according to my brother\u0027s wishes, but you may as well know\r\nthem now.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and Elinor, thinking of the moonlight, maybe, waited in\r\npeaceful silence.\r\n\r\n“Norrie, when I finished at the university my brother put a small\r\nfortune into my hands and bade me go West and build a new Harvard. You\r\nknow our family hold that that is the only legitimate use for money.”\r\n\r\nNorrie smiled assent.\r\n\r\n“I did not ask whose money it was, for my brother handled many bequests,\r\nand I was a poor business man then. I came and invested it at last\r\nin Sunrise-by-the-Walnut. That was your mother\u0027s money, given by your\r\nfather to Joshua, who gave it to me. Joshua did not tell me, and I\r\nsupposed some good, old Boston philanthropist had bought an indulgence\r\nfor his ignorant soul by endowing this thing so freely. I found it out\r\non Joshua\u0027s deathbed, and only to pacify him would I consent to keep it\r\nuntil now. Henceforth, it must be yours. That is why I asked you a year\r\nago to just be a college girl and drop all thought about marrying. I\r\nwanted you to come into possession of your own property before you bound\r\nyourself by any bonds you could not break.”\r\n\r\nElinor sat silent for a while, her dark eyes seeing only the low golden\r\nsunset. She understood now what had grooved that line of care in Lloyd\r\nFenneben\u0027s face when he came home from the East. But he had conquered,\r\naye, he had won the mastery.\r\n\r\n“And you and Sunrise?” she asked at length.\r\n\r\n“I can sell the college site and buildings to this new manufactory\r\ncoming here in August. Added to this, I have acquired sufficient funds\r\nof my own to pay you the entire amount and a good rate of interest with\r\nit. My grief is that for all these years, I have kept you out of your\r\nown.”\r\n\r\nElinor rose up, white and cold, and put her hand on her uncle\u0027s hand.\r\n\r\n“Let me think a little, Uncle Lloyd. It is not easy to realize one\u0027s\r\nfortune in a minute.” Then she left him.\r\n\r\n“It makes little difference what passion possesses a man\u0027s soul, if it\r\npossesses him he will wrong his fellowmen,” Fenneben said to himself.\r\n“In Joshua Wream\u0027s craving to endow college claims he robbed this girl\r\nof her inheritance and sent her to me, telling me she was shallow-minded\r\nand wholly given to a love of luxuries, that I might not see his plans;\r\nwhile Norrie, never knowing, has proved over and over how false these\r\ncharges were. And at last, to still his noisy conscience, he would marry\r\nher, willing or unwilling, to Vincent Burgess. But with all this, his\r\nlast hours were full of sorrowful confession. What do these Masters\u0027\r\nDegrees my brother bore avail a man if he have not the mastery within?\r\nMeanwhile, my labors here must end.”\r\n\r\nLonely and crushed, with his life work taken from him, he sat and faced\r\nthe sunset. Presently, he saw Elinor and Victor Burleigh strolling away\r\nin the soft evening light. At the corner, Elinor turned and waved a\r\ngood-by to him. Then the memory of his own commencement day came back\r\nto him, and of the happy night before. Oh, that night before! Can a man\r\never forget! And now, tonight!\r\n\r\n“Don Fonnybone,” Bug Buler piped, as he came trudging around the corner.\r\n“I want to confessing.”\r\n\r\nHe came to Fenneben\u0027s side and looked up confidently in his face.\r\n\r\n“Well, confessing. I\u0027ve just finished doing that myself,” Fenneben said.\r\n\r\n“I did a bad, long ago. I want to go and confessing. Will you go with\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Where shall we go to be shriven, Bug?\r\n\r\n“To Pigeon Place,” Bug responded. “The Pigeon woman is there now. I saw\r\nher coming, and I must go right away and confessing.”\r\n\r\n“I\u0027ll go with you, Bug. I want to see that woman, anyhow,” Fenneben\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAnd the two went away in the early twilight of this rare June evening.\r\n\r\nOut at Pigeon Place, when Dr. Fenneben and little Bug walked up the\r\ngrassy way to the vine-covered porch in the misty twilight, Mrs. Marian\r\nsat in the shadow, unaware of their coming until they stood before her.\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben lifted his hat, and little Bug imitated him.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, Mrs. Marian. This little boy wanted to tell you of\r\nsomething that was troubling him. I think he trespassed on your property\r\nunknowingly.”\r\n\r\nThe gray-haired woman stood motionless in the shadow still. Her fair\r\nface less haggard than of yore, as if some dread had left it, and only\r\nloneliness remained.\r\n\r\n“I was here, and you was away, and I peeked in the window. It was\r\nrude and I never did see you to tell you, and I\u0027m sorry and I won\u0027t\r\nfor--never do it again. Dennie told me to come tonight, and bring Don\r\nFonnybone.” Bug had his part well in hand.\r\n\r\nEven as she smiled at him, Dr. Fenneben noticed how her hand on the\r\nlattice shook.\r\n\r\n“And I want to thank you, Mrs. Marian, for your bravery and goodness on\r\nthe night I was assaulted here.” Fenneben was a gentleman to the core\r\nand his courtesy was charming. “I meant to find you long ago, but my\r\nbrother\u0027s death, with my own long illness, and your absence, and my many\r\nduties--” He paused with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lloyd, Lloyd, on an evening like this, why do you come here?”\r\n\r\nThe woman stood in the light now, a tragic figure of sorrow. And she was\r\nnot yet forty.\r\n\r\nDr. Fenneben caught his breath and the light seemed to go out before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Marian, oh, Marian! After all these years, do I find you here? They\r\nsaid you were dead.” He caught her in his arms and held her close to his\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Lots of folks spoons round the Saxon House, so I went away and lef\r\n\u0027em,” Bug explained to Vic once afterward.\r\n\r\nAnd that accounted for little Bug sitting lonely on the flat stone by\r\nthe bend in the river where Dennie and Burgess found him later.\r\n\r\n“So you have stood between me and that assassin all these years,\r\neven when the lies against me made you doubt my love. Oh, Marian, the\r\nstrength of a woman\u0027s heart!” Fenneben declared, as, side by side, black\r\nhair and the gray near together, these long-separated lovers rebuilt\r\ntheir world.\r\n\r\n“And this little child brought you here at last. \u0027A little child shall\r\nlead them,\u0027” the woman murmured.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Bug is a gift of God.” Lloyd Fenneben was bending over her. “He is\r\nVictor Burleigh\u0027s nephew, who found him in a deserted place--”\r\n\r\nA shriek cut the evening air and she who had been known as Mrs. Marian\r\nlay in a faint at Fenneben\u0027s feet.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Marian, what this means.”\r\n\r\nLloyd Fenneben had restored her to consciousness and she was resting,\r\nwhite and trembling, in his arms.\r\n\r\n“My little Bug, my baby, Burgess!” she sobbed. “Bond Saxon, in a drunken\r\nfit, killed his father. Then Tom Gresh carried him away to save him from\r\nBond, too, so Tom declared, but I did not believe him. Bond never harmed\r\na little child. Tom said he meant no harm and that Bug was stolen from\r\nwhere he had left him. It was then that my hair turned white. Tom tried\r\nonce, a year ago in December, to make me believe he could bring Bug back\r\nto me if I would care for him--for that wicked murderer! Oh, Lloyd!”\r\n\r\nShe nestled close in Dr. Fenneben\u0027s protecting arms, and shivered at the\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n“And you named him Burgess for your own name. Does Vincent know?”\r\n Fenneben questioned, tenderly smoothing the white hair as Norrie had so\r\noften smoothed his own.\r\n\r\n“Is this Vincent my own brother? Will he really own me as his sister?\r\nI\u0027ve tried to meet him many times. I left his picture on my table that\r\nhe might see it if he should ever come. My father separated us years\r\nago. After we came West he sent me just one letter in which he said\r\nVincent would never speak to me nor claim me as his sister again. A\r\nbrother--a lover--and my baby boy!”\r\n\r\nAnd the lonely woman, overcome with joy, sat white and still beneath the\r\nwhite moonbeams.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoy does not kill any more than sorrow. Vincent Burgess and Dennie\r\nSaxon, who came just at the right time, told how they had waited with\r\nBug at the slab of stone by the bend in the river until they should be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n“It was Dennie who planned it all,” Vincent said, “and did not even let\r\nme know. Bug told her my picture was on the table in there. But so long\r\nas her father lived, she kept her counsel.”\r\n\r\n“I tried four years ago to get Dr. Fenneben to come out here,” Dennie\r\nsaid. And the Dean remembered the autumn holiday and Dennie\u0027s solicitude\r\nfor an unknown woman.\r\n\r\nBut the joy of this night, crowning all other joys in the Walnut Valley,\r\nwas in that sacred moment when Bug Buler walked slowly up to Marian\r\nBurleigh, sister to Vincent Burgess, lost love of Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s\r\nyouth--slowly, and with big brown eyes glowing with a strange new love\r\nlight, and, putting up both his chubby hands to her cheeks, he murmured\r\nsoftly:\r\n\r\n“Is you my own mother? Then, I\u0027ll love you fornever.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, on this last moonlit June night, Elinor and Vic were strolling\r\ndown the new south cement walk, a favorite place for the young people\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nAt the farther end, Vic said:\r\n\r\n“Norrie, let\u0027s go down across the shallows to the west bluff again. Can\r\nyou climb it, or shall we join the crowd down in the Kickapoo Corral?”\r\n\r\n“I can climb where you can, Victor,” Elinor declared.\r\n\r\n“Dennie will never want to come here again. Poor Dennie!”\r\n\r\nVic was helping Elinor across the shallows as he spoke. Up in the Corral\r\na happy crowd of young people were finishing their last “picnic spread”\r\n for the year. Below the shallows the whirlpool was glistening all\r\ntreacherously smooth and level under the moonbeams.\r\n\r\n“Why \u0027poor Dennie,\u0027 Victor? Her father had nothing more for him, here,\r\nexcept disgrace. The tribute paid him at his funeral would have been\r\nforever withheld, if he had lived a day longer, and he died sure of\r\nDennie\u0027s future.” Elinor spoke gently.\r\n\r\n“Who told you all this, Elinor?” Victor asked.\r\n\r\n“Professor Burgess, when he showed me the diamond ring Dennie is to wear\r\ntomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Dennie, a diamond! I\u0027m glad for Dennie. Diamonds are fine to have,” Vic\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nThey had climbed to the top of the west bluff. The silvery prairie and\r\nsilver river and mist-wreathed valley, and overhead, the clear, calm\r\nsky, where the moon sailed in magnificent grandeur, were a setting to\r\nmake the evening a perfect one. And in this setting was Elinor, herself\r\nthe jewel, beautiful, winsome, womanly.\r\n\r\n“I have some good news.” She turned to the young man beside her. “You\r\nknow the Wreams have made a life business of endowing colleges. Well,\r\nI am a Wream by blood, and tomorrow, oh, Victor, tomorrow, I, too, have\r\nthe opportunity of a lifetime. I\u0027m going to endow Sunrise.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it\u0027s clear enough,” she exclaimed. “It was my money that built\r\nSunrise. It shall stay here, and Dr. Lloyd Fenneben, Dean of Sunrise,\r\nand acting-Dean Vincent Burgess, A.B., Professor of Greek, and Victor\r\nBurleigh, Valedictorian, who goes East to a professorship in Harvard,\r\nand to the ministry of the gospel later on--all you mighty men of valor\r\nwill know how little Norrie Wream cares for money, except as it can make\r\nthe world better and happier. I haven\u0027t lived in Lloyd Fenneben\u0027s home\r\nthese four years without learning something of what is required for a\r\nMaster\u0027s Degree.”\r\n\r\n“Norrie!” All the music of a soul poured into the music of the deep\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“Victor! There is no sacrifice in it. I wish there were, that I might\r\nwear the honors you wear so modestly.”\r\n\r\n“I, Elinor?”\r\n\r\n“I know the whole story. Dennie told me when you had that awful fight,\r\nand Trenchie told me long ago, that you thought I must have money to\r\nmake me happy. Why I, more than Dennie, or you, who gave Bug his claim?”\r\n\r\nElinor put up her hands to Victor, who took them both in his, as he drew\r\nher to him and kissed her sweet red lips. And there was a new heaven\r\nand a new earth created that night in the soft silvery moonlight of the\r\nWalnut Valley.\r\n\r\n“I\u0027d rather be here with you than over the river with anybody else. I\r\nfeel safer here,” she murmured, remembering when they had striven in the\r\ndarkness and the storm to reach this very height.\r\n\r\nBut Victor Burleigh could not speak. The mastery for which he had\r\nstriven seemed to bring meed of reward too great for him to grasp with\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARTING\r\n\r\n ... _There is neither East nor West, Border,\r\n     nor Breed, nor Birth,\r\n When two strong men stand face to face, tho\u0027 they\r\n     come from the ends of the earth!_\r\n                         --KIPLING\r\n\r\nCOMMENCEMENT day at Sunrise was just one golden Kansas June day, when\r\n\r\nThe heart is so full that a drop overfills it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVictor Burleigh, late of a claim out beyond the Walnut, Professor-to-be\r\nin Harvard University, and Vincent Burgess, acting-Dean of Sunrise, only\r\na degree less beloved than Dean Fenneben himself, met on the morning of\r\ncommencement day at the campus gate, one to go to the East, the other\r\nto stay in the West. Side by side they walked up the long avenue to\r\nthe foot of the slope, together they climbed the broad flight of steps\r\nleading up to the imposing doorway of Sunrise with the big letter S\r\ncarved in relief above it. And after pausing a moment to take in the\r\nmatchless wonder of the landscape over which old Sunrise keeps watch,\r\nthe college portal swung open and the two entered at the same time.\r\nInside the doorway, under the halo of light from the stained glass dome\r\nwith its Kansas motto, wrought in dainty coloring. Elinor Wream, niece\r\nof the Dean of Sunrise, and Dennie Saxon, old Bond Saxon\u0027s daughter, who\r\nhad earned her college tuition, stood side by side, awaiting them. And\r\nbeyond these, on the rotunda stairs, Dr. Lloyd Fenneben was looking down\r\nat the four with keen black eyes. Beside him on the broad stairway was\r\nMarian Burgess Burleigh, the white-haired, young-faced woman of Pigeon\r\nPlace, and Bug Buler--everybody\u0027s child.\r\n\r\nThe barriers were down at last: the value of common life, the power of\r\nStrife and Sacrifice and Service, the joy of Supremacy, the conflict of\r\nrich red blood with the thinner blue, the force of culture against mere\r\nphysical strength, the power of character over wealth--these things had\r\nbeen wrought out under the gracious influence of Dr. Lloyd Fenneben in\r\nSunrise-by-the-Walnut.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Come up, come up; there is room up here,” the Dean called to the group\r\nin the rotunda. “There\u0027s an A.B. for all who have conquered the Course\r\nof Study, and a Master\u0027s Degree for everyone who has conquered himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common level so impossible on a September day four years ago, came\r\nnow to two strong men when the commencement exercises were ended, and\r\nSunrise became to the outgoing class only a hallowed memory.\r\n\r\nThe hour is high noon, the good-bys are given, and from the crest of the\r\nlimestone ridge the ringing chorus, led by good old Trench, sounds far\r\nand far away along the Walnut Valley:\r\n\r\n Rah for Funnybone!\r\n Rah for Funnybone!\r\n Rah for Funnybone!\r\n _Rah!_ RAW RAH!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\u0027s A Master\u0027s Degree, by Margaret Hill McCarter"
