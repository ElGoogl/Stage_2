Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

The \"Forty-Five\" itself would have provided enough\r\nmaterial to fill a volume of double the size. I have therefore\r\nconcentrated on the four events which seemed to me most\r\nimportant--namely, the Darien scheme, the Union of the Crowns, and the\r\nrisings of 1715 and 1745. For the rest, I have endeavoured to\r\nillustrate, however briefly, the religious, social, and industrial\r\nactivities of the time.

(London and Edinburgh: 1771.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf those who had offered their services to William for the settlement of\r\nScotland, three were eminent above the rest: the Duke of Hamilton, the\r\nMarquis of Athole, and Lord Stair. The Duke of Hamilton had disapproved\r\nof the measures of the late reign, but without publicly opposing them.\r\nHe had observed the same cautious conduct with regard to the parties of\r\nhis countrymen. He took advantage of his rank to attend none of those\r\npublic cabals in which all party-measures had been conducted in\r\nScotland, from the time of the tables of the covenant; and, by that\r\nsingularity, appeared to be of no party, at the same time when he was\r\ndealing in private with all parties. Son of the illustrious house of\r\nDouglas, married to the heiress of the house of Hamilton, related to the\r\nroyal family, and to most of the crowned heads of Europe, in succession\r\nin right of his wife to the crown of Scotland, at a time when the\r\nancient families of Scotland were of importance in the scale of\r\ngovernment, because they were of importance in their own country, his\r\npre-eminence was seen by William, and perhaps feared. He had been\r\nentrusted with none of the secrets of the revolution from the ambiguity\r\nof his conduct. Yet he took a violent side against King James upon his\r\nfirst retreat, but made apologies to that Prince\u0027s friends, so soon as\r\nhe heard of his return. William, therefore, affected to show him the\r\nhighest honours, cajolling him by those arts which the Duke was in use\r\nto employ upon others. From hence, and from the vanity of pre-eminence,\r\nhe had consented to preside in the Assembly at London, which offered the\r\nPrince the administration of government. And hence, William gave him all\r\nthe influence of the court, to be president of that convention which was\r\nto make the offer of government itself.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Athole was a subject of great consequence, because his\r\nestate and power lay in the heart of the highlands. He had concurred in\r\nall the measures of the two royal brothers, and had been loaded with\r\nfavours and honours by both. Yet, upon news of James\u0027s retreat, he flew,\r\nfrom restlessness of temper more than from principle, to London, while\r\nScotland was yet in disquiet; resolved, amid contending Princes, to make\r\nthe best terms for himself. He almost alone, of all those who went to\r\nLondon to offer their service to the Prince of Orange, returned home\r\ndiscontented; because his views had been too sanguine, and because he\r\nwas ashamed of what he had done. His repentance he made offer of to the\r\nfriends of James in Scotland, which was received, and thanked in public,\r\nbut in secret distrusted.\r\n\r\nLord Stair had none of the external advantages of the other two. Yet,\r\nfrom great reach of thought, and through knowledge of men and parties\r\ngained from experience, he came to be a considerable figure in party....\r\nUpon the restoration he attached himself to the Duke of Lauderdale. The\r\nfuries of that minister he often moderated, and often opposed, openly\r\nwhen he could, secretly when he could not; yet still preserved his\r\nfriendship. After enduring many years the loss of his rank and his\r\ncountry, from the injustice of the Duke of York, he, at the age of\r\nseventy, assumed again his long-neglected sword and cuirass, and came\r\nover with the Prince of Orange, who was so fond of him that he carried\r\nhim in his own ship. The influence of Lord Stair in party was increased\r\nby that of his son Sir John Dalrymple, a man distinguished above all by\r\nthe beauty of his person, and the power of his eloquence. To the wisdom\r\nand experience of the father, to the parts and show of the son, rather\r\nthan to the power of the Duke of Hamilton, William, certain that the two\r\nformer could never hope to be pardoned by James, resolved to leave the\r\nmanagement of Scotland in the end; but, in the meantime, to make\r\nadvantage of the Duke\u0027s offers of service for the settlement of that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOf all those nobles whom James, when Duke of York, had honoured with his\r\nfriendship, and when King, graced with his favours, a few only continued\r\nopenly in his interest. Of these the chief were the Duke of Gordon, a\r\nRoman Catholic, to whom James had entrusted the castle of Edinburgh, a\r\nman weak, and wavering in courage, but bound by shame and religion; Lord\r\nBalcarres attached by affection, gratitude, and that delicacy of\r\nsentiment which the love of letters commonly inspires; and Lord Dundee,\r\nwho had for ever before his eyes ideas of glory, the duty of a soldier,\r\nand the example of the great Montrose, from whose family he was\r\ndescended. James had entrusted the care of his civil concerns in\r\nScotland to Balcarres, and of his military ones to Dundee. William asked\r\nboth to enter into his service. Dundee refused without ceremony.\r\nBalcarres confessed the trust which had been put in him, and asked the\r\nKing, if, after that, he could enter into the service of another?\r\nWilliam generously answered, \"I cannot say that you can.\" But added,\r\n\"Take care that you fall not within the law; for otherwise I shall be\r\nforced against my will to let the law overtake you.\" The other nobles of\r\nthe late King\u0027s party waited for events, in hopes and in fears from the\r\nold government and the new, intriguing with both, and depended upon by\r\nneither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONVENTION OF ESTATES (1689).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland, from the\r\n    Dissolution of the Last Parliament of Charles II. until the\r\n    Sea-Battle off La Hogue_, vol. i., p. 218, by Sir John Dalrymple,\r\n    Bart. (London and Edinburgh: 1771.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe convention met on the 14th of March. As the governing part of the\r\nboroughs had been modelled by King James, the members sent up from\r\nthence should have been favourable to his interests. But Lord Stair,\r\nwhose views were extensive, had taken care, in the paper which contained\r\nthe offer of administration to the Prince, to recommend that the\r\nborough-elections should be made by a general poll of the burgesses; an\r\nartifice which, while it took the blame of innovation off the Prince,\r\nprepared the way for securing the elections to the whigs and\r\npresbyterians. The parties at the convention first tried their strengths\r\nin the choice of a president. The Duke of Hamilton was set up by the\r\nnew, the Marquis of Athole by the old court: a singular situation, where\r\nboth candidates were distrusted, both by those who recommended, and by\r\nthose who elected them. The former was preferred by 40 votes out of\r\nabout 150 voters: a victory which, from the nature of the human mind,\r\ndetermined the wavering. A committee of elections was next named,\r\nconsisting of nine whigs and three tories. Sir John Dalrymple, who was\r\nan able lawyer, found it easy to start objections to the returns of the\r\nopposite party, and to remove those which were made against his own. The\r\ncommittee in the house followed his opinions, because the necessity of\r\nthe times was made the excuse of partiality....\r\n\r\nWhen the convention sat down, two letters were presented, one from the\r\npresent, and another from the late King of England. The convention read\r\nboth; but first passed an act, that nothing contained in the last of\r\nthem should dissolve their assembly, or stop their proceeding to the\r\nsettlement of the nation. James\u0027s letter was written in the terms of a\r\nconqueror and a priest; threatening the convention with punishment in\r\nthis world, and damnation in the next. And, as it was counter-signed by\r\nLord Melfort, a papist, and a minister abhorred by the presbyterians,\r\nthe style and the signature hurt equally the interest which the letter\r\nwas intended to serve. No answer was given. William\u0027s letter, on the\r\ncontrary, was answered in strains of gratitude and respect; a\r\ndistinction which sufficiently showed what might be expected with regard\r\nto the future resolutions of the assembly....\r\n\r\nThe revolution in England was brought about by a coalition of whigs and\r\ntories; but, in Scotland, by the whigs almost alone. Hence, the Scottish\r\nconvention, instead of amusing themselves with school disputes about\r\nwords, which, while they discovered the fine lines of party in England,\r\nhad embarrassed the English convention, struck their blow without\r\nceremony, and came to a resolution, that King James had, by his evil\r\ndeeds, _forfaulted_ his right to the crown; a term which, in the\r\nlanguage of the law of Scotland, involved in it the exclusion of all his\r\nposterity as well as his own. But, as this resolution would have\r\ncomprehended the other children of James, as well as the young Prince,\r\nthey agreed upon the following explanation of the word _forfaulted_.\r\n\"Agreed, that the word _forfault_, in the resolution, should imply no\r\nother alteration in the succession to the crown than the seclusion of\r\nKing James, the pretended Prince of Wales, and the children that shall\r\nbe procreated of either of their bodies.\" Only five opposed these\r\nresolutions....\r\n\r\nThe convention next made offer of the crown to William and Mary: a vote\r\nin which the Duke of Queensberry and the Marquis of Athole concurred,\r\nalthough they had refused to be present at the other. They reconciled\r\ntheir conduct by saying, \"That, since the throne was declared vacant by\r\nthe nation, they knew none so worthy to fill it as the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Orange\"--a mixture of sentiment, intended to please both\r\nKings, but which, like most compliments of the kind, pleased neither.\r\nFrom an excess of zeal which betrayed the cause of it, the Duke of\r\nHamilton demeaned himself to act the part of a clerk; reading, at the\r\nordinary place of proclamation, the act of convention aloud to the mean\r\nmultitude, who found even their own vanity hurt in the sacrifice which\r\nwas made to it by the first man in the nation. With more dignity the\r\nparliament accompanied the offer of the crown with such a declaration of\r\nrights as laid open all the invasions upon the constitution, not of the\r\nlate King alone, but of his brother, and ascertained every disputed\r\npretension between the crown and the subject; for, accustomed either to\r\ntrample upon their sovereigns, or to be trampled upon by them, the\r\nScottish nation chose to leave nothing to be adjusted afterwards by the\r\nvibration between the executive and legislative powers, which had kept\r\nthe English constitution almost continually in a just medium between the\r\nimperiousness of the crown and the licentiousness of the subject. The\r\nEarl of Argyle for the peers, Sir James Montgomery for the knights, and\r\nSir John Dalrymple for the boroughs, were sent to London with the offer\r\nof the crown....\r\n\r\nThe administration of the coronation-oath of Scotland was a ceremony\r\nattended with much awe; the King holding up his right hand high, whilst\r\nhe swore, and repeated each word with slowness after the person who read\r\nit. It contained a clause, that the King should root out heretics. At\r\nthese words, William stopt the Earl of Argyle, who was administering the\r\noath, and declared, he did not mean to oblige himself to become a\r\npersecutor. The commissioners answering, that such was not the meaning\r\nof the oath: \"Then,\" said the King, \"I take it in that sense only.\"\r\nWhether this scruple was the effect of affectation or of delicacy, is\r\nimmaterial: it became a King, and it pleased the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNDEE\u0027S REBELLION (1689).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of the War carried on in Scotland and Ireland,\r\n    1689-1691_, by Major-General Hugh Mackay, Commander-in-Chief of His\r\n    Majesty\u0027s forces. _With an appendix of original papers_, p. 225.\r\n    (Edinburgh: Bannatyne Club, 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUKE OF HAMILTON TO LORD MELVILL.\r\n\r\n                                           _Holyroodhous, 8 June, 1689._\r\n\r\nYesternight I received your lordship\u0027s of the 4th instant, with one to\r\nGeneral Major Mackay; I did the same night send one to the west to\r\ndispatch some to Ireland for intelligence, and write two several ways to\r\nthe captains of our ships to go to the coast of Ireland to cruise there,\r\nand give the best account they could if there was any appearance of an\r\ninvasion from thence, which, I am confident, there is little fears of,\r\nif it be not by the French fleet, and it\u0027s very strange if they can be\r\nable to come to our coasts and land men, if there be an English and\r\nDutch fleet at sea as you write, but if they should be able to land any\r\nconsiderable force we should be in an ill condition, considering how\r\ndisaffected all the north is, and if we should absolutely with all his\r\nforces recall Mackay before he dissipates or beats Dundee, all that\r\ncountry generally, lowlands as well as highlands, would be in arms with\r\nhim; so, upon communicating your letter to the Council this morning,\r\nthey thought it not fit absolutely to recall him, but leave it much to\r\nhimself, and desired him to send any of the English horse that is with\r\nhim to the west country, where they can be best provided with horse\r\nmeat, and most of our own new levied horse we intend should go there\r\nalso, and some regiments of our foot lays there and about Stirling, the\r\nrest being in St. Johnston,[1] Dundie, and about this place, beside what\r\nis with Mackay, from whom we have not heard since what I sent you.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 248.

But\r\npresently upon that order, having discovered some bodies of them\r\nmarching down an high hill, within a quarter of a mile to the place\r\nwhere he stood, when the gross[3] of their body appeared, fearing that\r\nthey should take possession of an eminence just above the ground where\r\nour forces halted on, of a steep and difficult ascent, full of trees and\r\nshrubs, and within a carbine shot of the place whereon we stood, whereby\r\nthey could undoubtedly force us with their fire in confusion over the\r\nriver, he galloped back in all haste to the forces, and having made\r\nevery battalion form by a Quart de Conversion to the right upon the\r\nground they stood, made them march each before his face up the hill, by\r\nwhich means he prevented that inconveniency, and got a ground fair\r\nenough to receive the enemy, but not to attack them, there being, within\r\na short musket shot to it, another eminence before our front, as we\r\nstood when we were up the lowest hill, near the river, whereof Dundee\r\nhad already got possession before we could be well up, and had his back\r\nto a very high hill, which is the ordinary maxim of Highlanders, who\r\nnever fight against regular forces upon anything of equal terms, without\r\na sure retreat at their back, particularly if their enemies be provided\r\nof horse; and to be sure of their escape, in case of a repulse, they\r\nattack bare footed, without any clothing but their shirts, and a little\r\nHighland doublet, whereby they are certain to outrun any foot, and will\r\nnot readily engage where horse can follow the chase any distance....\r\nShortly thereafter, and about half an hour before sunset, they began to\r\nmove down the hill.\r\n\r\nThe General had already commanded the officers, commanding battalions,\r\nto begin their firing at the distance of 100 paces by platoons, to\r\ndiscourage the approaching Highlanders, meeting with continual fire:\r\nThat part of their forces which stood opposite to Hastings, who had the\r\nright of all, before the Generals\u0027, Levin\u0027s and Kenmore\u0027s regiments,\r\ncame down briskly together with their horse, and notwithstanding of a\r\nbrisk fire, particularly from the General\u0027s own battalion, whereby many\r\nof the chief gentlemen of the name of Macdonald, who attacked it, were\r\nkilled, pushed their point, after they had fired their light pieces at\r\nsome distance, which made little or no execution, with sword in hand,\r\ntho\u0027 in great confusion, which is their usual way. Which when the\r\nGeneral observed, he called to the Lord Belhaven to march up with the\r\nfirst troop of horse, ordering him to flank to the left hand the enemy,\r\nthe fire being then past on all hands, and coming to handy strokes if\r\nour men had stood, appointing the second troop to do the same to the\r\nright; but scarcely had Belhaven got them without the front of the line,\r\nwhere they had orders to wheel for the flank, tho\u0027 their very appearance\r\nmade the enemy turn away from the place where they saw the horse coming\r\nup, but contrary to orders, they began to pass, not knowing whereat, and\r\npresently turned about, as did also Kenmore\u0027s and the half of Levin\u0027s\r\nbattalion.\r\n\r\nThe General, observing the horse come to a stand, and firing in\r\nconfusion, and the foot beginning to fall away from him, thinking\r\nhappily that the horse would be picked to follow his example, and in all\r\ncases to disengage himself out of the crowd of Highlanders which came\r\ndown just upon the place where he was calling to the officers of the\r\nhorse to follow him, spurr\u0027d his horse through the enemy, (where no body\r\nnevertheless followed him, but one of his servants, whose horse was shot\r\nin passing).... Having passed through the crowd of attacking\r\nHighlanders, he turned about to see how matters stood, and found that\r\nall his left had given way, and got down the hill which was behind our\r\nline, ranged a little above the brow thereof, so that in the twinkling\r\nof an eye in a manner, our men, as well as the enemy, were out of sight,\r\nbeing got down pall mall to the river where our baggage stood....\r\n\r\nThe enemy lost on the field six for our one, the fire to our right\r\nhaving been continued and brisk, whereby not only Dundee, with several\r\ngentlemen of quality of the countys of Angus and Perth, but also many of\r\nthe best gentlemen among the Highlanders, particularly of the Macdonalds\r\nof the Isles and Glengarie, were killed, coming down the hill upon\r\nHastings, the General, and Levin\u0027s regiments, which made the best fire\r\nand all the execution....\r\n\r\nThe General having got the small rests of his forces safely over the\r\nriver, and seeing no disposition, so far as he could discern, of the\r\nenemy to pursue him, he bethought himself which way he had best retire;\r\nand notwithstanding of the contrary advice of all the officers who would\r\nhave him to descend the plain country of Athole to Dunkeld and Perth, he\r\nresolved rather to march into the Highlands three or four miles, and\r\nthen over to Strath Tay and along the foot of the hills, over the Castle\r\nof Drummond, where he had a garrison, to Stirling, whither he resolved\r\nto make all the speed possible, to fall upon some present measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Major-General Mackay, commanding the Royal troops.\r\n\r\n[3] Bulk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS SETTLEMENT (1690).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Letters and State Papers chiefly Addressed to George,\r\n    Earl of Melville, Secretary of State for Scotland, 1689-1691_, p.\r\n    436.

REPORT OF THE COMMISSION GIVEN BY HIS MAJESTY, UNDER THE GREAT SEAL,\r\n29TH APRIL, 1695, FOR INQUIRING INTO THE SLAUGHTER OF THE MEN OF GLENCO,\r\n13TH FEBRUARY, 1692 (_idem_, p. 99).\r\n\r\n                                     _At Holyrudhouse, 20th June, 1695._\r\n\r\n... The things to be remark\u0027d preceding the said slaughter were, that\r\nit\u0027s certain that the Lairds of Glenco and Auchintriaten, and their\r\nfollowers, were in the insurrection and rebellion made by some of the\r\nHighland clans, under the command, first of the Viscount of Dundee, and\r\nthen of Major-Gen. Buchan, in the years 1689 and 1690. This is\r\nacknowledg\u0027d by all. But when the Earl of Breadalbane called the heads\r\nof the clans, and met with them at Auchallader, in July 1691, in order\r\nto a cessation, the deceas\u0027d Alexander Macdonald of Glenco was there,\r\nwith Glengary, Sir John Maclene, and others, and agreed to the\r\ncessation; as it is also acknowledg\u0027d.... And here the Commissioners\r\ncannot but take notice of what hath occurr\u0027d to them in two letters from\r\nSecretary Stair, to Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, one of the 1st, and\r\nanother of the 3d of December, 1691, wherein he expresses his\r\nresentment from the marring of the bargain that should have been betwixt\r\nthe Earl of Breadalbane and the Highlanders, to a very great height; ...\r\n--And, in effect, seems, even at that time, which was almost a month\r\nbefore the expiring of the King\u0027s indemnity, to project, with\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, that some of them should be rooted out and\r\ndestroyed. His Majesty\u0027s proclamation of indemnity was publish\u0027d in Aug.\r\n1691, offering a free indemnity and pardon to all the Highlanders who\r\nhad been in arms, upon their coming in, and taking the oath of\r\nallegiance, betwixt then and the first of January thereafter: And, in\r\ncompliance with the proclamation, the deceas\u0027d Glenco goes, about the\r\nend of Decemb. 1691, to Col. Hill, Governor of Fort William at\r\nInverlochie, and desir\u0027d the Colonel to minister to him the oath of\r\nallegiance, that he might have the King\u0027s indemnity: But Col. Hill, in\r\nhis deposition, doth further depone, that he hasten\u0027d him away all he\r\ncould, and gave him a letter to Ardkinlas to receive him as a lost\r\nsheep; ... Sir Colin Campbell of Ardkinlas, Sherif-Deput of Argyle,\r\ndepones, that the deceas\u0027d Glenco came to Inverary about the beginning\r\nof January, 1692, with a letter from Colonel Hill, to the effect above\r\nmentioned, and was three days there before Ardkinlas could get thither,\r\nbecause of bad weather; and that Glenco said to him, that he had not\r\ncome sooner because he was hinder\u0027d by the storm; and Ardkinlas farther\r\ndepones, that when he declin\u0027d to give the oath of allegiance to Glenco,\r\nbecause the last of December, the time appointed for the taking of it,\r\nwas past, Glenco begg\u0027d, with tears, that he might be admitted to take\r\nit, and promis\u0027d to bring in all his people within a short time to do\r\nthe like, and, if any of them refused, they should be imprisoned, or\r\nsent to Flanders: upon which, Ardkinlas says, he did administer to him\r\nthe oath of allegiance upon the 6th of January, 1692....\r\n\r\nThese things having preceded the slaughter, which happen\u0027d not to be\r\ncommitted until the 13th of February, 1692, six weeks after the deceas\u0027d\r\nGlenco had taken the oath of allegiance at Inverary. The slaughter of\r\nthe Glenco men was in this manner, viz., John and Alexander MacDonalds,\r\nsons to the deceas\u0027d Glenco, depone, that Glengary\u0027s house being\r\nreduc\u0027d, the forces were called back to the south, and Glenlyon, a\r\ncaptain of the Earl of Argyle\u0027s regiment, with Lieutenant Lindsay, and\r\nEnsign Lindsay, and six score soldiers, return\u0027d to Glenco about the 1st\r\nof February, 1692, where, at their entry, the elder brother, John, met\r\nthem, with about 20 men, and demanded the reason of their coming; and\r\nLieutenant Lindsay showed him his orders for quartering there, under\r\nColonel Hill\u0027s hand, and gave assurance that they were only come to\r\nquarter; whereupon they were billeted in the country, and had free\r\nquarters, and kind entertainment, living familiarly with the people\r\nuntil the 13th day of Feb.; and Alexander farther depones, that\r\nGlenlyon, being his wife\u0027s uncle, came almost every day, and took his\r\nmorning drink at his house, and that the very night before the\r\nslaughter, Glenlyon did play at cards, in his own quarters, with both\r\nthe brothers; and John depones, that old Glenco, his father, had invited\r\nGlenlyon, Lieutenant Lindsay, and Ensign Lindsay, to dine with him upon\r\nthe very day the slaughter happened. But, on the 13th day of February,\r\nbeing Saturday, about four, or five, in the morning, Lieutenant Lindsay,\r\nwith a party of the foresaid soldiers, came to old Glenco\u0027s house,\r\nwhere, having call\u0027d, in a friendly manner, and got in, they shot his\r\nfather dead, with several shots, as he was rising out of his bed; and,\r\nthe mother having got up, and put on her clothes, the soldiers stripp\u0027d\r\nher naked, and drew the rings off her fingers with their teeth; as\r\nlikewise they killed one man more, and wounded another grievously, at\r\nthe same place.... And the said John, Alexander, and Archibald\r\nMacDonalds, do all depone, that, the same morning, there was one\r\nSergeant Barber, and a party, at Auchnaion, and that Auchintriaten being\r\nthere, in his brother\u0027s house, with eight more, sitting about the fire,\r\nthe soldiers discharged upon them about 18 shot, which killed\r\nAuchintriaten, and four more; ... And, at Innerriggin, where Glenlyon\r\nwas quartered, the soldiers took other nine men, and did bind them, hand\r\nand foot, [and] kill\u0027d them, one by one, with shot; and, when Glenlyon\r\ninclin\u0027d to save a young man, of about 20 years of age, one Captain\r\nDrummond came, and ask\u0027d how he came to be sav\u0027d in respect of the\r\norders that were given, and shot him dead; and another young boy, of\r\nabout 13 years, ran to Glenlyon, to be sav\u0027d. He was likewise shot\r\ndead.... And all these five witnesses concur, that the aforesaid\r\nslaughter was made by Glenlyon, and his soldiers, after they had been\r\nquarter\u0027d, and liv\u0027d peaceably, and friendly, with the Glenco men about\r\n13 days, and that the number of those whom they knew to be slain were\r\nabout 25, and that the soldiers, after the slaughter, did burn the\r\nhouses, barns, and goods, and carried away a great spoil of horse,\r\nnolt,[8] and sheep, above a 1,000.\r\n\r\n... And upon the whole matter, it is the opinion of the Commission,\r\nFirst, that it was a great wrong that Glenco\u0027s case, and diligence as to\r\nhis taking the oath of allegiance, with Ardkinlas\u0027s certificate of his\r\ntaking the oath of allegiance on the 6th of January, 1692, and Col.\r\nHill\u0027s letter to Ardkinlas, and Ardkinlas\u0027s letter to Colin Campbell,\r\nSheriff-Clerk, for clearing Glenco\u0027s diligence and innocence, were not\r\npresented to the Lords of his Majesty\u0027s Privy Council, when they were\r\nsent into Edinburgh, in the said month of January, and that those who\r\nadvis\u0027d the not presenting thereof were in the wrong, and seem to have\r\nhad a malicious design against Glenco; ... Secondly, that it appears to\r\nhave been known at London, and particularly to the Master of Stair, in\r\nthe month of January, 1692, that Glenco had taken the oath of\r\nallegiance, tho\u0027 after the day prefix\u0027d; for he saith, in his letter of\r\nthe 30th of January, to Sir Tho. Livingston, as is above remark\u0027d, \"I am\r\nglad that Glenco came not in within the time prescrib\u0027d.\" Thirdly, that\r\nthere was nothing in the King\u0027s instructions to warrant the committing\r\nof the foresaid slaughter, even as to the thing it self, and far less as\r\nto the manner of it, seeing all his instructions do plainly import, that\r\nthe most obstinate of the rebels might be received into mercy upon\r\ntaking the oath of allegiance, tho\u0027 the day was long before elaps\u0027d, and\r\nthat he ordered nothing concerning Glenco and his tribe, but that \"if\"\r\nthey could \"be well separated from the rest, it\" would \"be a proper\r\nindication of the publick justice to extirpate that sept of thieves\";\r\nwhich plainly intimates, that it was his Majesty\u0027s mind that they could\r\nnot be separated from the rest of these rebels, unless they still\r\nrefused his mercy by continuing in arms and refusing the allegiance, and\r\nthat, even in that case, they were only to be proceeded against in the\r\nway of publick justice, and no other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Of allegiance to King William.\r\n\r\n[5] The Master of Stair.\r\n\r\n[6] Probably fear.\r\n\r\n[7] Ballachulish.\r\n\r\n[8] Cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANK OF SCOTLAND (1695).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland_, vol. ix., p.\r\n    495.

THE PROJECT AND ITS ORIGINATOR (1695).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--Bishop Burnet\u0027s _History of His Own Times_, vol. iv., p.\r\n    282. (Oxford: 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother act passed, that has already produced very fatal consequences to\r\nthat kingdom[11]; and may yet draw worse after it: the interlopers in\r\nthe East India trade, finding that the company was like to be favoured\r\nby the parliament, as well as by the court, were resolved to try other\r\nmethods to break in upon that trade: they entered into a treaty with\r\nsome merchants in Scotland; and they had, in the former session,\r\nprocured an act, that promised letters patents to all such as should\r\noffer to set up new manufactures, or drive any new trade, not yet\r\npractised by that kingdom, with an exemption for twenty-one years from\r\nall taxes and customs, and with all such other privileges, as should be\r\nfound necessary for establishing or encouraging such projects. But here\r\nwas a necessity of procuring letters patents, which they knew the credit\r\nthat the East India company had at court would certainly render\r\nineffectual. So they were now in treaty for a new act, which should free\r\nthem from that difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere was one Paterson, a man of no education, but of great notions;\r\nwhich, as was generally said, he had learned from the Buccaneers, with\r\nwhom he had consorted for some time. He had considered a place in\r\nDarien, where he thought a good settlement might be made, with another\r\nover against it, in the South Sea; and by two settlements there, he\r\nfancied a great trade might be opened both for the East and West Indies;\r\nand that the Spaniards in the neighbourhood might be kept in great\r\nsubjection to them; so he made the merchants believe, that he had a\r\ngreat secret, which he did not think fit yet to discover, and reserved\r\nto a fitter opportunity; only he desired, that the West Indies might be\r\nnamed in any new act that should be offered to the parliament: he made\r\nthem in general understand, that he knew of a country, not possessed by\r\nSpaniards, where there were rich mines, and gold in abundance. While\r\nthese matters were in treaty, the time of the King\u0027s giving the\r\ninstructions to his commissioner for the parliament came on; and it had\r\nbeen a thing of course, to give a general instruction, to pass all bills\r\nfor the encouragement of trade. Johnstoun told the King, that he heard\r\nthere was a secret management among the merchants for an act in\r\nScotland, under which the East India trade might be set up; so he\r\nproposed, and drew an instruction, impowering the commissioner to pass\r\nany bill, promising letters patents for encouraging of trade, yet\r\nlimited, so that it should not interfere with the trade of England: when\r\nthey went down to Scotland, the King\u0027s commissioner either did not\r\nconsider this, or had no regard to it; for he gave the royal assent to\r\nan act, that gave the undertakers, either of the East India or West\r\nIndia trade, all possible privileges, with exemption of twenty-one years\r\nfrom all impositions: and the act directed letters patents to be passed\r\nunder the great seal, without any further warrant for them: when this\r\nwas printed, it gave a great alarm in England, more particularly to the\r\nEast India company; for many of the merchants of London resolved to join\r\nstock with the Scotch company; and the exemption from all duties gave a\r\ngreat prospect of gain. Such was the posture of affairs in Scotland....\r\n\r\nGreat complaints were made in both houses of the act for the Scotch East\r\nIndia company, and addresses were made to the King, setting forth the\r\ninconveniencies that were like to arise from thence to England: the King\r\nanswered, that he had been ill served in Scotland: but he hoped remedies\r\nshould be found, to prevent the ill consequences that they apprehended\r\nfrom the act: and soon after this, he turned out both the secretaries of\r\nstate, and the marquis of Tweedale: and great changes were made in the\r\nwhole ministry of that Kingdom, both high and low....\r\n\r\nBut when it was understood in Scotland that the King had disowned the\r\nact for the East India company, from which it was expected that great\r\nriches should flow into that Kingdom, it is not easy to conceive how\r\ngreat and how general an indignation was spread over the whole kingdom:\r\nthe Jacobites saw what a game it was like to prove in their hands; they\r\nplayed it with great skill, and to the advantage of their cause, in a\r\ncourse of many years; and continue to manage it to this day: there was a\r\ngreat deal of noise made of the Scotch act in both houses of parliament\r\nin England, by some who seemed to have no other design in that, but to\r\nheighten our distractions by the apprehensions that they expressed. The\r\nScotch nation fancied nothing but mountains of gold; and the credit of\r\nthe design rose so high, that subscriptions were made, and advances of\r\nmoney were offered, beyond what any believed the wealth of that Kingdom\r\ncould have furnished. Paterson came to have such credit among them, that\r\nthe design of the East India trade, how promising soever, was wholly\r\nlaid aside: and they resolved to employ all their wealth in the settling\r\na colony, with a port and fortifications, in Darien; which was long kept\r\na secret, and was only trusted to a select number, who assumed to\r\nthemselves the name of the African company, though they never meddled\r\nwith any concern in that part of the world; the unhappy progress of the\r\naffair will appear in its proper time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

WHY THE COLONY FAILED (1698).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--Bishop Burnet\u0027s _History of His Own Times_, vol. iv., p.\r\n    395. (Oxford: 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\n... The company in Scotland, this year, set out a fleet, with a colony,\r\non design to settle in America: the secret was better kept than could\r\nhave been well expected, considering the many hands in which it was\r\nlodged; it appeared at last, that the true design had been guessed, from\r\nthe first motion of it: they landed at Darien, which, by the report that\r\nthey sent over, was capable of being made a strong place, with a good\r\nport. It was no wonder that the Spaniards complained loudly of this; it\r\nlay so near Porto Bello and Panama on the one side, and Carthagena on\r\nthe other, that they could not think they were safe, when such a\r\nneighbour came so near the centre of their Empire in America: the King\r\nof France complained also of this, as an invasion of the Spanish\r\ndominions, and offered the court of Madrid a fleet to dislodge them. The\r\nSpaniards pressed the King hard upon this: they said, they were once\r\npossessed of that place; and though they found it too unhealthy to\r\nsettle there, yet the right to it belonged still to them: so this was a\r\nbreach of treaties, and a violent possession of their country. In answer\r\nto this, the Scotch pretended, that the natives of Darien were never\r\nconquered by the Spaniards, and were by consequence a free people; they\r\nsaid, they had purchased of them leave to possess themselves of that\r\nplace, and that the Spaniards abandoned the country, because they could\r\nnot reduce the natives: so the pretension of the first discovery was\r\nmade void, when they went off from it, not being able to hold it; and\r\nthen the natives being left to themselves, it was lawful for the Scots\r\nto treat with them: it was given out, that there was much gold in the\r\ncountry. Certainly, the nation was so full of hopes from this project,\r\nthat they raised a fund for carrying it on, greater than, as was\r\nthought, that kingdom could stretch to; four hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling was subscribed, and a fourth part was paid down, and\r\nafterwards, seventy thousand pounds more was brought in, and a national\r\nfury seemed to have transported the whole kingdom, upon this project.\r\n\r\n... Our English plantations grew ... very jealous of this new colony:\r\nthey feared, that the double prospect of finding gold and of robbing the\r\nSpaniards, would draw many planters from them into this new settlement;\r\nand that the buccaneers might run into them: for by the Scotch act, this\r\nplace was to be made a free port; and if it was not ruined before it was\r\nwell formed, they reckoned it would become a seat of piracy and another\r\nAlgiers in those parts. Upon these grounds, the English nation inclined\r\nto declare against this, and the King seemed convinced, that it was an\r\ninfraction of his treaties with Spain: so orders were sent, but very\r\nsecretly, to the English plantations, particularly to Jamaica and the\r\nLeeward islands, to forbid all commerce with the Scots at Darien. The\r\nSpaniards made some faint attempts on them, but without success. This\r\nwas a very great difficulty on the King; he saw how much he was like to\r\nbe pressed on both hands, and he apprehended what ill consequences were\r\nlike to follow, on his declaring himself either way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. INDIGNATION IN SCOTLAND (1699).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--Bishop Burnet\u0027s _History of His Own Times_, vol. iv., p.\r\n    429. (Oxford: 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Scotland all men were full of hopes, that their new colony should\r\nbring them home mountains of gold; the proclamations sent to Jamaica and\r\nto the other English plantations were much complained of, as acts of\r\nhostility, and a violation of the common rights of humanity; these had a\r\ngreat effect on them, though without these, that colony was too weak and\r\ntoo ill supplied, as well as too much divided within itself, to have\r\nsubsisted long; those, who had first possessed themselves of it, were\r\nforced to abandon it: soon after they had gone from it, a second recruit\r\nof men and provisions was sent thither from Scotland; but one of their\r\nships unhappily took fire, in which they had the greatest stock of\r\nprovisions; and so these likewise went off: and though the third\r\nreinforcement, that soon followed this, was both stronger and better\r\nfurnished, yet they fell into such factions among themselves, that they\r\nwere too weak to resist the Spaniards, who, feeble as they were, yet saw\r\nthe necessity of attacking them: and they finding themselves unable to\r\nresist the force which was brought against them, capitulated; and with\r\nthat the whole design fell to the ground, partly for want of stock and\r\nskill in those who managed it, and partly by the baseness and treachery\r\nof those whom they employed.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the King\u0027s ministers in Scotland was much censured in the\r\nwhole progress of this affair; for they had connived at it, if not\r\nencouraged it, in hopes that the design would fall of itself; but now it\r\nwas not so easy to cure the universal discontent, which the miscarriage\r\nof this design, to the impoverishing the whole kingdom, had raised, and\r\nwhich now began to spread, like a contagion, among all sorts of people.\r\nA petition for a present session of parliament was immediately sent\r\nabout the kingdom, and was signed by many thousands: this was sent up by\r\nsome of the chief of their nobility, whom the King received very coldly:\r\nyet a session of parliament was granted them, to which the duke of\r\nQueensbury was sent down commissioner ... it was further given out, to\r\nraise the national disgust yet higher, that the opposition the King gave\r\nto the Scotch colony, flowed neither from a regard to the interests of\r\nEngland, nor to the treaties with Spain, but from a care of the Dutch,\r\nwho from Curasoe[12] drove a coasting trade, among the Spanish\r\nplantations, with great advantage; which, they said, the Scotch colony,\r\nif once well settled, would draw wholly from them.... In the session of\r\nparliament it was carried by a vote, to make the affair of Darien a\r\nnational concern: upon that, the session was for some time discontinued.\r\nWhen the news of the total abandoning of Darien was brought over, it\r\ncannot be well expressed into how bad a temper this cast the body of\r\nthat people: they had now lost almost two hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling upon this project, besides all the imaginary treasure they had\r\npromised themselves from it: so the nation was raised into a sort of a\r\nfury upon it, and in the first heat of that, a remonstrance was sent\r\nabout the kingdom for hands, representing to the King, the necessity for\r\na present sitting of the parliament, which was drawn in so high a\r\nstrain, as if they had resolved to pursue the effects of it by an armed\r\nforce. It was signed by a great majority of the members of parliament;\r\nand the ferment in men\u0027s spirits was raised so high, that few thought it\r\ncould have been long curbed, without breaking forth into great\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Curacoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION IMPENDING (1703).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of the Life of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik,\r\n    Baronet, Baron of the Exchequer: extracted by himself from his own\r\n    Journals, 1676-1755_, p. 46. (Edinburgh: Scottish Historical\r\n    Society, 1892.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA Convention of Estates followed the Revolution by King William in 1688,\r\nwhich was afterwards turned into a Parliament, and continued \u0027till the\r\nDeath of that King in 1702. The same parliament continued to sit upon\r\nthe accession of Queen Ann to the Crown, and was not dissolved till the\r\nyear 1703, when the new Parliament was called.... I have thrown together\r\nsome observations on this session of Parliament in another Manuscript\r\nbook, so shall say little here. It was divided into 3 factions, who, as\r\nthey had different views, drove different ways. The first was what was\r\ncalled the Court party; they were for supporting the Crown and the\r\nCredit of the High Commissioner, consequently they were for giving\r\nmoderate subsidies for supporting the Government against the insults of\r\nthe French, with whom we were, at that time, in war. They had the union\r\nof the two nations in view, because they not only considered it as the\r\nhappiest thing that could be brought about for the Interest of Great\r\nBritain, but because it was expressly recommended to them by the Queen.\r\nThe second faction was that of the Jacobites; they were to thwart and\r\ndisturb the Administration at any rate. The third faction was what went\r\nunder the name of the Squadrone Volante. These consisted of about\r\nfifteen Lords and Gentlemen, all Whigs in their principles, but who\r\nherded together, and kept little or no communication with the Duke of\r\nQueensberry[13] and his Friends. They were for opposing everything which\r\nthey durst oppose, but to keep firmly in their view the succession of\r\nthe Crown in the House of Hanover. They pretended to be great Patriots,\r\nand to stand up chiefly in defence of the rights and privileges of the\r\nsubjects; in a word, the public good and the liberty of the subjects\r\nwere still in their mouths, but in their Hearts they were known to have\r\nCourt preferments and places in the chiefest degree of veneration. These\r\nwere the springs and motives of all their Actions, which appeared in a\r\nhundred instances thereafter. However, by the bye, I must say that such\r\na Squadrone Volante in any Parliament seems to be always a happy means\r\nin the hand of Providence to keep the several members of an\r\nAdministration in their duty, for people in great power seldom fail to\r\ntake more upon them than falls to their share.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the Squadrone Lords were the Dukes of Montrose and\r\nRoxburgh, the Earls of Rothes and Haddington, all these young men of\r\nabout 24 years of Age; but the chief of all, at least the man under\r\nwhose name they principally voted, was the Marquis of Tweeddale, a very\r\ngood Man, but not perfectly qualified for Court intrigues.\r\n\r\nAmongst their Gentlemen was one Mr. Fletcher of Saltoun, a Man of\r\nRepublican principles, who had spent his youth in Holland, had been\r\nforfeited under the late King James, but afterwards restored under King\r\nWilliam by Act of Parliament. He was a man a little untoward in his\r\ntemper, and much inclined to Eloquence. He made many speeches in\r\nParliament, which are all printed, but was not very dexterous in making\r\nextemporary replies. He was, however, a very Honest Man, and meant well\r\nin everything he said and did, except in cases where his humour,\r\npassion, or prejudices were suffered to get the better of his reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] The Royal Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION OF THE CROWNS.\r\n\r\nA. THE LAST SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT (1705).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_A Journey to Edenborough in Scotland_, p. 112, by Joseph\r\n    Taylor, late of the Inner Temple, Esquire. Edited from the original\r\n    manuscript by William Cowan. (Edinburgh: 1903.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt hapned whilst we were at Edenborough, that the Act for a treaty of\r\nUnion, between England and Scotland, was upon debate, and having the\r\nhonour to have severall Lords and Members of parliament often dine with\r\nus, they inform\u0027d us of the Grand day when the Act was to be past or\r\nrejected, and by speciall favour of my Lord high Commissioner, we had\r\nleave to stand upon the throne by his right hand: The usuall way to\r\nadmit strangers is to give them a battoon; which holding in their hands,\r\nshows that they are forreigners. The Lords and Comons sit together; As\r\nsoon as we heard the names call\u0027d over, We observ\u0027d Dukes, Marquesses,\r\nand Earles sat on the Uppermost seats on the right hand, Viscounts and\r\nBarons on the uppermost Seats of the left, The Knights of the Shires\r\nunder the Dukes, Marquesses, and Earles, and the Burgesses and Commoners\r\nunder the Viscounts and Barons. The Lord Chancellor under the\r\nCommissioner\u0027s Throne, The Lord Treasurer on his right hand, and the\r\nSecretary of State on his left, and directly under him the Lord Justice\r\nClerk, and at the head of a long Table, on which is plac\u0027t the Crown,\r\nScepter, and Sword, the Earle Marshall; The Lord high Commissioner has\r\nhis Commission always before him in a velvet purse on his cushion.\r\n\r\nWhen they began to debate, we observ\u0027d that the principall leading men\r\nof the High party, or those which oppos\u0027d the Court, were the Duke of\r\nH----,[14] the Duke of A----,[15] the Lord C----y,[16] and the Lord\r\nB--a--en,[17] and one Fletcher of Salton, who speaks well, but with a\r\ngreat deal of passion, The Earle of S--f--d,[18] who is Lord C----r,[19]\r\nis a very ingenious man, His cheif perfection, and what is most\r\nrequisite for his office in the house, is resuming debates, which he\r\ndoes with an admirable dexterity, by giving soe happy a turn for the\r\nInterest of the party he espouses, that he generally carryes the point,\r\nwithout the censure of either party. The Lord high Commissioner says\r\nnothing; The Duke of Ar----e[20] was thought, as we were told not only\r\ntoo young for so high a Station, but too warm to bear the Reflections of\r\nsome of the leading Malcontents, but on the contrary he behav\u0027d himself\r\nin this criticall juncture, with so sedate and even a Temper, that he\r\njustly gain\u0027d an universall reputation, and brought the Sessions to a\r\nhappy conclusion. The Lord Chancellor determines upon all debates who\r\nshall speak first, when anything is put to the vote, every member is\r\ncall\u0027d by his name, and answers singly, approven, or not approven. The\r\ngrand debate this day, being about the Act for a treaty with England,\r\nmany learned speeches were made on the occasion. Some were for passing\r\nno Act till England had given them satisfaction for the affront they\r\npretended was put upon them, by the Act pass\u0027d last Sessions in England,\r\nwhich not only declar\u0027d them Aliens, but prohibited their goods, and\r\nthereby touch\u0027t them in the most sensible part. Fletcher said, that\r\nEngland could not make them Aliens, since they were naturall born\r\nsubjects to the Queen; ... After his debate, others were for making the\r\nEnglish Aliens in Scotland, as a Retaliation for our making them soe in\r\nEngland: ... But after many other debates, and hard reflections on the\r\nEnglish, it was at last put to the Vote, whether there should be added a\r\nclause to the Act of treaty, which should prohibit any treaty with\r\nEngland, till England had rescinded the Clause of Aliens, or whether it\r\nshould be in a seperate way. Seperate way was carry\u0027d by two Voices, ...\r\nThe next great point was, whether the Queen or parliament should have\r\nnomination of Commissioners: ... \u0027Twas carry\u0027d the Queen should nominate\r\nby 4 Voices. Then a Gentleman propos\u0027d to add a clause, to preserve the\r\ndiscipline and Worship of the Kirk of Scotland, as at present\r\nestablish\u0027d: One propos\u0027d it should be the Religion and Discipline, but\r\nmy Lord Chancellor told them, that was all the same thing, and H----[21]\r\nsaid, \u0027twas not worth a Vote, and his brother the Earl of R----[22]\r\nask\u0027t whether they might not add the Lord\u0027s prayer and Creed, and indeed\r\nby what I could observe, they would add the whole Common Liturgy of the\r\nChurch of England, for they seem\u0027d to be quite tir\u0027d of the Kirk\r\ndiscipline: Now the whole Act being finish\u0027d, the Vote was put whether\r\nit should be carry\u0027d approven, or no, and \u0027twas carry\u0027d approven, by 34\r\nvoices. As soon as this was over, we left the house, and that night\r\nCollonell Ogilby,[23] the Lord Chancellor\u0027s brother, the Lord\r\nHardress,[24] and severall Lords and parliament men, came to our\r\nlodgings, and embrac\u0027d us with all the outward marks of love and\r\nkindness, and seem\u0027d mightily pleas\u0027d at what was done; and told us we\r\nshould now be no more English and Scotch, but Brittons. And thus we\r\nmerrily spent the night, in drinking to the Success of the treaty and\r\nhappy union, and next day, Colonell Ogilby and some Scotch Lords\r\nenquir\u0027d mightily for the 3 English Gentlemen, as they call\u0027d us, having\r\na mind to give us a chirrupping Cup,[25] but we went to Leith that day,\r\nbeing willing to avoid them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Hamilton.\r\n\r\n[15] Athole.\r\n\r\n[16] Cromarty.\r\n\r\n[17] Belhaven.\r\n\r\n[18] Seafield.\r\n\r\n[19] Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[20] Argyle.\r\n\r\n[21] Hamilton.\r\n\r\n[22] Ruglen.\r\n\r\n[23] Colonel Patrick Ogilvy.\r\n\r\n[24] No such peer.\r\n\r\n[25] Stirrup cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. DRAFTING THE TREATY (1706).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of the Life of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik,\r\n    Baronet, Baron of the Exchequer: extracted by himself from his own\r\n    Journals, 1676-1755_, p. 55. (Edinburgh: Scottish Historical\r\n    Society, 1892.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe of the Committee of Parliament for the publick accompts continued our\r\napplications to the matters remitted to us till the Parliament met in\r\nSeptember 1705. John, Duke of Argyle, a youth of about 23 years of age,\r\nwas appointed her Majesty\u0027s High Commissioner, and in this station\r\nbehaved himself in a manner far above what cou\u0027d be expected from one of\r\nhis years.... A ... great benefit I received by my intimacy with the\r\nDuke and his brother was to be recommended to the Queen for one of the\r\nCommissioners to be appointed by Her Majesty for the Treaty of Union\r\nbetween England and Scotland.... This choise, however honourable to me,\r\nwas very far from giving me the least pleasure or satisfaction, for I\r\nhad observed a great backwardness in the Parliament of Scotland for an\r\nUnion with England of any kind whatsoever, and therefore doubted not\r\nbut, after a great deal of expense in attending a Treaty in England, I\r\nshould be oblidged to return with the uneasy reflexion of having either\r\ndone nothing, or nothing to the purpose, as had been the case of former\r\nCommissioners appointed for this end. I was, in short, upon the point of\r\nrefusing the Honour conferred upon me, and the rather that my Father,\r\nwhom I always considered as an Oracle seldom mistaken, seemed not to\r\napprove of it. However, as at last he grew passive, and that the Duke of\r\nQueensberry threatened to withdraw all friendship for me, I suffered my\r\nself to be prevailed upon, and to take journey for London with other\r\nCommissioners, and arrived there on the 13 of Aprile 1706.\r\n\r\n... The Commissioners of both nations met in different apartments in the\r\nRoyal palace of Westminster, which commonly goes under the name of the\r\nCockpit. There was one great Room where they all met when they were\r\ncalled upon to attend the Queen, or were to exchange papers, but they\r\nnever met to hold conferences together except once, when the number of\r\nthe Scotch Representatives for the two Houses of the British Parliament\r\ncame to be debated, all their transactions were reduced in writings\r\nconcerted in seperat apartments. When proposals or Conditions of the\r\nUnion were to be made by the English Commissioners, the Scots were\r\ndesired to meet them in the great Room, and their proposals were given\r\nin by the L^d Chancellor, or the Keeper of the great seal, who was at\r\nthat time the Lord Cooper, and when the Commissioners for Scotland had\r\nany thing to propose, or had answers to be made to the Commissioners of\r\nEngland, these were presented by the L^d Seafield, then Chancellor for\r\nScotland....\r\n\r\nThe first grand point debated by the Commissioners for Scotland amongst\r\nthemselves was whether they should propose to the English a Federal\r\nunion between the two nations, or an Incorporating union. The first was\r\nmost favoured by the people of Scotland, but all the Scots\r\nCommissioners, to a Man, considered it ridiculous and impracticable, for\r\nthat in all the Federal unions there behoved to be a supreme power\r\nlodged somewhere, and wherever this was lodged it henceforth became the\r\nStates General, or, in our way of speaking, the Parliament of Great\r\nBritain, under the same royal power and authority as the two nations are\r\nat present. And in things of the greatest consequence to the two\r\nnations, as in Councils relating to peace and war and subsidies, it was\r\nimpossible that the Representatives or their suffrages in both nations\r\ncou\u0027d be equal, but must be regulated in proportion to the power and\r\nriches of the several publick burdens or Taxations that cou\u0027d affect\r\nthem; in a word, the Scots Commissioners saw that no Union cou\u0027d subsist\r\nbetween the two nations but an incorporating perpetual one. But after\r\nall the trouble we gave ourselves to please the people of Scotland, we\r\nknew at the time that it was but losing our labour, for the English\r\nCommissioners were positively resolved to treat on no kind of union with\r\nus but what was to be incorporating and perpetual....\r\n\r\nThe Queen came among us three several times, once at our first or\r\nsecond meeting, to acquaint us of her intentions and ardent good wishes\r\nfor our success and unanimity in this great Transaction. At about a\r\nmonth thereafter she came again to enquire of our success, and had most\r\nof our Minutes read to her, and for the last time of what we had\r\ndone....\r\n\r\nI was ... intrusted with another province by the Commissioners for\r\nScotland, which was to review the Calculations made for the Equivalent\r\nto be paid to Scotland for bearing their share of the Debt of England,\r\nwhich were afterwards to be considered as the Debts of Great Britain.\r\nThese calculations were chiefly made by Doctor Gregory, professor of\r\nMathematicks in the College of Oxford, and a certain great accomptant\r\nand projector, one Patersone,[26] from Scotland, but bred in England\r\nfrom his infancy....\r\n\r\nOne day I had occasion to observe the Calamities which attend human\r\nnature even in the greatest dignities of Life. Her majesty was labouring\r\nunder a fit of the Gout, and in extream pain and agony, and on this\r\noccasion every thing about her was much in the same disorder as about\r\nthe meanest of her subjects. Her face, which was red and spotted, was\r\nrendered something frightful by her negligent dress, and the foot\r\naffected was tied up with a pultis and some nasty bandages. I was much\r\naffected at this sight, and the more _when she had occasion to mention\r\nher people of Scotland_, which she did frequently to the Duke. What are\r\nyou, poor meanlike Mortal, thought I, who talks in the style of a\r\nSoveraign? Nature seems to be inverted when a poor infirm Woman becomes\r\none of the Rulers of the World, but, as Tacitus observes, it is not the\r\nfirst time that Women have governed in Britain, and indeed they have\r\nsometimes done this to better purpose than the Men.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Treaty of Union, the Articles were at last agreed\r\nto, sign\u0027d, and sealed, by all the Commissioners, the 22 of July 1706.\r\nThey were afterwards presented to the Queen at her palace of S^t James,\r\nbefore a very numerous Assembley.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Founder of the Bank of England, and originator of the Darien\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. POPULAR HOSTILITY TO THE UNION (1706).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The History of the Union of Great Britain_, part iv., p.\r\n    27, by Daniel De Foe. (Edinburgh: 1709).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common people now screw\u0027d up to a pitch, and ripe for the mischief\r\ndesigned, and prompted by the particular agents of a wicked party, began\r\nto be very insolent: It had been whispered about several days, that the\r\nrabble would rise, and come up to the Parliament House; and cry No\r\nUnion; that they would take away the Honours, as they call them, viz.\r\nthe Crown etc., and carry them to the Castle, and a long variety of\r\nfoolish reports of this kind. But the first appearance of anything\r\nmobish was, that every day, when the Duke[27] went up, but principally\r\nas he came down in his chair from the House, the mob follow\u0027d him,\r\nshouting and crying out, GOD bless his Grace, for standing up against\r\nthe Union, and appearing for his country, and the like.... On the 22nd\r\nof October, they follow\u0027d the Duke\u0027s chair quite thro the city down to\r\nthe Abbey Gate; the guards prevented their going further; but all the\r\nway as they came back, they were heard to threaten what they would do\r\nthe next day; that then they would be a thousand times as many; that\r\nthey would pull the traitors, so they called the treaters of the Union\r\nat London, out of their houses, and they would soon put an end to the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd they made part of their words good indeed; for, as the\r\nParliament sat something late, the people gather\u0027d in the streets, and\r\nabout the doors of the Parliament House, and particularly the Parliament\r\nClose was almost full, that the members could not go in or out without\r\ndifficulty; when Duke Hamilton was coming out of the House, the mob\r\nhuzza\u0027d as formerly, and follow\u0027d his chair in a very great number; the\r\nDuke, instead of going down to the Abbey as usual, went up the High\r\nStreet to the Land-Market,[28] as they call it, and so to the lodgings\r\nof the Duke of Athole; some said, he went to avoid the mob; others\r\nmaliciously said, he went to point them to their work.\r\n\r\nWhile he went in to the Duke of Athole\u0027s lodgings, the rabble attended\r\nat the door; and, by shouting and noise, having increased their numbers\r\nto several thousands, they began with Sir Patrick Johnston, who was one\r\nof the treaters, and the year before had been Lord Provost; first they\r\nassaulted his lodgings with stones and sticks, and curses not a few; but\r\nhis windows being too high, they came up the stairs to his door, and\r\nfell to work at it with sledges, or great hammers; and, had they broke\r\nit open in their first fury, he had, without doubt, been torn in pieces\r\nwithout mercy; and thus only, because he was a treater in the commission\r\nto England; for, before that, no man was so well belov\u0027d, as he, over\r\nthe whole city.\r\n\r\nHis lady, in the utmost despair with this fright, comes to the window,\r\nwith two candles in her hand, that she might be known; and cried out,\r\nfor GOD\u0027S sake, to call the guards; an honest apothecary in the town,\r\nwho knew her voice, and saw the distress she was in, and to whom the\r\nfamily, under GOD, is obliged, for their deliverance, ran immediately\r\ndown to the town guard; but they would not stir, without the Lord\r\nProvost\u0027s order; but that being soon obtain\u0027d, one Captain Richardson,\r\nwho commanded, taking about thirty men with him, march\u0027d bravely up to\r\nthem; and making his way with great resolution thro the crowd, they\r\nflying, but throwing stones, and hallowing at him, and his men, he\r\nseized the foot of the stair case; and then boldly went up, clear\u0027d the\r\nstair, and took six of the rabble in the very act; and so delivered the\r\ngentleman and his family....\r\n\r\nThe city was now in a terrible fright, and every body was under concern\r\nfor their friends; the rabble went raving about the streets till\r\nmidnight, frequently beating drums, and raising more people; when my\r\nLord Commissioner being informed, there were a thousand of the seamen\r\nand rabble come up from Leith; and apprehending, if it were suffered to\r\ngo on, it might come to a dangerous head, and be out of his power to\r\nsuppress, he sent for the Lord Provost, and demanded, that the Guards\r\nshould march into the city.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Provost, after some difficulty, yielded; tho it was alleged,\r\nthat it was what was never known in Edinburgh before. About one o clock\r\nin the morning, a battalion of the Guards entered the town, marched up\r\nto the Parliament Close, and took post in all the avenues of the city,\r\nwhich prevented the resolutions taken to insult the houses of the rest\r\nof the treaters.\r\n\r\nThe rabble were intirely reduc\u0027d by this, and gradually dispers\u0027d, and\r\nso the tumult ended....\r\n\r\nThe author of this[29] had his share in the danger of this tumult, and\r\ntho unknown to him, was watch\u0027d and set by the mob, in order to know\r\nwhere to find him, had his chamber windows insulted, and the windows\r\nbelow him broken by mistake. But, by the prudence of his friends, the\r\nshortness of its continuance, and GOD\u0027S providence, he escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] Of Hamilton.

Second edition. (London: 1746.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mar, then at London, not finding how to form his own\r\ninterest at court, had resolved on those wicked and traitorous measures\r\nhe afterwards followed; and in order to raise and carry on the\r\nrebellion, had, by some means or other, received from abroad, no less\r\nthan the sum of one hundred thousand pounds sterling, together with\r\nletters and instructions under the Pretender\u0027s own hand, and a\r\ncommission appointing him Lieutenant-General and Commander in Chief of\r\nhis forces, as he called them, in Scotland: And fearing lest his\r\ntraitorous designs against his lawful sovereign prince,[50] to whom he\r\nhad so early and solemnly promised fidelity, might possibly be\r\ndiscovered, and he himself secured by the government, he resolved to\r\nmake a sudden tour into Scotland, as the likeliest mean to prevent this\r\nfate, and in order to make some speedy advances in this his pernicious\r\nand bloody undertaking. Wherefore on the 2nd of August, or as some say,\r\nthe 1st, in the evening, his lordship, in the dress of a private person,\r\nembark\u0027d with Major-General Hamilton, Colonel Hay, and two servants on\r\nboard of a collier in the Thames, and arriving in two or three days at\r\nNewcastle, hired there a vessel belonging to one Spence, which set him\r\nand his company on shore in the Ely, from whence he got over to\r\nCreil[51] in the shire of Fife. Soon after his landing he was attended\r\nby Sir Alexander Areskine, Lord Lyon, and others of his friends in Fife,\r\nto whom he made known the design of his coming, and then went forward to\r\nKinoul, where he staid on Wednesday the 17th, and on the 18th he passed\r\nthe river Tay, about two miles from Perth, with 40 horse on his way to\r\nthe north. Next day he sent letters to all the Jacobites round the\r\ncountry, inviting them to meet him in haste at Brae-Mar, where he\r\narrived on Saturday the 20th of August.\r\n\r\nThere is no room to doubt, that he had before-hand concerted measures\r\nwith them; and that they were previously advised of his coming, before\r\nhe arrived in Scotland: For, on Saturday the 6th of August, their\r\nfriends at Edinburgh were apprized of it; and early next morning Captain\r\nJohn Dalziel, a half-pay officer, who, in view of this rebellion had\r\nthrown up his commission to the Earl of Orkney, was sent out to give the\r\nalarm to his brother, the Earl of Carnwath, then at Elliock, where he\r\narrived that night; and, early next morning, expresses were sent to the\r\nEarl of Nithsdale, the Viscount of Kenmure, and others of their friends\r\nin those parts; the Earl himself went down that same day to meet them,\r\nin order to forward their measures; and after some time spent in\r\npreparing others, whose inclinations they knew, to embark with them in\r\nthat bloody project, they repaired to Lothian; and \u0027twas then given out,\r\nthat they were gone to a hunting in the north. This was indeed a\r\nplausible pretence for their getting to the Highlands, and the more that\r\nthe Earl of Mar, to cover his design, too black to be owned at the\r\nfirst, in calling the chiefs of the clans together, had proposed a\r\nhunting in his own country. Accordingly, in a few days after he arrived\r\nat Brae-Mar, he was there attended by a great number of gentlemen, of\r\nthe best quality and interest of all his party: And particularly at\r\ntheir Great Council, which was held about August 26, there appeared the\r\nMarquis of Huntley, eldest son to the Duke of Gordon; the Marquis of\r\nTullibardine, eldest son to the Duke of Athol; the Earls of Nithsdale,\r\nMarischal, Traquair, Errol, Southesk, Carnwath, Seaforth, Linlithgow,\r\nand several others; the Viscounts of Kilsith, Kenmure, Kingston and\r\nStormount; the Lords Rollo, Duffus, Drummond, Strathallan, Ogilvie and\r\nNairn, with a good many gentlemen of interest in the Highlands, amongst\r\nwhom were the two Generals, Hamilton and Gordon, Glenderule, Auldbair,\r\nAuchterhouse, Glengary, and others from the clans....\r\n\r\n... Moreover, we are told, that he shew\u0027d them the letters he had\r\nreceived from Lorraine, under the Pretender\u0027s own hand, promising to\r\ncome over to them in person, and put himself upon the valour and\r\nfidelity of his Scots subjects; and that in the mean time, they should\r\nbe sure of ships, with arms, ammunition, and all military stores, with\r\nofficers, engineers, and volunteers, as soon as they could give him an\r\naccount to what port they would direct them to be sent: As also, that he\r\nshew\u0027d them his commission under the Pretender\u0027s own hand, appointing\r\nhim Lieutenant-General, Commander in Chief, and Director of the War; and\r\nassur\u0027d them, that he was furnish\u0027d with money, and would, from time to\r\ntime, be supplied with sufficient sums to levy men, and to pay the\r\ntroops regularly that should be raised; so as no gentlemen should be at\r\nany expence to subsist their men, but that both they, and the country\r\nshould be eased of all such burthens.\r\n\r\nWith these and other such arguments, which he proposed unto them with a\r\npopular air, he at length prevailed upon them to embrace his project;\r\nand some say, they engaged by oath to stand by him, and one another, and\r\nto bring over their friends and dependants to do the like. However, the\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen did not immediately after this meeting draw\r\ntogether their men, but went every man back to his own estate, to take\r\ntheir measures for appearing in arms, when they should hear again from\r\nthe Earl of Mar, who remain\u0027d, in the mean time, in his own country,\r\nwith some few attendants only. These noblemen and gentlemen being\r\nreturned home, began to draw together their servants and dependants, in\r\nall the places where they had interest, making several pretences for\r\ndoing so, but did not discover the real design till things were in\r\nreadiness to break out. And indeed it was but a few days after, that the\r\nEarl of Mar summon\u0027d them all, at least such as were near at hand, to a\r\ngeneral meeting at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire, on the third of September,\r\nin order to concert farther measures for their appearing in arms: And\r\nhaving there directed the drawing together their forces without any loss\r\nof time, he returned to Brae-Mar, and continued some days gathering the\r\npeople, till their number was increased considerably; but the accounts\r\nbeing so various, while some say there were then two thousand men, most\r\nof them horse, and others but sixty, I shall not condescend on the\r\nparticular number: However, with those he had got together, he set up\r\nthe Pretender\u0027s Standard at Brae-Mar, on the sixth of September, 1715,\r\nand there proclaim\u0027d him King of Scotland, England, France, and Ireland,\r\netc. \u0027Tis reported, that when this standard was first erected, the ball\r\non the top of it fell off, which the superstitious Highlanders were very\r\nmuch concern\u0027d at, taking it as an omen of the bad success of the cause\r\nfor which they were then appearing, and indeed, the event has proven\r\nthat it was no less. Thereafter they went to a small town named\r\nKirkmichael, where having proclaim\u0027d the Pretender, and summon\u0027d the\r\npeople to attend his standard, they staid some few days, and then\r\nproceeded to Moulin, another small town in the shire of Perth, where\r\nthey likewise proclaim\u0027d him, and rested some short time, gathering\r\ntheir forces; and where by the coming in of others of their party, their\r\nnumber was considerably increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] George I.\r\n\r\n[51] Crail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. DEFENCE OF EDINBURGH (OCTOBER).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of the Life of Sir John Clerk of Penicuik,\r\n    Bart.: extracted by himself from his own Journals, 1676-1755_, p.\r\n    89. Edited by John M. Gray. (Edinburgh: Scottish Historical Society,\r\n    1892.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time it must be confessed that their courage and conduct in\r\nScotland far exceeded what was expected, for the Earl of Mar had so much\r\naddress as to bring to the town of Perth, the center of all the\r\nenterprise, at least 10,000 men, some have carried the number to 12,000,\r\nwhich _I_ am inclined to believe, provided the 1600 men be included that\r\npast the Frith of Forth near the Island of May, of which hereafter.\r\n\r\nDuring these convulsions in my native country, I was obliged to change\r\nmy course of living and turn a military man, for being appointed one of\r\nthe Lieutenants of the Shire of Edin., I was obliged to act my part in\r\nbringing the militia together. These consisted of a few men, horse and\r\nfoot, who never continued 3 days together, and signified nothing in the\r\nmilitary way, the lowland men being a great deal more unfit for warlike\r\nexpeditions than the Highlanders who had joined the Earl of Mar.\r\nHowever, with these militia troops we sometimes made a show, and perhaps\r\nthey served to intimidate those who knew nothing about them. They were\r\nparticularly useful and active when the Highlanders above mentioned past\r\nthe Forth and were marching to take possession of Edin., for being drawn\r\nup on the high way a mile east of Edin., where these Highlanders were to\r\nmarch in order to take possession of the town, they found themselves\r\nobliged to turn to the right and take possession of the citadel of\r\nLieth, the ----[52] of October, 1715.\r\n\r\nThat same night, to the joy of the inhabitants of Edin., who expected to\r\nbe plundered by the Highlanders, the Duke of Argyll arrived from\r\nStirling with 200 chosen foot and 300 dragoons, the foot mounted on\r\ncountry horses for more expedition. Next morning the Deputy Lieutenants\r\nand all the well affected to the Government of K. George waited on him,\r\nand immediately he ordered all his troops to march down with him to the\r\nattaque of the Citadel of Lieth.\r\n\r\nI waited on his Grace, and we never halted till we were within 300 paces\r\nof that place. Here all our men were drawn up in 2 lines for the\r\nattaque. The foot in the center, and the horse on the wings, our number\r\nwas as follows. 300 Dragoons, 200 Regular foot, about 200 of the Town\r\nGuards of Edin., and about 500 volunteers, with a regiment of militia.\r\nThese amounting in all to about 1500 men, were drawn up on the crofts to\r\nthe westward of the citadel. There were likeways two regiments of\r\nmilitia from the shires of Merse and Teviotdale, who were drawn up on\r\nthe Links on the south side of the town to prevent the Highlanders from\r\nescaping.\r\n\r\nThe Duke called a Council of War, consisting of the principal officers\r\npresent, in sight of the enemy, here it was debated in what manner to\r\nattaque the citadel, for the duke had never seen it, and the issue was\r\nthat in regard we had neither cannon, bombs, nor granads, it was\r\nimpossible to do anything to purpose, for that our men would be\r\ndestroied by the fire of the enemy before they came near the ramparts,\r\nfor altho\u0027 these ramparts and bastions were ruined ever since the days\r\nof Oliver Cromwell, who about the years 1654 and 1655 ordered them to be\r\nrepaired out of the old fortifications of Lieth, yet they were\r\nsufficient against such a body of men as we were who came there to\r\nattaque them. On these considerations we were obliged to return to the\r\ntown in a very disconsolet manner.\r\n\r\nThe Duke might have been informed of the condition of that place before\r\nhe marched there, but he thought nothing in Scotland, except castles,\r\nimpregnable to his troops, and we who knew the citadel never doubted but\r\ndismounted Dragoons cou\u0027d force the place sword in hand. The next thing\r\nto be done was to provide artillery from the Castle of Edin., in order\r\nto attaque the citadel next day, but that night the Highlanders, who\r\nwere under the command of one Brigadier Macintosh, marched off to\r\nSeaton House, where they staid 3 or 4 days. Here several detachments\r\nwere sent out of Edin. to attaque them, but being without cannon we\r\ncou\u0027d do nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] 14th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE BATTLE OF SHERIFFMUIR (NOVEMBER).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_A Fragment of a Memoir of Field-Marshal James Keith:\r\n    written by himself, 1714-1734_, p. 16. (Edinburgh: Spalding Club,\r\n    1843.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll our troops being now assembled, the Earl of Mar resolved to march\r\ntowards the enemy, and on the eighth of November arrived at Denain,[53]\r\nwith fourteen battalions of foot and eight squadrons of horse, having\r\nleft three battalions in Perth for the defence of the place; the ninth\r\nthe army lay at Auchterarder, where he reviewed the troops, who\r\nconsisted of about 6000 foot and eight hundred horse. Here we lay two\r\ndays, waiting for two battalions from Fife; but finding these did not\r\ncome up so soon as we expected, the twelfth we continued our march, the\r\nadvanced guard lay near Dumblain, and the rest of the troops were\r\nquarter\u0027d about a mile behind them, the want of tents and the coldness\r\nof the weather rendering it impossible for us to encamp. We had as yet\r\nno perfect account of the motions of the enemy, and concluded from the\r\ninferiority of their number (they being not above 3000 foot and twelve\r\nhundred horse), that they would fight us at the passage of the river,\r\nbut we had hardly got the troops marched to their different quarters,\r\nwhen we received orders to join with all haste our advanced guard, the\r\nDuke of Argile having passed the Forth, and encamped about the toun of\r\nDumblain, within cannon shot of them. Both armies lay all night on their\r\narms, and next morning by day break we discover\u0027d a body of the enemies\r\non a rising ground near our left. Before eight in the morning, our army\r\nwas formed in order of battle, in two lines, without any body of\r\nreserve. The Earl of Mar call\u0027d all the general officers and heads of\r\nclans to a council of war, which was held at the head of the line, and\r\nthere asked their advice whither we should attack the enemy, or return\r\nto Perth and wait the arrival of King James, who was every day\r\nexpected, as also for accounts what success our friends in England might\r\nhave; but it was carried almost unanimously to attack, none daring\r\nopenly to oppose the current; the Marquis of Huntly only made some\r\ninsinuations that it would not be fit to remain in unaction till the\r\nKing\u0027s arrival.\r\n\r\nThe resolution being now taken to attack the enemy, the Earl of Mar\r\ncommanded the Earl Marischal, with Sir Donald M\u0027Donald\u0027s regiment of\r\nfoot, and his own squadron of horse, to take possession of the rising\r\nground on which a body of the enemies horse still remain\u0027d, and to cover\r\nthe march of the army on the left (our right being cover\u0027d by a river)\r\nto the toun of Dumblain, where we imagined the enemy still to be. On our\r\napproach, the enemies horse retired; and we had no sooner gained the top\r\nof the hill than we discover\u0027d their whole body, marching without beat\r\nof drum, about two musket shot from us. It was now too late to retreat;\r\nwe therfor form\u0027d on the top of the hill, and the Earl Marischal sent an\r\naid-de-camp to advertise the Earl of Mar that he was fallen in with the\r\nenemies army, that it was impossible for him to bring off the foot, and\r\ntherfor desired he would march up to his assistance as quick as\r\npossible,--which he did even in too much haste; for the army, which\r\nmarched in four columns, arrived in such confusion that it was\r\nimpossible to form them according to the line of battle projected, every\r\none posted himself as he found ground, and one column of foot enclining\r\nto the right and another to the left of the Earl Marischal\u0027s squadron of\r\nhorse, that regiment which should have been on the right, found itself\r\nin the center, separated from the rest of the horse, and opposed to the\r\nenemies foot; our foot formed all in one line, except on the left, where\r\na bog hinder\u0027d them from extending themselves, and encreased the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argile was no less embarrassed on his side. His army was not\r\nyet entirely formed; the rear, which was to have formed his left wing,\r\nwas yet on their march, and showed us their flanck, which being observed\r\nby Lieutenant General Gordon, he order\u0027d our troops immediately to\r\ncharge, which they did with so much vigour that in less than ten\r\nminutes they entirely defeated six regiments of foot and five squadrons\r\nof dragoons, which composed more than the half of the Duke\u0027s army, while\r\nthe rest having taken the same advantage of our left, which had neither\r\ntime nor ground to fire, entirely routed them. Both parties pursued the\r\ntroops they had broken, not knowing what had happen\u0027d on the other side,\r\ntill at length the Earl of Mar, having had the fatal news of the loss we\r\nhad receiv\u0027d, order\u0027d the troops to give over the pursuit, and having\r\nrallied them, returned to the field of battle, from whence we discover\u0027d\r\nthe enemy posted at the foot of the hill amongst mud walls, on the same\r\nground where we had layen the night before.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mar sent immediately an officer to reconnoitre them, and at\r\nthe same time assembled the General officers and heads of clans, to\r\nconsult whether he should attack them again; but the officer having\r\nreported that their numbers were equal to ours, and the Highlanders, who\r\nwere extreamly fatigued, and had eat nothing in two days, being averse\r\nto it, it was resolved to keep the field of battle, and to let the enemy\r\nretire unmolested, which they had already began to do under cover of the\r\nearth walls, as well as of the night which was now approaching, leaving\r\nus about fifty prisoners of ours, most of them wounded, whom they had\r\nnot time to carry along with them. We continued on the field of battle\r\ntill dark night, and then marched back to the same villages which had\r\nbeen marked for our quarters the night before.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had about seven hundred men killed or wounded, amongst whom\r\nwas the Earl of Forfar killed, and the Earl of Islay wounded, and two\r\nhundred and twenty-three taken prisoners, and we had about 150 killed or\r\nwounded, and eighty-two taken; but among those killed we had three\r\npersons of note, the Earl of Strathmore, his unkle Auchterhouse, and\r\nClanronald, and the Earl of Panmure very much wounded. The loss of\r\ncolours was almost equal on both sides; but the enemy got five piece of\r\nour cannon, which we could not carry off, those belonging to the train\r\nhaving run away with the horses when they saw our left broke; and thus\r\nended the affair of Dumblain, in which neither side gained much honour,\r\nbut which was the entire ruin of our party.\r\n\r\nSome unlucky mistakes which happened that day, must here take place;\r\nfirst, an order to the whole horse on the left to march to the right,\r\nwhich so discouraged the foot of that wing to see themselves abandoned,\r\nthat to it may be attributed their shameful behaviour that day; nor were\r\nthese horse of any advantage to us where they were posted, for the\r\nground was so bad that they could never be brought to engage. Another,\r\nof no less consequence, was the mistake of the officer who was sent to\r\nreconnoitre the Duke of Argile\u0027s army in the afternoon, for he having\r\ntaken his remarks more by the number of colours than the space of ground\r\nthey occupied, made his report that the enemy was betwixt two and three\r\nthousand foot strong, when in reality there was no more than three\r\nbattalions, not making in all above one thousand foot, the other colours\r\nbeing what the Duke had just taken on our left, and being almost the\r\nsame with his own, he now used them to disguise the weakness of his\r\ntroops by making a show of four battalions more than he had, the ground\r\nand mud walls by which he was cover\u0027d not allowing to see that he had\r\nformed only two ranks deep; this mistake hinder\u0027d us from attacking him\r\nin the evening, which it\u0027s probable we might have done with better\r\nsuccess than we had in the morning.\r\n\r\nNext morning the Duke of Mar, finding most of our left had run quite\r\naway and was not yet returned, retired towards Perth, as the enemy had\r\nalready done into Stirling.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] Dunning, in Perthshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. THE OLD PRETENDER (DECEMBER).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of the Insurrection in Scotland in 1715, by\r\n    John, Master of Sinclair_, p. 333. Edited from the original\r\n    manuscript by Sir Walter Scott, Bart. (Edinburgh: Abbotsford Club,\r\n    1848.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore these had come to Huntlie,[54] the King was already landed at\r\nPeterhead, the twenty-seventh day of September[55] [December], and was\r\nin his road to Fetteresso, where he halted. We were not long of hearing\r\nfrom those who came from the South that a young gentleman had passed\r\nAberdeen with Captain Allan Cameron; that they had gone straight to\r\nFetteresso, and it was thought that young man was the King; Cameron was\r\ngone on post to Perth, and the other was left at Fetteresso privately.\r\nThis made Huntlie send a gentleman to Aberdeen with orders to go on till\r\nhe got the certain account. By the time he got there, he was certainly\r\ninformed the King was arrived, and that Mar was already at Fetteresso.\r\nTo do Huntlie justice, being present when he received the news, he said,\r\n\"Now ther\u0027s no help for it, we must all ruin with him: would to God he\r\nhad comed sooner.\" There seem\u0027d still some faint hopes to remain, which\r\nwere, that since his Majestie had stopt at Fetteresso, and keept himself\r\nincognito there for two days, till Captain Cameron had informed Mar of\r\nhis arrival, his reason for it could only be that he wanted to know the\r\nstate of his affairs before he\u0027d go forward to Perth; for what other\r\nreason could have hinder\u0027d him to [have] declared himself at Aberdeen,\r\nor from going straight to Perth? And by all that could be learned since,\r\nwe found we judged right; for it\u0027s said, that if his affairs were on a\r\nbad foot, he was resolved to return without loss of time, and leave his\r\npoor subjects the freedom of making terms for themselves; a very just\r\nand reasonable thought. Whatever was in it, as his declaring himself at\r\nFetteresso, and afterwards going up to Perth, put a stop to all thoughts\r\nof terms on our side, so it\u0027s not to be doubted that the Government,\r\nhowever inclinable they might [have] been before, could ever entertain\r\nor allow of any such proposals from those inclined to mercy, or the\r\nmoderate people of their own side....\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mar, who, as we first supposed, would [have] met his Majesty\r\nprivately, spread the news at Perth of the King\u0027s happy landing, and\r\nbrought a numerous train with him to Fetteresso, out of a view, I\r\nbelieve, to put it out of his Majesty\u0027s power to go back, having already\r\npublished his being there; and to confirm him of the certainty of his\r\naffairs succeeding, by the approbation of those villainous, weak,\r\nmiserable, deluded dependers of his Lordship, who he brought along with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n... Thus that unhappy Prince, entirely a stranger to his own affairs, as\r\nmuch as he had dropt out of another world, or from the clouds, as things\r\nstood, was brought in eminent danger of his life, without its being\r\npossible that it could have any other effect but that of the certain\r\nruin of his friends, and driving the nail to the head, and riveting the\r\nmisery of those who had so generously sacrificed all to serve him. It\u0027s\r\ncertain that he was made believe that his affairs in general were on a\r\ngood foot, at least, very retrievable; that there were twice as many in\r\nPerth as there really were; and that there was no more needful to be\r\ndone but the taking of Inverness, which entirely depended on Huntlie;\r\nand when that was done, the King would have a great army from all places\r\nof the Highlands before the Duke of Argyle could attack Perth. As for\r\npowder, I suppose it was never spoke of, since there was no want of it\r\nat Fetteresso; that the news of his Majestie\u0027s arrival would no sooner\r\nspread but all would return, and great numbers who had joined them would\r\ncome from different corners.... The King was carried triumphinglie up to\r\nPerth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] The Marquis of Huntly.\r\n\r\n[55] It should be the 22nd of December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. COLLAPSE OF THE REBELLION (1716).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The History of the Rebellion rais\u0027d against His Majesty\r\n    King George I. by the Friends of the Popish Pretender_, p. 365, by\r\n    the Rev. Mr. Peter Rae. Second edition. (London: 1746.)\r\n\r\n\r\n... His Grace[56] having received positive orders from Court, to march\r\nforthwith against the rebels, he resolved to surmount all difficulties,\r\nand to march as soon as the artillery, and some of the Dutch forces at\r\nEdinburgh, and the regiments of Newton and Stanhope, who were quartered\r\nat Glasgow, could come up to join him; which they did, two or three days\r\nafter.... The news of these preparations and march were not grateful to\r\nHis Majesty at Scone, spoiling the ceremony of his coronation, and\r\nmeeting of his Parliament: Instead of which fine things, the only matter\r\nnow under consideration was, how to provide for their own safety; and\r\nthe grand question debated was, whether to maintain the place, and fight\r\nthe Duke of Argyle, or retreat.... The Pretender, finding that time was\r\nnot to be lost, retired that evening from Scone to Perth, where having\r\nsupped at Provost Hay\u0027s, he rested some hours; and next morning[57]\r\nabout ten o\u0027clock, the rebels abandoned Perth, marching over the Tay\r\nupon the ice, and, leaving their cannon behind them, took their rout\r\ntowards Dundee. About noon the Pretender himself, with the Earl of Mar,\r\nfollowed his flying adherents with tears in his eyes, complaining that\r\ninstead of bringing him to a Crown, they had brought him to his\r\ngrave....\r\n\r\nThe rebels having retired from Dundee to Montrose, his Grace, on the\r\n3rd,[58] sent a detachment towards Aberbrothick[59] within eight miles\r\nof that place; and on the fourth, in the morning, ordered Major General\r\nSabine, with 3 battalions, 500 detached foot, and 50 dragoons, to march\r\nto Aberbrothick. The same day his Grace detached Colonel Clayton with\r\n300 foot and 50 dragoons, to march by the way of Brechin; giving orders\r\nto the one as well as the other to summon the country people to remove\r\nthe snow on the roads, which, being then very deep, made their march\r\nvery heavy and tedious. His Grace having divided the rest of his army\r\ninto two bodies, for marching with the greater expedition; and the rebel\r\narmy having marched in two columns, on the 5th, in the morning, General\r\nCadogan with the infantry marched towards Aberbrothick, and at the same\r\ntime the Duke himself, with all the cavalry, proceeded by the Upper Road\r\ntowards Brechin; the whole army being to join the next day at\r\nStonehive,[60] intending on Tuesday hereafter to be at Aberdeen, to\r\nwhich place they supposed the Pretender was gone.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the Pretender was out of their reach; for having\r\nreceived advice at Montrose, on the 4th of February, about four in the\r\nafternoon, that part of the King\u0027s army was advancing towards\r\nAberbrothick, he ordered the clans who remained with him to be ready to\r\nmarch, about eight at night, towards Aberdeen, where he assured them a\r\nconsiderable force would soon come to them from France. At the hour\r\nappointed for their march, the Pretender ordered his horses to be\r\nbrought before the door of the house in which he lodged, and the guard\r\nwhich usually attended him to mount, as if he designed to go on with the\r\nclans to Aberdeen; but at the same time he slipped privately out on\r\nfoot, accompanied only by one of his domesticks, went to the Earl of\r\nMar\u0027s lodgings, and from thence, by a byway to the water-side, where a\r\nboat waited and carried him and the Earl of Mar on board a French ship\r\nof 90 tuns, called the _Maria Teresa_ of St. Malo. About a quarter of an\r\nhour after, two other boats carried the Earl of Melford and the Lord\r\nDrummond, with Lieutenant-General Sheldon and ten other gentlemen on\r\nboard the same ship, and then they hoisted sail and put to sea; and\r\nnotwithstanding of his Majesty\u0027s ships that were cruising on that coast,\r\ngot safely off, and in seven days landed at Waldam, near Graveling,[61]\r\nbetween Dunkirk and Calais. The Earls Marischal, Southesk, the Lord\r\nTinmouth, General Gordon, with many other gentlemen and officers of\r\ndistinction, were left behind to shift for themselves, who kept with the\r\narmy, and continued their march towards Aberdeen, the foot marching on\r\nbefore with General Gordon, and the Earl Marischal, with about 1000\r\nhorse, keeping the rear to prevent surprise....\r\n\r\nThe same day the King\u0027s forces advanced to Montrose, the remains of the\r\nrebel army arrived at Aberdeen, where General Gordon showed them a\r\nletter from the Pretender, in which he acquainted his friends that the\r\ndisappointments he had met with, especially from abroad, had obliged him\r\nto leave that country; that he thanked them for their services, and\r\ndesired them to advise with General Gordon, and consult their own\r\nsecurity either by keeping in a body or separating, and encouraging them\r\nto expect to hear farther from him in a very short time.... And we are\r\ntold, that upon reading of the letter, many of the people threw down\r\ntheir arms, crying out they were basely betrayed, they were all undone,\r\nthey were left without king or general. On the seventh, in the morning,\r\nthe van of the rebels marched from Aberdeen, as did their rear about two\r\nin the afternoon, and their main body lay at Old Meldrum that night; but\r\nabout 200 of their horse, amongst whom were many of their chiefs, with\r\nIrish and other officers who came lately from France, went toward\r\nPeterhead in order to ship themselves off in ships which they knew were\r\nwaiting for them there....\r\n\r\nTheir main body marched straight west, through Strath-Spey and\r\nStrath-Don to the hills of Badenoch, where they separated: The foot\r\ndispersed into the mountains on this side of Lochy, and the horse went\r\nLochquhaher, agreeing, however, to meet again upon notice from the\r\nPretender. And here being advised that two French frigates were come for\r\ntheir relief, and would lay in Pentland Firth till they should hear from\r\nthem, the Lord Duffus, Sir George Sinclair, General Eckline and others,\r\nabout 160 gentlemen in all, well mounted on horseback, made a sally from\r\nthe hills, and crossing the shire of Murray,[62] came to the seaside\r\nnear Burgh, where they got several large barks which carried them to the\r\nOrkneys, Arskerry,[63] and other of the islands, from whence most of\r\nthem found means to get into the frigates which carried them safe to\r\nFrance. Other ships coming afterwards carried the rest to Gottenburg, in\r\nthe Swedish dominions, where some of them took on in that king\u0027s\r\nservice.... There were yet with the rebels in Scotland many of their\r\nchiefs, as the Marquis of Tullibardine, the Earls Marischal, Southesk,\r\nLinlithgow, and Seaforth, who having broke his submission, joined them\r\nagain in their flight to the northward, the Lord Tinmouth, Sir Donald\r\nM\u0027Donald, and several others of the heads of the clans, who sheltered\r\nthemselves for some time in the mountains from his Majesty\u0027s troops who\r\npursued them through the north; and from thence some made their escape\r\nto the Isle of Sky, the Lewis, and other of the north-western islands\r\ntill ships came for their relief to carry them abroad; and some of them\r\nafterwards submitted to the Government, as we shall hear below....\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyle having thus gloriously finished the most laborious\r\nand hard campaign that ever was known, he left the command of his\r\nMajesty\u0027s troops to Lieutenant-General Cadogan and returned to\r\nEdinbourgh the 27th of February, and in a day or two after set out for\r\nLondon, where he arrived on the 6th of March.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] Of Argyle.\r\n\r\n[57] January 30.\r\n\r\n[58] Of February.\r\n\r\n[59] Arbroath.\r\n\r\n[60] Stonehaven.\r\n\r\n[61] Gravelines.\r\n\r\n[62] Moray.\r\n\r\n[63] Eriska.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF.

(London: 1815.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. LXXII.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous letter, written by Mr. Duncan Forbes to Sir Robert Walpole,\r\nmost likely in August 1716--a copy is extant (from which the present is\r\ntaken) in the President\u0027s handwriting.\r\n\r\nSir, ... When the late Rebellion was happily ended by the Pretender\u0027s\r\nflight, his deluded followers found themselves all in chains, or obliged\r\nto surrender and sue for mercy, or to fly their country with him. Every\r\nman concerned in that odious work certainly deserved death, and the\r\npunishment due by law; but humanity and prudence forbade it. It was not\r\nfit to dispeople a country; nor prudent to grieve the King\u0027s best\r\nfriends, who mostly had some concern in those unfortunate men; or\r\nexpedient to give too just grounds of clamour to the disaffected.\r\n\r\nIt will be agreed on all hands, that the proper rule in this case would\r\nhave been, to have punished only as many as was necessary for terror,\r\nand for weakening the strength of the rebels for the future; and to\r\nextend mercy to as many as it could conveniently be indulged to with the\r\nsecurity of the Government; and this maxim every thinking Whig had then\r\nin his mouth, however offended at the insolences of the rebels. In place\r\nof a course of this kind, the method followed was, 1st, to try all the\r\ncriminals in England; 2dly, to detain in prison all those in custody in\r\nScotland, except some who had interest with certain great men to obtain\r\na previous pardon, to the manifest dishonour of the Government; 3dly, to\r\nattaint a vast number of Scots noblemen and gentlemen; 4thly, to put it\r\nout of his Majesty\u0027s power to grant any part of estates forfeited; and\r\n5thly, to appoint a Commission for enquiry, and levying the rebels\u0027\r\ngoods and chattels. The necessary consequences of this procedure in\r\ngeneral are two; first, it makes all those who had the misfortune to be\r\nseduced into the rebellion, with their children, relatives, and such as\r\ndepend on them, forever desperate; and it\u0027s hard to tell what occasions\r\nmay offer for venting their rage. We see that want and hard\r\ncircumstances lead men daily into follies, without any other temptation;\r\nbut when those circumstances are brought on by adherence to any\r\nprinciple, or opinion, it\u0027s certain the sufferers will not quit their\r\nattempts to better their condition, but with their lives. 2d, as there\r\nare none of the rebels who have not friends among the King\u0027s faithful\r\nsubjects, it is not easy to guess how far a severity of this kind,\r\nunnecessarily pushed, may alienate the affections even of those from the\r\nGovernment. But in particular, as this case relates to Scotland, the\r\ndifficulty will be insurmountable. I may venture to say, there are not\r\n200 gentlemen in the whole kingdom who are not very nearly related to\r\nsome one or other of the rebels. Is it possible that a man can see his\r\ndaughter, his grandchildren, his nephews, or cousins, reduced to beggary\r\nand starving unnecessarily by a Government, without thinking very ill of\r\nit; and where this is the case of a whole nation, I tremble to think\r\nwhat dissatisfactions it will produce against a settlement so necessary\r\nfor the happiness of Britain.\r\n\r\nIf all the rebels, with their wives, children, and immediate dependants,\r\ncould be at once rooted out of the earth, the shock would be\r\nastonishing; but time would commit it to oblivion, and the danger would\r\nbe less to the Constitution, than when thousands of innocents, punished\r\nwith misery and want for the offences of their friends, are suffered to\r\nwander about the country, sighing out their complaints to Heaven, and\r\ndrawing at once the compassion and moving the indignation of every human\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTISH CAPITAL.[64]\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_A Journey through Scotland, in Familiar Letters from a\r\n    Gentleman here, to his Friend Abroad_, p. 65, by J. Macky. Second\r\n    edition. (London: 1729.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe High-Street of Edinburgh, running by an easy ascent from the\r\nNetherbow to the Castle, a good half mile, is doubtless the stateliest\r\nstreet in the world, being broad enough for five coaches to drive up\r\nabreast; and the houses on each side are proportionately high to the\r\nbroadness of the street; all of them six or seven story high, and those\r\nmostly of free stone, makes this street very august.\r\n\r\nHalf way up this street stands St. Giles\u0027s Church, the ancient cathedral\r\nof this city, in the form of a cross; but since the Reformation it is\r\nturned into four convenient churches, by partitions, called the\r\nHigh-Kirk, the Old-Kirk, the Tolbooth-Kirk, and Haddock\u0027s Hole. A-top of\r\nthis church is erected a large open cupola, in the shape of an imperial\r\ncrown, that is a great ornament to the city, and seen at a great\r\ndistance. King David erected a copy after this over St. Nicholas\u0027s\r\nChurch in Newcastle, but it does not near come up to it. Besides these\r\nfour churches of St. Giles\u0027s, there is in the same street a little lower\r\nthe Trone[65] Church, built after the model of Inigo Jones\u0027s St. Paul\u0027s\r\nCovent Garden; a very handsome church at the east end of the lake,\r\ncalled the Collegiate Church, built by Mary of Gelder,[66] Queen to\r\nJames the Second; a church built by a Lady Yester, a handsome new church\r\nin the middle of the Canongate, and two good churches under the same\r\nroof at the Grey-Friars. There are also some chapels; but they are\r\nconverted into halls for trades.\r\n\r\nTo the south of St. Giles\u0027s Church is a fine square, with an equestrian\r\nstatue of King Charles the Second in the middle. In this square stands\r\nthe Parliament-House, where their parliaments were kept: Also the\r\nCouncil and Treasury, and all other publick offices. It\u0027s a fine modern\r\nbuilding of free-stone, finished by Charles the First in 1636.\r\nUnderneath this building is kept the lawyer\u0027s library[67]; where there\r\nis a fine collection of books, of medals, and of ancient coins, the\r\nlargest of English and Scots coins I ever saw. I could not perceive that\r\nthe Scots bore the lion rampant in a tressor of Flower-de-Luces[68] on\r\nthe coins, till the Stewarts.\r\n\r\nJoining to this library is the Register, where are kept all the deeds\r\nand securities of the nation, as a common bank. Here is also a very good\r\nbank for money,[69] whose notes go current all over the nation. There is\r\nalso a fine room in this square for the meeting of the royal boroughs,\r\nadorned with pictures.\r\n\r\nIn this great street are several stone fountains of water, brought in\r\npipes at three miles distance, disposed at convenient distances to\r\nsupply the whole city with water; and on each side of this street are\r\nlanes, or wynds as they are called here, that run down to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThis made an English gentleman, that was here with the Duke of York,\r\nmerrily compare it to a double wooden comb, the great street the wood in\r\nthe middle, and the teeth of each side the lanes.\r\n\r\nThese lanes lead you to a street below, called the Cowgate, which runs\r\nthe whole length east and west of the other, but is neither half so\r\nbroad or well built. The High Street is also the best paved street I\r\never saw. I will not except Florence. One would think the stones inlaid;\r\nthey are not half a foot square; and notwithstanding the coaches and\r\ncarts, there is not the least crack in it.\r\n\r\nSouth from the Cowgate lies the High-School for Latin, and in its yard\r\nis kept a fine bagnio, in a handsome neat house, built for the Company\r\nof Surgeons; and in their hall is the picture of the late Duke Hamilton,\r\nEarl Finlater in his Chancellor\u0027s robes, and of all the eminent surgeons\r\nof the town, to the number of about forty, all originals, by Sir John\r\nMedina. There is also a pretty garden before and behind the house.\r\nDirectly north from this, on the other side of the Cowgate, is the\r\nPhysicians Hall and garden, where they have a noble museum, founded by\r\nSir Andrew Balfour, physician. The learned and industrious Sir Robert\r\nSebald has very much augmented it. It contains a treasure of curiosities\r\nof art and nature, foreign and domestick, as appears by Sir Robert\u0027s\r\naccount, printed in four books in 1697.\r\n\r\nA little further to the south of the Cowgate is the University, which\r\nconsists only of one college: The Magistrates of Edinburgh are governors\r\nof it; it hath a principal or warden, and four philosophy regents or\r\nprofessors. There is also a professor of Divinity, of Civil Law, of\r\nHistory, Mathematicks, and Hebrew.\r\n\r\nIn studying four years at this college you commence Master of Arts: The\r\nscholars are not in commons, and kept to strict rules as in the colleges\r\nin England, nor wear gowns; they lodge and diet in the town, as at the\r\ncolleges in Holland, and are required to attend at their several classes\r\nfrom eight in the morning till twelve, and from two to four. I wonder\r\nhow a college in a town used to so much business and diversion to take\r\noff from the study of youth, should ever produce a good scholar.\r\n\r\nThis college consists of two lower courts, and one upper one, tolerably\r\nwell built; the upper court, to which you ascend by steps of stairs, is\r\nlarger than the other two. On the left of that court is the library, a\r\nlong spacious room, and the books neatly kept, and cloistered with doors\r\nof wire, that none can open but the keeper, more commodious than the\r\nmultitude of chains used in the English libraries. The several\r\nbenefactions are kept in distinct apartments, with the donor\u0027s name\r\nover them in gold letters; and over these cases of books are pictures\r\nof most of the Kings of Scotland, and of all the reformers both at home\r\nand abroad....\r\n\r\nJoining to the College is a neat hospital for girls, with a pretty\r\ngarden, and bowling-green; and a little further is the churchyard of the\r\nGrey-Friars, the burial-place of all the eminent burghers of the city;\r\nfor they don\u0027t affect so much as the English to be buried in churches;\r\nthat they think smells too much of the Popish stamp....\r\n\r\nTo the westward of this church-yard stands the most celebrated Hospital\r\nof George Herriot, Jeweller to James the Sixth, for the bringing up of\r\n130 poor boys, children of decayed merchants and tradesmen of this city.\r\nThe building exceeds any thing of the kind in Europe. Sutton\u0027s Hospital,\r\ncalled the Charter-House at London, is a noble foundation; but the house\r\nneither of that, Christ-Church, nor anything of the kind at Rome or\r\nVenice, comes up to the magnificence of this building; which I suppose\r\nis owing to Dr. Balcanqual, his executor, who was a great architect, was\r\nDean of Rochester, and helped King James the Sixth to write his\r\nBasilicon Doron, and was left in full power by Mr. Herriot to build this\r\nhospital, which he hath done more like a princely palace than a\r\nhabitation for necessitous children....\r\n\r\nTo the north of Herriot\u0027s work, from whence its fine avenue ascends, and\r\nto the west of the Cowgate, is the Grass-Market, like Smithfield at\r\nLondon, where they sell their horses, corn and hay, and is as spacious\r\nas Smithfield is; and from it is the West Port or Gate, out of which is\r\na large suburb, as it is at most of the others. The City of Edinburgh is\r\na good English mile from the Palace to the Castle in a direct line; and\r\ntaking in the suburbs called the West-Port, Bristol,[70] Paterrow,[71]\r\nPleasants,[72] Canongate, and Calton, may be four miles in\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\nThis Grass-Market, or Smithfield, lies directly under the Castle, which\r\nis built on a high rock at the west end of the city, and over-looks and\r\ncommands it. The rock on which this castle is built is inaccessible on\r\nall sides, except just the front from the town, which rises by an easy\r\nascent on the ridge of the hill all the way from the Palace: However,\r\nthis front is secured by a half-moon, at least 200 feet perpendicularly\r\nhigh, well stored with artillery, besides other lower works towards the\r\ngate, that make it impregnable. There is also a royal palace in this\r\ncastle, finely built of free-stone, with very noble apartments; in one\r\nof which, King James the sixth of Scotland, and first of England, was\r\nborn. You may imagine the prospect, very delicious and unbounded from\r\nsuch a height as this; for you not only see all Edinburgh under you, but\r\nthe whole course of the firth from the Bass to Stirling; the coasts of\r\nFife on the other side of the sea, and many score miles into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] Edinburgh appeared much like this during the first half of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[65] Tron.\r\n\r\n[66] Gueldres.\r\n\r\n[67] Advocates\u0027 Library.\r\n\r\n[68] _Fleurs-de-lis._\r\n\r\n[69] See p. 18.\r\n\r\n[70] Bristo.\r\n\r\n[71] Potterrow.\r\n\r\n[72] Pleasance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JACOBITE ATTEMPT OF 1719.\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_A Fragment of a Memoir of Field-Marshal James Keith,\r\n    written by himself, 1714-1734_, p. 35. (Edinburgh: Spalding Club,\r\n    1843.)\r\n\r\n\r\n... To explain the reasons that now carried me to Spain, its necessary\r\nto go back to the month of August of this year,[73] when the English,\r\nwithout any previous declaration of war, or even any good ground for it,\r\nhad attacked the King of Spain\u0027s fleet on the coast of Sicily, and\r\nentirely ruined it, which so exasperated the Cardinal Alberoni, who then\r\ngoverned Spain with the title of first Minister, that he resolv\u0027d to\r\nassist King James, and so revenge himself on the Whigs, who had been the\r\noccasion of the breach of faith he complained of.... One difficulty\r\nstill remain\u0027d,--which was to get the chiefs of the King\u0027s friends, who\r\nwere in France, advertised of this, which the Cardinal desired me to\r\nundertake. The Earl Marischal had brought with him from the Duke of\r\nOrmonde a little billet containing these words--\"Pray have entire\r\nconfidence in the bearer,\" and signed Ormond, to be given to him who\r\nshould be sent; and with this and about 18,000 crowns, I set out from\r\nMadrid the 19 of February,[74] and three days after arrived at St.\r\nSebastian, where I deliver\u0027d 12,000 crowns to the Prince Campo Florido,\r\nfor the equipment of the frigats destin\u0027d for Scotland, and with the\r\nlittle money which remain\u0027d entered France privately....\r\n\r\nAll things being now ready, we embark\u0027d the 19th of March in a small\r\nbarck of about 25 tunns, in the mouth of the Seine, and shaped our\r\ncourse to pass betwixt Dover and Calais, and so round the Orkneys to the\r\nIsle of Lewis, which was our place of rendezvous; but the wind\r\ncontinuing at east forced us the Friday after, March 24, to alter our\r\ncourse, and stand away for St. George\u0027s Channel, or the back of Ireland,\r\nas we should think best.... From thence we stood for Cape Clear and the\r\nwest coast of Ireland, and after favourable but blowing weather, arrived\r\nthe 4 of April, N.S. in the isle of Lewis, where we enquired if no ship\r\nhad touched there lately from Spain, or if there was no particular news\r\nin the country; but finding them ignorant of any thing that could give\r\nus light into what we wanted to be informed of, we remain\u0027d there some\r\ndays, and at last had accounts that two frigats were come to an anchor\r\non the other side of the island, on which I went with all haste there,\r\nnot doubting but it was those we were longing for. I found them already\r\nsailed, but a gentleman of the country informed me that they were the\r\nsame, and were gone some miles farther to Stornoway, the only toun or\r\nrather village on all the island. I went the same night there, and found\r\nthem in the harbour at an anchor, and the men still aboard....\r\n\r\nThe Marquesses of Seafort and Tullibardine came and joined us next day,\r\nand in the evening held a council of war to resolve what was to be done.\r\nThe Earl Marischal first asked to know what commissions each had, that\r\nthe command might be regulated, and Lord Tullibardine not owning his\r\nlate commissions, the command remain\u0027d in him as eldest Major General.\r\nIt was then disputed whether it was fit to go immediately to the main\r\nland of Scotland, or to continue in the island where we were till we\r\nhad advice of the Duke of Ormonde\u0027s landing in England. This last party\r\nwas much insisted on by Lord Tullibardine and Glenderuel, but all the\r\nrest being against it, because we might easily be block\u0027d up in the isle\r\nby two or three of the enemies ships, it was resolved to follow the\r\nproject which the Earl Marischal had proposed to the Cardinal, to land\r\nas soon as possible in Scotland, and with the Spaniards and Highlanders\r\nwho should first join us, march straight to Inverness, in which there\r\nwere not above 300 of the enemies foot, who would be in no condition to\r\noppose us, and to remain there till we should be joined by such a body\r\nof horse and foot as should put us in a condition of marching to the\r\nmore southern parts of the Kingdom. The council of war being at an end,\r\nthe Spanish troops were order\u0027d to debark that they might refraich\r\nthemselves after a voyage of 42 days, and it was resolved to sail for\r\nthe main land three days after....\r\n\r\nWe had no sooner debarked the troops and ammunition,[75] than the Earl\r\nMarischal and Brigadier Campbel proposed marching straight to Inverness\r\nwith the Spaniards and 500 Highlanders, whom the Marquess of Seafort\r\npromised to give us, to surprise the enemies garison, who as yet had no\r\naccounts of us; but the same demon who had inspired them with the design\r\nof staying in the Lewis, hinder\u0027d them from accepting this proposition.\r\nWe were all in the dark what could be the meaning of these dilatory\r\nproceedings, which was discover\u0027d to be the effects of the measures they\r\nhad already taken, for before the Earl Marischal\u0027s arrival, they (not\r\nknowing but that he might have a commission superior to the Marquess of\r\nTullibardine\u0027s) had wrote letters in a circular manner to most of their\r\nfriends, acquainting them that it was the King\u0027s intentions that no body\r\nshould take arms till the Spanish troops were landed in England; and\r\ntherefore the Marquess declared that till then he would not stir from\r\nwhere he was, nor even allow any detachments to be made; and some days\r\nafter, finding that we had still no accounts of the Duke of Ormonde,\r\nnor of any movement in England, he proposed that without further delay\r\nwe should embark aboard the same vessels and return to Spain, from which\r\nwith great difficulty he was dissuaded.\r\n\r\nBut the Earl Marischal, fearing that he might renew the same design in\r\ncase the news we expected was long a coming, declared to him the day\r\nafter that he was resolved to send the two fregats immediately back to\r\nSpain, they being no longer in safety where they were, for being already\r\ndiscover\u0027d, it was natural to believe that the Government of England\r\nwould immediately send ships to block them up, or to intercept them in\r\ntheir passage home, and in spight of all the arts they used to detain\r\nthem, three days after they sailed; and indeed just in time, for not a\r\nweek after their departure arrived three English men of war, much\r\nsuperior to ours both in force and equipage, who, finding we had put\r\nmost of our ammunition and provisions into an old castel, situate on the\r\nshore, under the guard of a detachment of 45 Spaniards, immediately\r\nbegan to batter it from the three ships, and the same night obliged them\r\nto surrender prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nOur ships were no sooner sailed than the Marquess of Tullibardine began\r\nto think of other measures. His retrait out of the island was now\r\nimpracticable in the manner he had designed it, and now he resolved to\r\ndraw what ships he could together, but it was too late; he had given the\r\nenemy time to draw troops not only from the remote parts of the Kingdom,\r\nbut even from Holland. The regiments of Kapell, May, and Sturler, were\r\nalready arrived, and his circular letters had given those who were not\r\nvery willing an excellent excuse, he himself having already wrote to\r\nthem that they should not take arms.\r\n\r\nOur affairs were in this condition, when we received the news, of the\r\nentire dispersion of the Duke of Ormond\u0027s fleet; but at the same time\r\nour friends assured us that all diligence was using in Spain to put it\r\nin a condition to sail again that same spring. This left us still some\r\nhopes, and therefore we order\u0027d the gentlemen who were nearest us to\r\nassemble their vassalls, but this last accident had disheartned them,\r\nthat not above a thousand men appeared, and even those seemed not very\r\nfond of the enterprize.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was by this time within three days march of us, with four\r\nregiments of foot, and a detachment of a fifth, and 150 dragoons, and\r\nwaited only for the provisions which was necessary to be carried along\r\n(into a country full of mountains and possessed by the enemy,) to march\r\nto attack us in our post which, by the situation, was strong enough had\r\nit been well defended; our right was cover\u0027d by a rivulet which was\r\ndifficult to pass, and our left by a ravine, and in the front the ground\r\nwas so rugged and steep that it was almost impossible to come at us.\r\nHowever, the tenth of June the enemy appear\u0027d at the foot of the\r\nmountain, and after having reconnoitred the ground he attacked a\r\ndetachment we had posted on our right on the other side of the rivulet\r\ncommanded by Lord George Murray, who not being succour\u0027d as he ought,\r\nwas obliged to retire, but without any loss. At the same time our center\r\nwas attacked and forced with very little loss on either side; and after\r\na skirmish of about three hours, in which not above a hundred men were\r\nkilled or wounded on both sides, and of distinction only the Marquess of\r\nSeafort wounded, our troops were forced to retire to the top of the\r\nmountain, whose height hinder\u0027d the enemies pursuit.[76] By this time it\r\nwas night, which gave the chiefs of our party time to consult what was\r\nto be done in this urgency, and on considering that they had neither\r\nprovisions nor ammunition, that the few troops they had had behaved in a\r\nmanner not to give great encouragement to try a second action, it was\r\nresolved, that the Spaniards should surrender, and the Highlanders\r\ndisperse. Don Nicolas Bolano, who commanded the detachment of the\r\nregiment of Galicia, offer\u0027d to attack the enemy once more; but the\r\ngeneral officers judging the attempt in vain, the first resolution was\r\nfollowed, and accordingly next morning the Spaniards surrender\u0027d on\r\ncondition their baggage should not be plunder\u0027d, and every body else\r\ntook the road he liked best. As I was then sick of a feavour, I was\r\nforced to lurck some months in the mountains, and in the beginning of\r\nSeptember having got a ship, I embarcked at Peterhead, and 4 days after\r\nlanded in Hollande at the Texel.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] 1718.\r\n\r\n[74] 1719.\r\n\r\n[75] On the mainland.\r\n\r\n[76] This was the Battle of Glenshiel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND SCOTLAND CONTRASTED (1725[77]).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_A Journey through Scotland, in familiar Letters from a\r\n    Gentleman here, to his Friend Abroad_, p. 269, by J. Macky. Second\r\n    edition. (London: 1729.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no nation where a man hath fairer play for his liberty, than in\r\nScotland: Here are no Sheriffs Officers, and Marshal\u0027s men, that will\r\nwhip you off the street at London, and run you into a spunging-house at\r\nonce; but here if you owe money, you are summoned to show cause why you\r\ndon\u0027t pay it; which if you don\u0027t do, you have six days allowed you\r\nbefore a caption comes out against your person; which is executed by\r\nthese messengers only, who are all put in by the Lord Lion,[78] and wear\r\na greyhound on a green ribbon, as a badge, when they are in the\r\nexecution of their office.\r\n\r\nThe ladies dress as in England, with this difference, that when they go\r\nabroad, from the highest to the lowest, they wear a plaid, which covers\r\nhalf of the face, and all their body. In Spain, Flanders, and Holland,\r\nyou know the women go all to church and market, with a black mantle over\r\ntheir heads and body: But these in Scotland are all striped with green,\r\nscarlet, and other colours, and most of them lined with silk; which in\r\nthe middle of a church, on a Sunday, looks like a _parterre de fleurs_.\r\n\r\nI have been at several consorts of musick, and must say, that I never\r\nsaw in any nation an assembly of greater beauties, than those I have\r\nseen at Edinburgh. The ladies are particular in a stately firm way of\r\nwalking, with their joints extended, and their toes out: But I cannot\r\nsay, that the common people are near so clean or handsome as the\r\nEnglish. The young ladies are all bred good housewives; and the\r\nservant-maids are always kept at some work here: The spinning-wheels,\r\nboth for woollen and linnen, are always going in most houses; and a\r\ngentleman of a good estate is not ashamed to wear a suit of cloaths of\r\nhis lady\u0027s and servants\u0027 spinning. They make a great deal of linnen all\r\nover the Kingdom, not only for their own use, but export it to England,\r\nand to the Plantations. In short, the women are all kept employed, from\r\nthe highest to the lowest of them.\r\n\r\nBut the men here are not so usefully employed as in England: There the\r\nproduction of every county is improved by joint-stocks amongst the\r\ninhabitants of the several counties. Iron-works, lead-works,\r\nmanufactories, and every thing else that may conduce to the common\r\nwelfare of the nation, are set on foot, and carried on. But here, altho\r\ntheir rivers plentifully abound with salmon for exportation, their\r\ncoasts with white fish and herrings, more than any other in Europe; yet\r\nthe gentry, or landed men, never concern themselves about it, as a thing\r\nbelow them; and leave those improvements to burghers of towns, who, for\r\nwant of a sufficient stock, are not able to carry it on.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the nobility have of late run into parking, planting, and\r\ngardening, which are great improvements of their estates; but what is\r\nthis to the bulk of a nation, which (if encouraged) hath as many natural\r\ncommodities for exportation as any whatsoever, and more than\r\nSouth-Britain? But a finer education than what is necessary for trade,\r\nhath been, in imitation of the French, the misfortune of this kingdom;\r\nbut perhaps the union with England may open their eyes to their own\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Low-Countries of Scotland is the same with that\r\nwhich is spoken all over England; only an Englishman will understand a\r\nScotchman better by his writing than speaking; for the difference in the\r\npronunciation of the vowels, which are the same in writing, makes a\r\ngreat alteration in speaking.\r\n\r\nThe Scots pronounce the five vowels, a, e, i, o, u, just as the French,\r\nGermans, and Italians do; and the English, according to that\r\npronunciation, make them [oe], i, y, o, u. This difference of sound in\r\nthe vowels, makes a great one in the pronunciation.\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders have a language of their own, which the Irish own to be\r\nthe purest of that Irish which they spake in the province of Ulster in\r\nIreland; which is also spoken in the greatest purity in the Western\r\nIslands that lie between Scotland and Ireland: They being an unmixed\r\npeople, have preserved that language and the dress better than the Irish\r\nhave done, who have been over-run with Danes, English, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[77] About.\r\n\r\n[78] The Lyon King-at-Arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MALT TAX (1725).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The Lockhart Papers: containing Memoirs and Commentaries\r\n    upon the Affairs of Scotland from 1702 to 1715, by George Lockhart,\r\n    Esq., of Carnwath. His Secret Correspondence with the Son of King\r\n    James the Second from 1718 to 1728, and his other Political\r\n    Writings_, vol. ii., p. 134. (London: 1817.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the latter end of the year 1724 a resolution passed the House of\r\nCommons whereby, instead of the malt tax, six pence per barrel of ale\r\nwas laid of additional duty on Scotland (and not extended to England)\r\nand the premiums on grain exported from thence was taken off. As this\r\nwas a plain breach of the Union, in so far as it expressly stipulated\r\nthat there shall be an equality of taxes and premiums on trade, every\r\nScots man was highly enraged at it, for as it was evident that the want\r\nof the premiums would effectively stop the exportation of grain, which\r\nwould thereby become a mere drug, no body could foresee to what height\r\nthis precedent of taxing Scotland separately from England might\r\nafterwards be extended. Tis impossible to express the resentment of the\r\nnation at this measure, all parties seemed reconciled and to unite in\r\nopposing what was so pernicious to the country in general, and at the\r\nsame time touched every particular man\u0027s copyhold. The King\u0027s friends\r\nlaid hold upon this occasion, and privately, underhand, fomented the bad\r\nhumour, it not being fit, as indeed there was no need of their\r\ndistinguishing their zeal at this time. A meeting of the heritors of the\r\nshire of Edinburgh was called, where I presented an address to the House\r\nof Commons, which being heartily approved of, was signed and next day\r\nsent up by an express to London....\r\n\r\nThese warm addresses and instructions did not a little startle the Scots\r\nmembers of Parliament, and even the Ministry; and there were likewise\r\nmany private letters written to them by their friends, assuring them of\r\nthe highest resentment if they did not perform what was desired and\r\nexpected of them. Had these members been endued with a public spirit and\r\nresolution, such applications would have been needless; but as they\r\nconsisted of a parcel of people of low fortunes that could not subsist\r\nwithout their board-wages (which at ten guineas a week during each\r\nsession was duly paid them) or mere tools and dependents, it was not to\r\nbe expected they would act the part which became them for their\r\ncountry\u0027s service, and therefore these representations were judged\r\nnecessary to spur them up to their duty and withal show the Ministry\r\nthat the people would not behave so tamely as did their mean spirited\r\nmercenary representatives, who, perceiving they would lose all their\r\ninterest and scarce dare venture to return home if they did not follow\r\nthe instructions given them, made most humble applications to the\r\nMinistry, who on the other hand being apprehensive the resentment might\r\nbe carried to some height, and unwilling, as matters stood in Europe, to\r\nembroil themselves, thought it expedient to drop the resolutions above\r\nmentioned, (which they at first preferred, because they judged it would\r\nbe no easy matter to levy the malt tax in Scotland) and agreed with the\r\nScots members to impose threepence per bushel on malt; being but the\r\nhalf of what was laid in England; and a bill was accordingly passed as\r\nfast as the forms could possibly allow of, least their constituents\r\nshould have time to remonstrate against it....\r\n\r\nSome little time before the 23rd of June (on which day the malt tax\r\ncommenced) delegates were sent from most of the considerable touns, to\r\nmeet and confer with the brewers at Edinburgh, where many proposals\r\nwere made for eluding the law, to be, as occasions offered, put in\r\npractice: the first thing to be guarded against was the dutys of malt\r\nstock in hand; and to avoid the heavy penalty of not entering the same,\r\nit was resolved to obey the law in that respect, but at the same time\r\nnot to make payment of the duty thereon, and if the Commissioners of\r\nexcise sued them, to give over brewing and consequently sink the revenue\r\nof excise, which was indeed chiefly aimed at by those who bestirred\r\nthemselves at this time in behalf of the country, that the Government\r\nmight perceive they\u0027d lose more of the excise than they could gain by\r\nthe malt tax: but what alarmed people most was the unreasonable article\r\nof surcharge, to be levied proportionately off such as entered and paid\r\nthe duty of what was malted after 23rd of June, in so far as the clear\r\nproduce (after deducing the charges of collecting) fell short of\r\n20,000_l._ sterling, whereby those who submitted to the Government and\r\npaid the malt tax ran the hazard of making up the deficiencie arising\r\nfrom those who did otherwise, which so startled all the considerable\r\nbrewers, who generally speaking are also maltsters, that they found it\r\nabsolutely necessary to malt none after the commencement of this duty.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of June, when the duty took place, the excise officers were\r\nobliged to fly out of most of the towns in the western shires, but in\r\nGlasgow the resentment ran higher. Daniell Campbell of Shawfeild, who\r\nrepresented that burgh in Parliament, having incurred the hatred of the\r\ninhabitants thereof, because he was believed, on too good grounds, to\r\nhave had the chief hand in giving the Government such informations of\r\nthe way and manner of trading there, as occasioned a few years ago an\r\nact of Parliament, that lay heavily on their tobacco trade, was likewise\r\nsaid and believed to have encouraged to hope there was no difficulty in\r\nraising the malt tax; and these joined together rendered him detestable\r\nover all the Kingdom, especially at Glasgow, where they threatened to\r\npull down his new built house, whereof he sent notice to Wade at\r\nEdinburgh on 21st of June, who thereupon ordered a detachment of foot\r\nto march forthwith thither, where they arrived on the 24th at night, but\r\nthe guard room being unprepared, they put off taking possession of it\r\ntill next day, the soldiers being dismist to their several private\r\nquarters. During the night time a report went about that Daniell\r\nCampbell had brought these soldiers to enslave them, whereupon the mob\r\ngot up and destroyed his house, and had he himself been in town, they\r\nhad certainly dewitted him. Whilst this was in hand the commanding\r\nofficer got his men together, took possession of the guard room and drew\r\nup before it, and tho he met with no insult but from some boys and\r\nwomen, who threw a few stones at his men, without having previously read\r\nthe proclamation, as directed by the law on such occasions, he fired\r\nallongst the streets, which being full of innocent people that came out\r\nof curiosity to know what the matter was, and the windows at the same\r\ntime crowded with spectators, about 20 men and women were killd dead and\r\nmany more wounded, some whereof in the streets and others in their\r\nhouses: the citizens being thereby enraged did ring the fire bell and\r\nbrake up the magazine, from whence they armed about 400 men. In the mean\r\ntime the magistrates advised the officer to march off his party, for\r\nthey could not be protected within the city; on which he made the best\r\nof his way to Dumbarton, but not thinking himself safe in that town he\r\nretired into the castle. The Glasgow mob pursued him a few miles but\r\ncould not overtake him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL WADE\u0027S ROADS (1726).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Letters from a Gentleman in the North of Scotland to his\r\n    Friend in London_, vol. ii., p. 183, by Captain Burt. Fifth edition.\r\n    (London: 1822.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XXVI. CONCERNING THE NEW ROADS, ETC., 173-.\r\n\r\nThese new roads were begun in the year 1726, and have continued about\r\neleven years in the prosecution; yet, long as it may be thought, if you\r\nwere to pass over the whole work (for the borders of it would show you\r\nwhat it was), I make no doubt but that number of years would diminish in\r\nyour imagination to a much shorter tract of time, by comparison with the\r\ndifficulties that attended the execution.\r\n\r\nBut, before I proceed to any particular descriptions of them, I shall\r\ninform you how they lie, to the end that you may trace them out upon a\r\nmap of Scotland; and first I shall take them as they are made, to enter\r\nthe mountains, viz.--\r\n\r\nOne of them begins from Crief, which is about fourteen miles from\r\nStirling: here the Romans left off their works, of which some parts are\r\nvisible to this day, particularly the camp at Ardoch, where the vestiges\r\nof the fortifications are on a moor so barren, that its whole form has\r\nbeen safe from culture, or other alteration besides weather and time.\r\n\r\nThe other road enters the hills at Dimheld,[79] in Athol, which is about\r\nten miles from Perth.\r\n\r\nThe first of them, according to my account, though the last in\r\nexecution, proceeds through Glenalmond (which, for its narrowness, and\r\nthe height of the mountains, I remember to have mentioned formerly), and\r\nthence it goes to Aberfaldy; there it crosses the river Tay by a bridge\r\nof free-stone, consisting of five spacious arches (by the way, this\r\nmilitary bridge is the only passage over that wild and dangerous river),\r\nand from thence the road goes on to Dalnachardoch.\r\n\r\nThe other road from Dunkeld proceeds by the Blair of Athol to the said\r\nDalnachardoch.\r\n\r\nHere the two roads join in one, and, as a single road, it leads on to\r\nDalwhinny, where it branches out again into two; of which one proceeds\r\ntowards the north-west, through Garva Moor, and over the Coriarach\r\nmountain to Fort Augustus, at Killichumen, and the other branch goes\r\ndue-north to the barrack of Ruthven, in Badenoch, and thence, by\r\nDelmagary, to Inverness. From thence it proceeds something to the\r\nsouthward of the west, across the island, to the aforesaid Fort-Augustus\r\nand so on to Fort-William, in Lochaber.\r\n\r\nThe length of all these roads put together is about two hundred and\r\nfifty miles....\r\n\r\nIn the summer seasons, five hundred of the soldiers from the barracks,\r\nand other quarters about the Highlands, were employed in those works in\r\ndifferent stations, by detachments from the regiments and Highland\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe private men were allowed sixpence a day, over and above their pay as\r\nsoldiers: a corporal had eight-pence, and a sergeant a shilling; but\r\nthis extra pay was only for working-days, which were often interrupted\r\nby violent storms of wind and rain, from the heights and hollows of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThese parties of men were under the command and direction of proper\r\nofficers, who were all subalterns, and received two shillings and\r\nsixpence _per diem_, to defray their extraordinary expence in building\r\nhuts; making necessary provision for their tables from distant parts;\r\nunavoidable though unwelcome visits, and other incidents arising from\r\ntheir wild situation....\r\n\r\nThe standard breadth of these roads, as laid down at the first\r\nprojection, is sixteen feet; but in some parts, where there were no very\r\nexpensive difficulties, they are wider....\r\n\r\nThe old ways (for roads I shall not call them) consisted chiefly of\r\nstony moors, bogs, rugged, rapid fords, declivities of hills, entangling\r\nwoods, and giddy precipices. You will say this is a dreadful catalogue\r\nto be read to him that is about to take a Highland journey. I have not\r\nmentioned the valleys, for they are few in number, far divided asunder,\r\nand generally the roads through them were easily made.\r\n\r\nMy purpose now is to give you some account of the nature of the\r\nparticular parts above-mentioned, and the manner how this extraordinary\r\nwork has been executed; and this I shall do in the order I have ranged\r\nthem as above.\r\n\r\nAnd first, the stony moors. These are mostly tracts of ground of several\r\nmiles in length, and often very high, with frequent lesser risings and\r\ndescents, and having for surface a mixture of stones and heath. The\r\nstones are fixed in the earth, being very large and unequal, and\r\ngenerally are as deep in the ground as they appear above it; and where\r\nthere are any spaces between the stones, there is a loose spongy sward,\r\nperhaps not above five or six inches deep, and incapable to produce any\r\nthing but heath, and all beneath it is hard gravel or rock....\r\n\r\nHere the workmen first made room to fix their instruments, and then, by\r\nstrength, and the help of those two mechanic powers, the screw and the\r\nlever, they raised out of their ancient beds those massive bodies, and\r\nthen filling up the cavities with gravel, set them up, mostly end-ways,\r\nalong the sides of the road, as directions in time of deep snows, being\r\nsome of them, as they now stand, eight or nine feet high. They serve,\r\nlikewise, as memorials of the skill and labour requisite to the\r\nperformance of so difficult a work....\r\n\r\nNow that I have no further occasion for any distinction, I shall call\r\nevery soft place a bog, except there be occasion sometimes to vary the\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\nWhen one of these bogs has crossed the way on a stony moor, there the\r\nloose ground has been dug out down to the gravel, or rock, and the\r\nhollow filled up in the manner following, viz.--\r\n\r\nFirst with a layer of large stones, then a smaller size, to fill up the\r\ngaps and raise the causeway higher; and, lastly, two, three, or more\r\nfeet of gravel, to fill up the interstices of the small stones, and form\r\na smooth and binding surface. This part of the road has a bank on each\r\nside, to separate it from a ditch, which is made without-side to receive\r\nthe water from the bog, and, if the ground will allow it, to convey it\r\nby a trench to a slope, and thereby in some measure drain it....\r\n\r\nThe objections made to these new roads and bridges, by some in the\r\nseveral degrees of _condition_ among the Highlanders, are in part as\r\nfollow: viz.--\r\n\r\nI. These chiefs and other gentlemen complain, that thereby an easy\r\npassage is opened into their country for strangers, who, in time, by\r\ntheir suggestions of liberty, will weaken that attachment of their\r\nvassals which it is so necessary for them to support and preserve. That\r\ntheir fastnesses being laid open, they are deprived of that security\r\nfrom invasion which they formerly enjoyed. That the bridges, in\r\nparticular, will render the ordinary people effeminate, and less fit to\r\npass the waters in other places where there are none. And there is a\r\npecuniary reason concealed, relating to some foreign courts, which to\r\nyou I need not explain.\r\n\r\nII. The middling order say to them the roads are an inconvenience,\r\ninstead of being useful, as they have turned them out of their old ways;\r\nfor their horses being never shod, the gravel would soon whet away their\r\nhoofs, so as to render them unserviceable; whereas the rocks and\r\nmoor-stones, though together they make a rough way, yet, considered\r\nseparately, they are generally pretty smooth on the surface where they\r\ntread, and the heath is always easy to their feet....\r\n\r\nIII. The lowest class, who, many of them, at some times cannot compass a\r\npair of shoes for themselves, they alledge, that the gravel is\r\nintolerable to their naked feet; and the complaint has extended to their\r\nthin brogues. It is true they do sometimes, for these reasons, go\r\nwithout the road, and ride or walk in very incommodious ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] Dunkeld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTTISH GARDENING (1735).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Letters of John Cockburn of Ormistoun to his Gardener,\r\n    1727-1744_, p. 22.

We have this day a\r\ngreat deal of soft rain, which if with you will do great service to\r\nforward both Grass and Corn and may secure many of the weak rooted trees\r\nplanted last Winter and also make your lay\u0027d trees strike root if well\r\nearthed.\r\n\r\nThis I design chiefly for some thoughts about improving of your father\u0027s\r\nGarden and land of which if you go right you\u0027l turn a good deal off into\r\nKitchen and Orchard Garden. In doing of which I still think you might\r\nhave made more progress last Winter and by so doing you might have made\r\na beginning in drawing the people towards a better taste in Garden\r\nstuff, which tho\u0027 you had made no other profit directly, yet that, if\r\nyou had saved yourself only, as to the expence, would have been getting\r\n[profit], as it would have encreased the demand next year.... Your\r\nfather\u0027s Garden is well sheltered by the houses and rising Ground from\r\nthe one hand and by the high hedge of the other, and he has water at\r\nhand. So he may raise any thing in it the climate will allow of. He has\r\ncrowded it with fruit trees, too thick even for them to bear as they\r\nwould, espicially when a little older, as in that warm place they\r\nadvance very fast. By this he loses the undergrowth also, by which he\r\nmight make double what he makes by the fruit from the trees, espicially\r\nthey being of the most common fruit, which would answer as well in the\r\nmost exposed part of his field. So warm a lying spot should either have\r\nbeen employed entirely in doubled crops for a Kitchen, or, if for fruit,\r\nit should have been in kinds every spot won\u0027t produce, and for that\r\nreason yielded more. I incline to think mulberys would have done of\r\neither side the walk at the lower end, as being warm and covered from\r\nall severe weather. If so, one tree of them would have yielded as much\r\nmoney as half a dozen of the common apples now in it, and would have\r\ntaken no more room than one of the present. I am convinced that if\r\nMulberys will do any where in Scotld. they will there, it being entirely\r\ncovered from Weather and yet open to the Sun, except in so far as shaded\r\nby apple trees.... What I aim at is to turn your ground to the best and\r\nmost proper uses, the warmest and best to what requires it, and the\r\ncommon coarse fruits or herbs to places where they will do and the nicer\r\nwon\u0027t....\r\n\r\nDepend upon it there are people in Eden.[81] who have taste, and if you\r\ncan once get into the custom of some who have it, will put others upon\r\nenquiring where they had good things, and this will hold in your herbs\r\netc. as well as in your Fruit. Do you think it possible that there are\r\nnot Families and Taverns in Eden. that would give reasonably for young\r\npease and Beans in July and Aug^t if they could get them. Suppose now\r\nyou sent a dish of young pease or Beans to any of your Customers when\r\nonly old are to be had, and desire them to let their acquaintances know\r\nyou can furnish the like, don\u0027t you think they would go off, or if you\r\ngot into the custom of such as Mrs. Thom, who keeps a Tavern, do you\r\nbelieve she would not find people who would be glad of them, and so\r\nwould take from you. Possibly they may not give such a price as just\r\nwhen first coming in, but if you get a price you can afford them at, it\r\ndoes your business.... People would presently come to distinguish as\r\nthey came in to buy when Garden stuff was first introduced. But our\r\npeople are lazie, and saying no body will buy and no body will\r\ndistinguish, is chiefly owing to the want of activity, Industry and care\r\nin providing at all or good of their kinds, and bustling a little to\r\nintroduce and get Customers at first. We are glad of all excuses for our\r\nsleeping on in poverty and our old jog trott. How shall things be\r\ncarried to Eden. and no body will buy in the country are often very good\r\ndifficulties and convenient enough excuses, wherein excuse is wanted. I\r\ndon\u0027t know if you have a Carrier at Orm:[82] but I am convinced one who\r\nunderstood his business, would get Employment for a Cart such as the\r\nHiglers[83] to the Gardiners who come to Covent Garden use. They would\r\ncarry things cool and clean, and one man with two horses in such a Cart,\r\nwould carry in as much as four Carriers with 4 horses carry in our\r\ncommon way and if you put your things up in Baskets carefully as\r\nGardiners do here, by which they\u0027l not be wet, Bruised or Broiled in the\r\nSun, the Cart being covered as the Garden Stuff commonly is, in carrying\r\nto Eden. Even care in this will make them fresher and better than what\r\nis now to be had there.\r\n\r\nHAMPSTEAD, _3^d June_, 1735.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[80] His gardener\u0027s name was Charles Bell.\r\n\r\n[81] Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[82] Ormiston.\r\n\r\n[83] Costermongers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTEOUS RIOTS (1736).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Autobiography of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Carlyle,\r\n    Minister of Inveresk, 1722-1770_, p. 33. (Edinburgh and London:\r\n    1860.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI was witness to a very extraordinary scene that happened in the month\r\nof February or March 1736, which was the escape of Robertson, a\r\ncondemned criminal, from the Tolbooth Church in Edinburgh. In these days\r\nit was usual to bring the criminals who were condemned to death into\r\nthat church, to attend public worship every Sunday after their\r\ncondemnation, when the clergyman made some part of his discourse and\r\nprayers to suit their situation; which, among other circumstances of\r\nsolemnity which then attended the state of condemned criminals, had no\r\nsmall effect on the public mind. Robertson and Wilson were smugglers,\r\nand had been condemned for robbing a custom-house, where some of their\r\ngoods had been deposited; a crime what at that time did not seem, in the\r\nopinion of the common people, to deserve so severe a punishment. I was\r\ncarried by an acquaintance to church to see the prisoners on the Sunday\r\nbefore the day of execution. We went early into the church on purpose to\r\nsee them come in, and were seated in a pew before the gallery in front\r\nof the pulpit. Soon after we went into the church by the door from the\r\nParliament Close, the criminals were brought in by the door next the\r\nTolbooth, and placed in a long pew, not far from the pulpit. Four\r\nsoldiers came in with them, and placed Robertson at the head of the pew,\r\nand Wilson below him, two of themselves sitting below Wilson, and two in\r\na pew behind him.\r\n\r\nThe bells were ringing and the doors were open, while the people were\r\ncoming into the church. Robertson watched his opportunity, and, suddenly\r\nspringing up, got over the pew into the passage that led in to the door\r\nin the Parliament Close, and, no person offering to lay hands on him,\r\nmade his escape in a moment--so much the more easily, perhaps, as\r\neverybody\u0027s attention was drawn to Wilson, who was a stronger man, and\r\nwho, attempting to follow Robertson, was seized by the soldiers, and\r\nstruggled so long with them that the two who at last followed Robertson\r\nwere too late. It was reported that he had maintained his struggle that\r\nhe might let his companion have time. That might be his second thought,\r\nbut his first certainly was to escape himself, for I saw him set his\r\nfoot on the seat to leap over, when the soldiers pulled him back. Wilson\r\nwas immediately carried out to the Tolbooth, and Robertson, getting\r\nuninterrupted through the Parliament Square, down the back stairs, into\r\nthe Cowgate, was heard of no more till he arrived in Holland. This was\r\nan interesting scene, and by filling the public mind with compassion for\r\nthe unhappy person who did not escape, and who was the better character\r\nof the two, had probably some influence in producing what followed; for\r\nwhen the sentence against Wilson came to be executed a few weeks\r\nthereafter, a very strong opinion prevailed that there was a plot to\r\nforce the Town Guard, whose duty it is to attend executions under the\r\norder of a civil magistrate.\r\n\r\nThere was a Captain Porteous, who by his good behaviour in the army had\r\nobtained a subaltern\u0027s commission, and had afterwards, when on half-pay,\r\nbeen preferred to the command of the City Guard. This man, by his skill\r\nin manly exercises, particularly the golf, and by gentlemanly behaviour,\r\nwas admitted into the company of his superiors, which elated his mind,\r\nand added insolence to his native roughness, so that he was much feared\r\nand hated by the mob of Edinburgh. When the day of execution came, the\r\nrumour of a deforcement at the gallows prevailed strongly; and the\r\nProvost and Magistrates (not in their own minds very strong) thought it\r\na good measure to apply for three or four companies of a marching\r\nregiment that lay in the Canongate, to be drawn up in the Lawnmarket, a\r\nstreet leading from the Tolbooth to the Grassmarket, the place of\r\nexecution, in order to overawe the mob by their being at hand. Porteous,\r\nwho it is said, had his natural courage increased to rage by any\r\nsuspicion that he and his Guard could not execute the law, and being\r\nheated likewise with wine--for he had dined, as the custom then was,\r\nbetween one and two--became perfectly furious when he passed by the\r\nthree companies drawn up in the street as he marched along with his\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n... The street is long and wide, and there was a very great crowd\r\nassembled. The execution went on with the usual forms, and Wilson\r\nbehaved in a manner very becoming his situation. There was not the least\r\nappearance of an attempt to rescue; but soon after the executioner had\r\ndone his duty, there was an attack made upon him, as usual on such\r\noccasions, by the boys and blackguards throwing stones and dirt in\r\ntestimony of their abhorrence of the hangman. But there was no attempt\r\nto break through the guard and cut down the prisoner. It was generally\r\nsaid that there was very little, if any, more violence than had usually\r\nhappened on such occasions. Porteous, however, inflamed with wine and\r\njealousy, thought proper to order his Guard to fire, their muskets being\r\nloaded with slugs; and when the soldiers showed reluctance, I saw him\r\nturn to them with threatening gesture and an inflamed countenance. They\r\nobeyed, and fired; but wishing to do as little harm as possible, many of\r\nthem elevated their pieces, the effect of which was that some people\r\nwere wounded in the windows; and one unfortunate lad, whom we had\r\ndisplaced, was killed in the stair window by a slug entering his head.\r\nHis name was Henry Black, a journey man tailor, whose bride was the\r\ndaughter of the house we were in. She fainted away when he was brought\r\ninto the house speechless, where he only lived till nine or ten o\u0027clock.\r\nWe had seen many people, women and men, fall in the street, and at first\r\nthought it was only through fear, and by their crowding on one another\r\nto escape. But when the crowd dispersed, we saw them lying dead or\r\nwounded, and had no longer any doubt of what had happened. The numbers\r\nwere said to be eight or nine killed, and double the number wounded; but\r\nthis was never exactly known.\r\n\r\nThis unprovoked slaughter irritated the common people to the last; and\r\nthe state of grief and rage into which their minds were thrown, was\r\nvisible in the high commotion that appeared in the multitude.... The\r\nsequel of this affair was, that Porteous was tried and condemned to be\r\nhanged; but by the intercession of some of the Judges themselves, who\r\nthought his case hard, he was reprieved by the Queen-Regent. The\r\nMagistrates, who on this occasion, as on the former, acted weakly,\r\ndesigned to have him removed to the Castle for greater security. But a\r\nplot was laid and conducted by some persons unknown with the greatest\r\nsecrecy, policy, and vigour, to prevent that design, by forcing the\r\nprison the night before, and executing the sentence upon him themselves,\r\nwhich to effectuate cost them from eight at night till two in the\r\nmorning; and yet this plot was managed so dexterously that they met with\r\nno interruption, though there were five companies of a marching regiment\r\nlying in the Canongate.\r\n\r\nThis happened on the 7th of September, 1736; and so prepossessed were\r\nthe minds of every person that something extraordinary would take place\r\nthat day, that I, at Prestonpans, nine miles from Edinburgh, dreamt that\r\nI saw Captain Porteous hanged in the Grassmarket. I got up betwixt six\r\nand seven, and went to my father\u0027s servant, who was thrashing in the\r\nbarn which lay on the roadside leading to Aberlady and North Berwick,\r\nwho said that several men on horseback had passed about five in the\r\nmorning, whom having asked for news, they replied there was none, but\r\nthat Captain Porteous had been dragged out of prison, and hanged on a\r\ndyer\u0027s tree at two o\u0027clock that morning.\r\n\r\nThis bold and lawless deed not only provoked the Queen, who was Regent\r\nat the time, but gave some uneasiness to Government. It was represented\r\nas a dangerous plot, and was ignorantly connected with a great meeting\r\nof zealous Covenanters, of whom many still remained in Galloway and the\r\nwest, which had been held in summer, in Pentland Hills, to renew the\r\nCovenant. But this was a mistake; for the murder of Porteous had been\r\nplanned and executed by a few of the relations or friends of those whom\r\nhe had slain; who, being of a rank superior to mere mob, had carried on\r\ntheir design with so much secrecy, ability, and steadiness as made it be\r\nascribed to a still higher order, who were political enemies to\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"CAMBUSLANG WARK\" (1742).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The Statistical Account of Scotland, drawn up from the\r\n    communications of the ministers of the different parishes_, vol. v.,\r\n    p. 266, by Sir John Sinclair, Bart. (Edinburgh: 1793.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Statistical Account of Cambuslang._\r\n\r\nIn the statistical account of this parish, it will doubtless be\r\nexpected, that some mention should be made of those remarkable religious\r\nphenomena, which took place under Mr. M\u0027Culloch\u0027s ministry, commonly\r\ncalled \"Cambuslang conversions.\" In treating of this subject, it will be\r\nproper to give a brief historical view, first of the facts, and then of\r\nthe opinions entertained concerning them.\r\n\r\nThe kirk of Cambuslang being small and in bad repair, the minister, when\r\nthe weather was favourable, used to preach in a tent, erected close by a\r\nrivulet, at the foot of a bank or brae near the kirk; which is still\r\ncalled \"the preaching or conversion brae.\"... Towards the end of\r\nJanuary, 1742, two persons, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman,\r\na weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to\r\nsubscribe a petition, which was presented to the minister, desiring that\r\nhe would give them a weekly lecture.... On Monday, 15th February, and\r\nthe two following days, all the fellowship meetings in the parish\r\nconvened in one body in the minister\u0027s house, and were employed for many\r\nhours in fervent prayer for the success of the gospel, and for an\r\noutpouring of the Holy Spirit in their bounds, as in other places\r\nabroad: The next day, being Thursday 18th February, nothing remarkable\r\nhappened during the lecture, except that the hearers were apparently all\r\nattention; but when the minister in his last prayer expressed himself\r\nthus: \"Lord who hath believed our report; and to whom is the arm of the\r\nLord revealed? where are the fruits of my poor labours among this\r\npeople?\" several persons in the congregation cried out publicly, and\r\nabout 50 men and women came to the minister\u0027s house, expressing strong\r\nconviction of sin, and alarming fears of punishment. After this period,\r\nso many people from the neighbourhood resorted to Cambuslang, that the\r\nminister thought himself obliged to provide them with daily sermons or\r\nexhortations, and actually did so for 7 or 8 months.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the converts were affected, for it seems they were all\r\naffected much in the same way, though in very different degrees, is thus\r\ndescribed. They were seized all at once, commonly by something said in\r\nthe sermons or prayers, with the most dreadful apprehensions concerning\r\nthe state of their souls, insomuch that many of them could not abstain\r\nfrom crying out in the most public and dreadful manner, ... The agony\r\nunder which they laboured, was expressed not only by words, but also by\r\nviolent agitations of body; by clapping their hands and beating their\r\nbreasts; by shaking and trembling; by faintings and convulsions; and\r\nsometimes by excessive bleeding at the nose. While they were in this\r\ndistress, the minister often called out to them, not to stifle or\r\nsmother their convictions, but to encourage them; and, after sermon was\r\nended, he retired with them to the manse, and frequently spent the best\r\npart of the night with them in exhortations and prayers. Next day before\r\nsermon began, they were brought out, commonly by More and Bowman, and\r\nhaving napkins tied round their heads, were placed all together on seats\r\nbefore the tent, where they remained sobbing, weeping, and often crying\r\naloud, till the service was over. Some of those who fell under\r\nconviction were never converted; but most of those who fell under it\r\nwere converted in a few days, and sometimes in a few hours.... From the\r\ntime of their conviction to their conversion, many had no appetite for\r\nfood, or inclination to sleep, and all complained of the severity of\r\ntheir sufferings during that interval.\r\n\r\nThis singular work soon became public, made a great noise, and brought\r\nvast numbers of people from all quarters.... Among those who resorted to\r\nCambuslang on this occasion, there were many of the most popular\r\nministers in Scotland; ... M^r Whitefield,[84] who had been in England\r\nfor several months, did not arrive till June. The sacrament was given\r\ntwice in the space of 5 weeks, viz. on 11th July and 15th August.\r\nImmense multitudes of hearers and spectators were present at both, but\r\nespecially at the last. On the Sunday, besides the tent at the foot of\r\nthe brae above described, where the sacrament was dispensed, other two\r\ntents were erected. At each of these there was a very great\r\ncongregation. M^r Whitefield, who was accustomed to numerous audiences,\r\nsupposed, that at the three tents, there were upwards of 30,000 people;\r\na greater number probably than was ever seen on any other sacramental\r\noccasion. Most of the above mentioned ministers and others were\r\nassistants at this solemnity. Four preached on the fast-day, 4 on\r\nSaturday, probably 14 or 15 on Sunday, and 5 on Monday. There were 25\r\ntables, about 120 at each, in all 3,000 communicants. A great many of\r\nthese came from Glasgow and the neighbourhood, about 200 from Edinburgh,\r\nabout 200 from Kilmarnock, about 200 from Irvine and Stewarton, and some\r\nfrom England and Ireland.... The Cambuslang work continued for about six\r\nmonths, that is, from the 18th February till the second communion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] George Whitefield, the friend of Wesley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"FORTY-FIVE.\"\r\n\r\nA.

These informations,\r\nparticularly as to the visit just mentioned, I must confess, have not\r\nhitherto gain\u0027d my belief. This young gentleman\u0027s game seems at present\r\nto be very desperate in this country; and, so far as I can learn, there\r\nis not the least apparatus for his reception, even amongst the few\r\nhighlanders who are suspected to be in his interest. However, as, when\r\nso much is at stake, no advice, how improbable soever, is to be\r\nneglected, I have (our session being now over) resolved to make my\r\naccustomed journey northwards a little earlier than usual; to the end\r\nthat, though my fighting days are over, I may give some countenance to\r\nthe friends of the government, and prevent the seduction of the unwary,\r\nif there should be any truth in what is reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Normand MacLeod to the Lord President._\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LORD,\r\n\r\nTo my no small surprise, it is certain that the Pretended Prince of\r\nWales is come on the coast of South Uist and Barra, and has since been\r\nhovering on parts of the coast of the main land that lies between the\r\npoint of Airdnamurchan and Glenelg; he has but one ship, of which he is\r\naboard; she mounts about 16 or 18 guns. He has about thirty Irish or\r\nFrench officers with him, and one Sheridan, who is called his Governor.\r\nThe Duke of Athol\u0027s brother is the only man of any sort of note (that\r\nonce belonged to this country) that I can hear of that\u0027s alongst with\r\nhim. His view, I need not tell you, was, to raise all the Highlands to\r\nassist him, etc. Sir Alex. Macdonald and I, not only gave no sort of\r\ncountenance to these people, but we used all the interest we had with\r\nour neighbours to follow the same prudent method; and I am persuaded we\r\nhave done it with that success, that not one man of any consequence\r\nbenorth the Grampians will give any sort of assistance to this mad\r\nrebellious attempt. How far you think we acted properly, I shall long to\r\nknow; but this is certain, we did it as our duty and for the best; for\r\nin the present situation of affairs in Europe, I should have been sorry\r\nto see any thing like disaffection to the Government appear, tho\u0027 ever\r\nso trivial; or that there was occasion to march a single company to\r\nquell it, which now I hope and dare say there is not....\r\n\r\n                        I ever am, most faithfully, Yours,\r\n                                        NORMAND MACLEOD.\r\n DUNVEGAN, _3^rd Aug^t_, 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.

The next day Locheil\r\njoined him with seven hundred and fifty men besides double officers, and\r\nM^cdonald of Keppoch arrived in the afternoon with his regiment\r\nconsisting of about three hundred. In less than an hour after the whole\r\nwere drawn up, and the Royal Standart display\u0027d by the D. of A[thole]\r\nwhen the Chevalier made them a short but very pathetick speech.\r\nImporting that it would be no purpose to declaim upon the justice of his\r\nfather\u0027s title to the throne to people who, had they not been convinced\r\nof it, would not have appeared in his behalf, but that he esteemed it as\r\nmuch his duty to endeavour to procure their welfare and happiness as\r\nthey did to assert his right, that it was chiefly with that view that he\r\nhad landed in a part of the Island where he knew he should find a number\r\nof brave gentlemen fired with the \"noble example of their predecessors,\r\nand jealous of their own and their country\u0027s honour, to join with him in\r\nso glorious an enterprise, with whose assistance and the protection of a\r\njust God who never fails to avenge the cause of the injured, he did not\r\ndoubt of bringing the affair to a happy issue....\"\r\n\r\nEverything now being prepared for the Chevalier\u0027s departure, upon the\r\n21st he moved from the place of rendezvous to the head of Locheil, about\r\nnine miles from Fort William, and as the difficulty of finding horses\r\nand the badness of the roads in this country were equally\r\nunsurmountable, of twenty large swevel guns he made twelve be buried in\r\na bog about a mile from the place where he first erected his standard.\r\nHe had no sooner arrived at the above mentioned place than he received\r\nintelligence of G[eneral] C[ope] having moved north ward and at the same\r\ntime had a copy of the proclamation sent which had been ishued by order\r\nof the Lords Justices, affixing thirty thousand pound upon his head....\r\n\r\nUpon seeing it he was heard to say that tho it was true that a reward\r\nhad been likewise set upon his father\u0027s head in the year 1715, that yet\r\nhe imagined that in proportion as the world grew in politeness they had\r\ndone so in humanity, that it were unjust to call the ancients rude and\r\nsavage etc., when no example could be given of their taking so mean and\r\nunmanly a way to get rid of their enemy. That he should have been far\r\nfrom ever thinking of such a device to exterminate the E[lector]s family\r\ndid his success depend upon it, but at the same time he could not in\r\njustice to him self get[85] by offering the same reward in his turn. Tho\r\nif he could allow himself to think that any of his friends could be so\r\nabandoned as to be guilty of so execrable a deed for the sum proposed,\r\nthat he would alter the sum to thirty pound instead of thirty thousand,\r\nand then ordered a proclamation of the same nature to be drawn, which\r\nwas signed and published two days after.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] \u003d avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE CAPTURE OF EDINBURGH (SEPTEMBER).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The History of the Rebellion in the year 1745_, p. 86,\r\n    by John Home, Esq. (London: 1802.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night between the 15^th and 16^th of September passed without\r\ndisturbance. Six or seven hundred men, consisting of the Trained Bands,\r\nthe Edinburgh volunteers, and some volunteers who came in from the\r\ntowns of Musselburgh and Dalkeith, were upon guard at the different\r\ngates of the city. On Monday the 16^th the rebels advanced slowly\r\ntowards Edinburgh, giving time for the terror of their approach to\r\noperate upon the minds of unwarlike citizens, in a divided city. Between\r\nten and eleven o\u0027clock in the forenoon, a message was delivered from the\r\nyoung Pretender to the people of Edinburgh, acquainting them that if\r\nthey would admit him peaceably into the city, they should be civilly\r\ndealt with, if not they must lay their account with military execution.\r\n\r\nInstantly the clamour rose, and crowds of people ran about the streets\r\ncrying out, that it was madness to think of resistance, since the\r\ndragoons were fled; and some of them meeting Provost Stuart, as he\r\nreturned from the West Port (where he had gone to give orders after the\r\nretreat of the dragoons), followed him to the Parliament Square,\r\nbeseeching him not to persist in defending the town, for if he did they\r\nshould all be murdered. The Provost reprimanded them; and went to the\r\nGoldsmiths\u0027 Hall, where the Magistrates and Town Council were assembled,\r\nwith a good many of the inhabitants. A deputation was sent to the\r\nJustice Clerk, the Advocate, and the Solicitor, to entreat that they\r\nwould come and assist the Council with their advice. The deputies\r\nreturned, and reported that all these gentlemen had left the town.\r\nProvost Stuart then sent for the captains of the volunteers, and the\r\nTrained Bands, and desired to have their opinion concerning the defence\r\nof the town. The officers said very little, and seemed to be at a loss\r\nwhat opinion to give; other people in the meeting made speeches for and\r\nagainst the defence of the town, not without reproach and abuse on both\r\nsides. The crowd encreased to such a degree, that it became necessary to\r\nadjourn to a larger place, and the meeting adjourned to the New Church\r\nAisle, which was immediately filled with people, the most part of whom\r\ncalled to give up the town; that it was impossible to defend it. Those\r\nwho attempted to speak against the general opinion, were borne down with\r\nnoise and clamour....\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\u0027clock at night the deputies[86] returned, and brought a\r\nletter in answer to the message sent by them.\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Highness the Prince Regent thinks his Manifesto, and the King\r\nhis father\u0027s declaration already published, a sufficient capitulation\r\nfor all His Majesty\u0027s subjects to accept of with joy. His present\r\ndemands are to be received into the city, as the son and representative\r\nof the King his father, and obeyed as such when there, His Royal\r\nHighness supposes, that since the receipt of his letter to the Provost,\r\nno arms or ammunition have been suffered to be carried off or concealed,\r\nand will expect a particular account of all things of that nature.\r\nLastly, he expects a positive answer, before two o\u0027clock in the morning,\r\notherwise he will think himself obliged to take measures conform.\r\n\r\n\"At Gray\u0027s Mill, 16^th September, 1745. By his Highness\u0027s command.\r\n\r\n                                        \"(Signed) J. Murray.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this letter was read, Provost Stuart said, there was one condition\r\nin it, which he would die rather than submit to, which was receiving the\r\nson of the Pretender as Prince Regent; for he was bound by oath to\r\nanother master. After long deliberation it was determined to send out\r\ndeputies once more, to beg a suspension of hostilities till nine o\u0027clock\r\nin the morning, that the Magistrates might have an opportunity of\r\nconversing with the citizens, most of whom were gone to bed. The\r\ndeputies were also instructed to receive an explanation of what was\r\nmeant by receiving Charles as Prince Regent.\r\n\r\nAbout two o\u0027clock in the morning the deputies set out in a hackney coach\r\nfor Gray\u0027s Mill; when they arrived there they prevailed upon Lord George\r\nMurray to second their application for a delay; but Charles refused to\r\ngrant it; and the deputies were ordered in his name to get them gone.\r\n\r\nThe coach brought them back to Edinburgh, set them down in the\r\nHigh-Street, and then drove towards the Canongate. When the Nether Bow\r\nport was opened to let out the coach, 800 Highlanders, led by Cameron of\r\nLocheil, rushed in and took possession of the city.\r\n\r\nIt was about five o\u0027clock in the morning when the rebels entered\r\nEdinburgh. They immediately sent parties to all the other gates, and to\r\nthe town guard, who making the soldiers upon duty prisoners, occupied\r\ntheir posts as quietly as one guard relieves another. When the\r\ninhabitants of Edinburgh awakened in the morning, they found that the\r\nHighlanders were masters of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[86] Who had been sent to parley with the rebels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. PRINCE CHARLES AT HOLYROOD (SEPTEMBER).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The History of the Rebellion in the year 1745_, p. 99,\r\n    by John Home, Esq. (London: 1802.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\u0027clock[87] the main body of the rebels marching by\r\nDuddingston (to avoid being fired upon by the Castle) entered the King\u0027s\r\nPark, and halted in the hollow between the hills, under the peak called\r\nArthur\u0027s seat. By and by Charles came down to the Duke\u0027s Walk,\r\naccompanied by the Highland Chiefs, and other commanders of his army.\r\n\r\nThe Park was full of people (amongst whom was the author of this\r\nhistory,) all of them impatient to see this extraordinary person. The\r\nfigure and presence of Charles Stuart were not ill suited to his lofty\r\npretensions. He was in the prime of youth, tall and handsome, of a fair\r\ncomplexion; he had a light coloured periwig with his own hair combed\r\nover the front: he wore the Highland dress, that is a tartan short coat\r\nwithout the plaid, a blue bonnet on his head, and on his breast the star\r\nof the order of St. Andrew. Charles stood some time in the park to show\r\nhimself to the people; and then, though he was very near the palace,\r\nmounted his horse, either to render himself more conspicuous, or because\r\nhe rode well, and looked graceful on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobites were charmed with his appearance: they compared him to\r\nRobert the Bruce, whom he resembled (they said) in his figure as in his\r\nfortune. The Whigs looked upon him with other eyes. They acknowledged\r\nthat he was a goodly person; but they observed, that even in that\r\ntriumphant hour, when he was about to enter the palace of his fathers,\r\nthe air of his countenance was languid and melancholy: that he looked\r\nlike a gentleman and man of fashion, but not like a hero or conqueror.\r\nHence they formed their conclusions that the enterprize was above the\r\npitch of his mind; and that his heart was not great enough for the\r\nsphere in which he moved. When Charles came to the palace, he\r\ndismounted, and walked along the piazza, towards the apartment of the\r\nDuke of Hamilton. When he was near the door, which stood open to receive\r\nhim, a gentleman stepped out of the crowd, drew his sword, and raising\r\nhis arm aloft, walked up stairs before Charles. The person who enlisted\r\nhimself in this manner, was James Hepburn of Keith, whose name will be\r\nmentioned again more than once....\r\n\r\nThe Highlanders, when they entered the town in the morning, had secured\r\nthe Heralds and Pursuivants: at midday they surrounded the Cross with a\r\nbody of armed men, and obliged the Heralds to proclaim King James, to\r\nread the Commission of Regency, and the Declaration, dated at Rome, in\r\nDecember 1743, with a Manifesto in the name of Charles Prince Regent,\r\ndated at Paris, 16th of May, 1745. An immense multitude witnessed this\r\nceremony, which was performed at noon. The populace of a great city, who\r\nhuzza for any thing that brings them together, huzzaed; and a number of\r\nladies in the windows strained their voices with acclamation, and their\r\narms with waving white handkerchiefs in honour of the day. These\r\ndemonstrations of joy, amongst people of condition, were chiefly\r\nconfined to one sex; few gentlemen were to be seen on the streets, or in\r\nthe windows; and even amongst the inferior people, many shewed their\r\ndislike by a stubborn silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] On September 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE.

(Edinburgh: Scottish Historical Society, 1898.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn thursday the 19th, in the evening, the Chevalier had certain\r\nintelligence that G^ll Cope had marched that morning from Dunbar, and\r\nwas to encamp that night at Haddingtown, upon which he immediately gave\r\norders for the guards of the City to retire early next morning, and he\r\nwent himself that night to Duddingston....\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the orders given on the morning of the twentieth the\r\nguards retired from the City and joined the army at Duddingston, and\r\nbrought alongst with them some surgeons, with whom the army was then\r\nvery ill provided, and some coaches and chaises were likewise ordered\r\nfor the conveniency of the wounded, so certain was the prospect of a\r\nbattle, and even a successful one. Thus all things being prepared about\r\nnine in the morning, after receiving an exact account of the number of\r\nthe enemy taken at Haddington, the Chevalier put himself at the head of\r\nhis small army, drawing his sword, said with a very determined\r\ncountenance, Gentlemen, I have flung away the scabbard, with God\u0027s\r\nassistance I don\u0027t doubt of making you a free and happy people, Mr. Cope\r\nshall not escape us as he did in the Highlands, and then began his\r\nmarch, ordering the few horse, he then had, not above fifty in number,\r\nto advance at some small distance in front, and to detach a few to\r\ndiscover the enemy\u0027s march. In this manner, with the Camerons in front,\r\nhe marched in good order, crossing Musselburgh bridge by Pinky park\r\nwall. By this time the party of horse sent intelligence that G^ll Cope\r\nwas nigh to Tranent, from which the Chevalier conjectured that he would\r\nengage him on the muir to the west ward of that village, and therefore\r\nquickened his march to prevent his gaining the brow of Carberry hill\r\nbefore him, but before he had near reached the top of the hill he was\r\ntold that Sir John had marched to the left, and posted himself in a low\r\nground betwixt Preston and Seaton. This naturally led him to imagine\r\nthat he intended to avoid coming to action; and made him determine, if\r\npossible, to attack him the same day. With this view he advanced to the\r\nhill and drew up his army opposite to G^ll Cope, who was formed in the\r\nlow ground before mentioned in two lines, with the two regiments of\r\nDragoons on his wings. So soon as the Chevalier had taken a view of the\r\nenemy he judged it impossible to attack them in the post they was then\r\nin, having a deep ditch in their front which runs along the high road,\r\nwhere he must have sustained great loss before he could pass it; but\r\nbeing determined that at no rate the enemy should give him the slip a\r\nsecond time, he ordered a detachment to take possession of the Church\r\nyard which commanded their camp on the left, and as that seemed the only\r\nside where it was possible to come at them, he enquired if there was\r\nnone in the army acquainted with the country to know if the ground would\r\nallow him to attack them on the left. There happened to be a gentleman\r\nin the army of that county, who told him that there was only one pass on\r\nthe left whereby not guarded he could come to them, upon which he\r\nordered it to be reconnoitred, and finding it neglected he ordered a\r\ndetachment of 500 men to be posted upon the high road to the west of\r\nPreston to prevent the enemys retiring by that road to Edinburgh, and\r\nrecalling the detachment from the Church yard he marched his army\r\neastward by the town of Tranent, and drew up in one line opposite to the\r\nflank of the enemy, who upon that motion made a half wheel to face him,\r\nexpecting, as it was imagined, that he then designed to attack them, and\r\nwhich L. G. M--y[88] proposed, as the Highlanders were then full of\r\nspirits, and above all things desirous to engage; but the night being\r\nthen far advanced, the Chevalier thought it better to delay coming to an\r\nengagement till next morning, not knowing what might be the consequence\r\nof a rencounter in the night should the enemy, if beat, rally and come\r\nupon him while in confusion and not able to get his people together,\r\nknowing how difficult it was to keep irregular troops together in a body\r\nafter an action, so resolved to delay it till early next morning, and\r\nordered his army to halt upon the ground about three or four hundred\r\nyards from the enemy, and to continue under arms to be ready to march\r\nupon a minutes warning.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly lay close in order of battle the whole night without\r\nthe least whisper or noise to be heard, while G^ll Cope made some fires\r\nin his camp and threw a few shells, which did no hurt. Having continued\r\nin this position for some time, he was informed that the detachment of\r\nfive hundred Atholl men which he had posted upon the west side of the\r\nvillage of Preston had rejoined the army; this made him very uneasy\r\nleast the enemy had filed off during the night by that road and had\r\ntaken possession of the City of Edin^r, to prevent which and to\r\nintercept the runaways had enduced him to make that disposition. He at\r\nfirst seemed resolved to make them return, but when he reflected that\r\ntheir march, if discovered by the enemy, might induce them to believe it\r\nwas the whole army, and occasion them to alter their disposition or\r\noccasion any confusion or distrust amongst his own people, he judged it\r\nsafer and better to put up with the disappointment and continue the rest\r\nof his plan, tho he could not help complaining that his orders had been\r\nneglected in so material a point.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this _faux pas_, he kept in very high spirits the rest\r\nof the night, laying on the ground without any covering but his plaid,\r\nand in the morning, about an hour before daylight, made his army, guided\r\nby the gentleman above mentioned, march from the left in three columns,\r\nmaking the left of the first line the right of the army for the attack,\r\nwhich motion, tho perhaps irregular, was yet necessary, and executed\r\nwith so much order and silence that the small body of horse posted in\r\nthe rear knew nothing of their march; the officer on duty, either\r\nthrough forgetfulness or that he thought they could be of no service,\r\nneglected to give them orders to march. In this order he marched to the\r\nenemy, passing a deep bog with out the least observation. The right,\r\ncomposed of the M^cdon^ds of Glengarry and Clanronald, was commanded by\r\nthe D. of P.,[89] and the left, commanded by L.G.M.,[90] which had made\r\nthe right the preceding day, consisted of the Camerons and Steuarts of\r\nAppin. The third column, which was made up of the Atholl men, was\r\ncommanded by My L[ord] N[airn]. So soon as the two first columns had\r\npassed the bog, they formed and marched straight to the enemy, who by\r\nthis time had formed and presented themselves in the same order of\r\nbattle they had appeared the day before. By this time the third column\r\nhad likewise passed and formed themselves about four score yards in the\r\nrear of the first line; rather too near, if the ground would have\r\nallowed of a more regular disposition. The left, when pretty near the\r\nenemy, finding themselves outwinged, made a motion to front the\r\nartillery, which occasioned a gap in the centre, but marching up\r\nbriskly, they received one fire of the cannon, which did little hurt,\r\nand then receiving a fire from the foot, they gave a loud huzza,\r\nreturning the fire, upon which Gairdner\u0027s dragoons run off, and the\r\nHighlanders, throwing away their muskets, attacked the foot with\r\nincredible impetuosity, who immediately gave ground. Upon the left of\r\nthe enemy the resistance, if such behaviour merits the name, was much\r\nless, for before the D. of P. was within three score yards of them,\r\nHamilton\u0027s dragoons began to reel and run off before they could receive\r\nhis fire; the foot likewise fired too soon, and almost all turned their\r\nbacks before the Highlanders could engage them with their swords. In a\r\nfew minutes the rout was total; the dragoons on the right run off by the\r\nhigh road through the town of Preston, and those on the left by the\r\nshore towards the east; the few of the foot that saved themselves\r\nescaped by Preston Park, the wall of which had been broke down the day\r\nbefore by G^ll Cope\u0027s orders. All the baggage of the army was placed in\r\na yard upon the left of their army, guarded by two companies of L.\r\nLowdon\u0027s regiment, where so soon as the action was over, Cap^t Bazil\r\nCochran of Coll. Lees[91] was sent by L.G.M. to tell them that if they\r\nwould immediately surrender as prisoners of war they should be used as\r\nsuch, if not, they would be immediately attacked and no quarter given,\r\nupon which they readily gave up their arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] Lord George Murray.\r\n\r\n[89] Duke of Perth.\r\n\r\n[90] Lord George Murray.\r\n\r\n[91] Lee\u0027s Regiment, the 44th, now the Essex Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF. \"JOHNNIE COPE.\"[92]\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The Jacobite Songs and Ballads of Scotland from 1688 to\r\n    1746_, p. 181.

INVASION OF ENGLAND (NOVEMBER-DECEMBER).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memorial: Lochgary to Glengary_, printed as a postscript\r\n    to W. B. Blaikie\u0027s _Itinerary of Prince Charles Edward Stuart from\r\n    his Landing in Scotland, July, 1745, to his Departure in September,\r\n    1746_, p. 116. (Edinburgh: Scottish Historical Society, 1897.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of Nov^r the Prince called a council o\u0027 war, wherein\r\nH.R.H. determined to march into England with the forces he then had, and\r\nnot to wait those who were coming up, but ordered them to follow.\r\n\r\nWe marched on without halt till we came to Brampton, near Carlile, where\r\nthe Prince rested with part o\u0027 the army, and order\u0027d the siege of\r\nCarlile, which surrender\u0027d after four days\u0027 siege. The next day after\r\nthe surrender, the Prince enter\u0027d the town with his whole army, where\r\nH.R.H. remain\u0027d some days. From thence he march\u0027d straight with his\r\nwhole army till he arrived at Darby, where he rested two days; and\r\nH.R.H. called a council o\u0027 war, and finding most of the private people\r\nof the army\u0027s opinion to be rather to retreat than goe forward (tho\u0027 at\r\nthe same time H.R.H.\u0027s opinion and inclination was to goe forward), he\r\nagreed to a retreat. Consequently, we began our retreat next day.[97]\r\nLord George Murray, who always had the rear, chose our regiment for the\r\nrearguard, tho\u0027 it was not our turn. When we came to Kendal, we had\r\naccounts of the enemy\u0027s being close in our rear; and our regiment\u0027s\r\nhaving the rearguard, and likewise the charge of the artillery. The\r\nPrince marched on with the army till they arrived at Penrith, and the\r\nweather very terrible, the rear could not reach Chap[98] that night,\r\nwhich is halfway twixt Penrith and Kendal. Lord George took up our\r\nquarters in a little villiage, where we rested that night on our arms,\r\nwithout thro\u0027ing a stitch of cloaths,[99] as we were sure the enemy was\r\nvery near us. Next day we marched by daylight, and for want of proper\r\nhorses the artillery was very fashious,[100] and a last load with cannon\r\nshot happening to break on the road, upon Lord George\u0027s giving a hearty\r\ndram to the men, they carried, some one, some two, some three of the\r\nshot, with all their arms and acuterments. All this day some of the\r\nenemy\u0027s horse were in our rear, but made no attack. This night we came\r\nto Chap, and after placing our guards and sentinelles, Lord George, the\r\nother gentlemen, and I, took up our quarters about 8 o\u0027clock at\r\nnight.... By the break o\u0027 day Lord George order\u0027d to beat to arms, and\r\norder\u0027d the artillery on before. We marched on, expecting every minut\r\nthe enemy wou\u0027d be up with us, having none with us but your regiment and\r\nabout one hundred and twenty of Roy Stuart\u0027s regiment. About halfway to\r\nPenrith, we saw at some distance, to the number of about 5 or 600 horse,\r\nwhom we took to be part of our own army; but upon coming near us they\r\nmade a form to attack us. These were militia sent to intercept our\r\nmarch; but by a detachment we sent to attack them giving them a smart\r\nfire, which kill\u0027d two or three of them, they were routed, and fled, so\r\nwe march\u0027d on untill we came to Clifton, within two short miles of\r\nPenrith, where the Prince and his army lay. Here Lord George got account\r\nthat some of the enemy were come to the house of Lowtherhall, about a\r\nmile\u0027s distance on our left. He desired me to ask the men (as he knew\r\nthey were fatigued) if they were willing to attack that house. They\r\nanswer\u0027d me that they were most willing. Upon which we marched and\r\nsurrounded the house, and only found in it one officer, with a footman\r\nof the Duke of Cumberland\u0027s, whom he had sent before to take up quarters\r\nfor him. Upon our return to Clifton, we perceived the enemy to the\r\nnumber of about 3000 horse, advanced by this time within 1/4 of a mile\r\nof Clifton. Cluny and his M^cPhersons, to about the number of three\r\nhundred men, happened to be at this village. Lord George ordered them on\r\none post on the side of the road, and our regiment on another on the\r\nother side. It was then about nightset, when the enemy, being all horse,\r\ndismounted--I can\u0027t condescend on their number, being then dark--and\r\nattack\u0027d the M^cPhersons, who received them, and after a close fire for\r\nsome time on both sides, the enemy were repulsed. Upon this they sent a\r\nstronger body to attack us both, which came directly up to us, and it\r\nbeing then quite dark, they coming very close to us, we only heard the\r\nnoise of their boots, and could plainly discern their yellow belts. We\r\nfirst received their full fire, which did us little damage. We\r\nimmediately gave them ours, and then attacked them sword in hand, and\r\noblidged them to retreat with a considerable loss.\r\n\r\nLord George then marched with us and the M^cPhersons into the town,\r\nwhere we found the whole army ready to march for Carlisle, so that we\r\nhad neither time to refresh ourselves, or men. So you may judge our\r\ncondition, having marched t[w]o days without resting from Kendal to\r\nPenrith, which is long 20 miles, and, without halt, 16 more on to\r\nCarlisle, all without any sleep and very little provision; yet we brot\r\nall the artillery safe, and lost very few men at the attack at Clifton.\r\nI received a small wound there myself in the knee, and no other\r\ngentleman touched. We stay\u0027d two days at Carlisle. The third day in the\r\nmorning by break o\u0027 day we marched, expecting surely to meet Cumberland\r\nthat day to give him battle; but perceiving no enemy, march\u0027d forward,\r\nand that night crossed the Esk. H.R.H. continued on his march without\r\nany remarkable occurencies till he arrived safe with his army at\r\nGlasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[97] December 6, \"Black Friday.\"\r\n\r\n[98] Shap.\r\n\r\n[99] _I.e._, without undressing.\r\n\r\n[100] Troublesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH. THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK (JANUARY, 1746).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The Lockhart Papers: containing ... also Journals and\r\n    Memoirs of the Young Pretender\u0027s Expedition in 1745, by Highland\r\n    Officers in his Army_, vol. ii., p. 499. (London: 1817.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of January we marched from Glasgow to Cumbernauld and from\r\nthence to Falkirk. Next day orders were sent to the army at Perth to\r\njoin us and with the artillery to invest Stirling Castle. After staying\r\nabout a week, four of our six Highland regiments which were in England\r\nwere ordered to march to Linlithgow under night, both to levy the\r\npublick money and carry off the provisions which had been ordered to be\r\nprovided for the English army now convened about Edinburgh under the\r\ncommand of General Hawley who was advancing towards us.... The Duke of\r\nPerth commanded the siege of Stirling Castle, the Prince\u0027s headquarters\r\nbeing at Bannockburn near Falkirk....\r\n\r\nGeneral Hawley (who had been joined by the Argyleshire Highlanders to\r\nthe number of about twelve hundred under General Campbell) with the\r\nGovernment\u0027s troops encamped a little northwest from the toun of\r\nFalkirk. The P. finding General Hawley did not move from his camp at\r\nFalkirk to attack him, held a council of war, January the seventeenth,\r\nabout midday, wherein it was resolved to march and attack Hawley.\r\nAccordingly we set out in two columns, and under the cover of the Tor\r\nwood passed the water of Carron at Dunipace; moving on very quickly to\r\ngain the hill above and lying on the south west of Falkirk our two\r\ncolumns kept at an equal distance of about two hundred paces till we\r\ncame in sight of the enemy about a mile and a half distant from us. At\r\nthe same time that we began our march Lord John Drummond with most of\r\nthe horse had gone to reconnoitre the enemy, and made a movement as if\r\nhe intended to march by the high way through the Tor wood close up to\r\nthem, and this might occasion what some accounts tell us of General\r\nHawley\u0027s perceiving a body of the Highlanders in the Tor wood, took this\r\nappearance to be our whole army, and finding they did not advance,\r\nallowed his troops to dine in their camp.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our main body; whilst we were making up towards the\r\nhill above Falkirk (as was said) the enemy at last perceived us and\r\nimmediately their three regiments of dragoons were ordered up to gain\r\nthe ground upon us and hinder our forming till their foot should form\r\nand their cannon be brought up the hill to support them. The P. seeing\r\nthe intention of the enemy, ordered 1500 or 2000 of his Highlanders,\r\nled on by Lord George Murray and Lochiel, to advance and drive the\r\ndragoons from the eminence they had possessed, till the main body of our\r\nmen should come up, and to form the right of our army. This attack upon\r\nthe dragoons was very quick and regular; as we came within pistolshot\r\nthe dragoons made up to us at a full trot, thinking to bear us down by\r\ntheir weight, and break us at once, and indeed being well mounted and\r\naccoutred they made a glorious show, sufficient to have struck other\r\nhearts than ours with a pannick. We received them, however, with a very\r\nsmart fire, upon which they reeled and broke into several divisions,\r\nsome falling back upon their own foot on the left, others flying out of\r\nthe field, whilst one body of them fled off to the right betwixt the\r\nfront lines of both armies, which by this time were formed.... As the\r\nenemy\u0027s dragoons rode off to their right betwixt the lines, our men ran\r\neagerly in pursuit of them, but were much surprised to find themselves\r\nstopped by our generals and officers, who with difficulty restrained\r\nthem with their drawn swords and cocked pistols, conjuring them to\r\nreturn to their ground or they would be undone. As the dragoons in their\r\nflight betwixt the lines passed by our left wing they could not forbear\r\ngiving them part of their fire likewise. Our left had not been fully\r\nformed when the attack begun on the right; a considerable body of the\r\nenemy\u0027s horse came up also to attack them, but receiving part of the\r\nfire of our left they broke and run off; their infantry coming in upon\r\nthat side were opposed by some of our battalions, who receiving the\r\nenemy\u0027s fire went in amongst them sword in hand and drove them down the\r\nhill with great impetuosity and slaughter, but not being in sight of our\r\nright (by reason of the unevenness of the ground) they made a halt till\r\nsuch time as the two wings should join in the centre and the second line\r\ncome up. His R. H., whose attention was turned to all quarters observing\r\nthat our left wing was outlined by the enemy, sent Brigadier Stapleton\r\nwith the pickets of the Irish Brigade and some other battalions from the\r\nsecond line, which extended our first line and recovered the disorder\r\nwe were like to be put into. Then our whole army marched down towards\r\nthe enemy, who were retreating on all sides in great disorder, but by\r\nreason of the unevenness of the ground and night coming on with a storm\r\nof wind and rain they could not overtake them, as they were positively\r\nordered to keep their ranks. The enemy, finding they could neither\r\npossess nor save their camp, set fire to their tents and retreated with\r\ngreat precipitation towards Linlithgow, and were just got to the east\r\nend of the toun of Falkirk when Lord John Drummond entered it on that\r\nside, Lord George Murray in the middle, and Lochiel in the west end of\r\nthe toun. We took most of their cannon, ammunition, and baggage which\r\nthey had not themselves destroyed. We reckoned about seven hundred of\r\nthe enemy taken prisoners and about six hundred men and between thirty\r\nor forty officers killed. We had not above forty men killed on our side,\r\namongst whom were two or three captains and some subaltern officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

JOHN CAMERON, Presbyterian Preacher and Chaplain at\r\nFort-William._\r\n\r\nThe retreat from Stirling was made with the utmost hurry and confusion.\r\nThe evening before, Mr. O\u0027Sullivan wrote from Bannockburn to Lord John\r\nDrummond ordering him to leave Stirling and cross the Forth by break of\r\nday, which order his lordship obeyed, and by 5 in the morning marched.\r\nThis surprized the Highlanders, to whose officers it appears these\r\norders were not communicate, and made them believe the enemy was near\r\nthem, which occasioned such an universal consternation that they went\r\nfrom Stirling as everyone was ready, and left most of their baggage, all\r\nthe cloaths they brought from Glasgow, and some of their arms.\r\n\r\nLochiel, who had been wounded at Falkirk, not being able to ride or\r\nwalk, went in a chaise with Mrs. Murray, and was driving through St.\r\nNinian\u0027s when the church blew up. Some of the stones came very near\r\nthem. The horses startled and threw Mrs. Murray on the street, where she\r\nlay speechless till she was taken up by some of the men. Had there been\r\nany intention to blow up the church, doubtless Lochiel, one of their\r\nprincipal officers, and the Secretary\u0027s lady had been apprized of it and\r\nput on their guard to avoid danger.\r\n\r\nWhen the Prince join\u0027d the body of the army a Council of War was held,\r\nin which it was debated whether the army should march in a body to\r\nInverness by Aberdeen or take the Highland road, by which the chiefs\r\ncould, with the greater ease, get such of their men to rejoin them as\r\nhad gone home with plunder after the battle of Falkirk, which would\r\nconsiderably increase their army. The low-country men were of the former\r\nopinion, the Highlanders of the latter. It was put to the vote, and the\r\nlatter carried it by a great majority. However, the Prince was positive\r\nfor the Aberdeen road, with which Lochiel complied. But Cluny, going\r\nout, met Mr. Murray, and told him it was surprizing the Prince should be\r\nso positive in a thing contrary to reason and his own instinct,\r\nespecially when a great majority of the Council of War were of another\r\nopinion. His expressing himself with a little warmth made Mr. Murray\r\nspeak to Sir Thomas Sheridan, who went to the Prince and prevailed upon\r\nhim to agree with what had been the opinion of the Council of War. He\r\nmarched with the Highlanders the Highland road by Ruthven in Badenoch,\r\nto Inverness, where it was resolved to attack Fort Augustus and Fort\r\nWilliam. Of either I can give no distinct account, but that the first\r\nwas taken, and the siege of the other deserted.\r\n\r\nEarl Cromertie and others were sent to different countries to cover the\r\nrising of some and prevent that of others. This weakened the army, and\r\ntho\u0027 many joined the day before the battle of Culloden, a great number\r\ndid not. Earl of Cromertie, tho\u0027 many expresses were sent to order his\r\nreturning to Inverness, in place of doing as commanded, was surprized\r\nand taken prisoner; and these that did join were much fatigued. None had\r\ngot pay after they left Tay bridge in their march north, and they were\r\nstraightened in provisions for some days before the battle. Cumberland\u0027s\r\narmy was not opposed in passing the Spey, tho\u0027 a considerable force had\r\nbeen sent there for that end.[101] The Prince was in danger of being\r\ntaken at MacIntosh\u0027s house, and his safety was chiefly owing to a\r\nmistake of Earl of Loudon\u0027s men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] This is incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. THE EVE OF CULLODEN (APRIL, 1746).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Memoirs of Sir Robert Strange, Knight, and of his\r\n    Brother-in-Law, Andrew Lumisden, Private Secretary to the Stuart\r\n    Princes_, vol. i., p. 54, by James Dennistoun, of Dennistoun.\r\n    (London: 1855.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of my undertaking[102] when, all of a sudden, news\r\nwas brought to Inverness that the Duke of Cumberland, with his army, had\r\npassed the Spey on the 13th of April. The town was in a general alarm,\r\nand even in confusion. Nothing was heard but the noise of bagpipes, the\r\nbeating of drums, and the clash of arms. The field of Culloden was the\r\nfollowing day to be the general rendezvous, and every individual betook\r\nhimself to his corps.\r\n\r\nThe army was now mustering upon the field, it being the 14th; but\r\nunfortunately we had not been joined by a considerable number of our\r\nmen, who were actually upon their march from different parts of the\r\ncountry, and would have been up in the course of a few days. The whole\r\nof the Macphersons, a considerable body of the Frasers, some few of the\r\nMacintoshes, in general all the Mackenzies, and several other bodies of\r\nmen who had been raised in the more northern counties, had all received\r\nrepeated expresses, and were hastening to join the army. In this\r\nsituation, divested as it were of part of our numbers, we hourly\r\nexpected the Duke. He had come on to Nairn on the 14th, and was there\r\nhalting. There was even no appearance of his moving, the 15th being his\r\nbirthday. In the afternoon of that day, the Prince had summoned a\r\ncouncil of war to be held upon the field, and had proposed a plan of a\r\nmarch under cloud of night, to attack the Duke\u0027s army by surprise, and\r\nto force his camp. This plan was worthy even of any of the greatest\r\nheroes of antiquity, and met with general approbation, particularly\r\namongst the clans. The council remained long in deliberating in what\r\nmanner it was to be conducted. Two essential things, secrecy and\r\nexpedition, were the great objects to be observed. There was only one\r\nroad to Nairn, which was the high road; and this being covered in many\r\nplaces with villages, it was essential to avoid it, to prevent any\r\ninformation being carried to the Duke\u0027s army. The next alternative, and\r\nindeed the only one, was to attempt a way along the foot of a ridge of\r\nmountains which fronted the sea, but had scarcely ever been trod by\r\nhuman foot, and was known by the name of the Moor-road. It would have\r\nbrought us in upon that part of the enemy\u0027s camp from which they could\r\napprehend no danger. It lengthened indeed the road, which, in the\r\nsequel, and from the shortness of the night, proved our misfortune.\r\n\r\nBefore the council broke up, every regiment as it were had his place\r\nassigned him in the order of the march. The van was commanded by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, who, with about one-third of the army, was to have passed\r\nthe water of Nairn about two miles distant from the town, and who,\r\nunexpected by the enemy, was to have invested the Duke\u0027s quarters, and\r\nto have made him prisoner. The remaining two-thirds, commanded by the\r\nDuke of Perth and Lord John Drummond, were to have attacked them from\r\nthe plain, which, in all probability, would have been carried sword in\r\nhand. It is to be remarked that the same army had been already surprised\r\nat Falkirk.\r\n\r\nNight coming on--and not sooner could the army begin its march, to\r\nprevent the country people from being alarmed, or any intelligence being\r\ncarried to the enemy,--part of our numbers, weak as we were, was under a\r\nnecessity of being left on the field, in order to save appearances, and\r\nlight up fires, as had been done the preceding evening, and to prevent\r\nstragglers, if any there were, forming unnecessary conjectures. The\r\nnight was favourable to our wishes, but alas! such a road was never\r\ntravelled; the men in general were frequently up to the ankles, and the\r\nhorses in many places extricated themselves with difficulty. In this\r\nmanner were we retarded almost the whole of the night; notwithstanding\r\nof which, an uncommon spirit supported itself throughout the army.\r\n\r\nIt was now the 16th of April, when day began to break about four in the\r\nmorning. It was indeed a dreadful knell to us, being as yet above four\r\nlong miles from Nairn; nor did we know what sort of road we had yet to\r\nencounter. Appearances became serious, each was whispering to his\r\nneighbour, and, so far as countenances could be descried, disappointment\r\nwas evidently marked. During this critical moment of suspense, what was\r\nto be done? A halt took place; a council was called as soon as the\r\ngeneral officers could be got together. The morning was fine, and the\r\nday was ushering in apace; it required but little time to deliberate,\r\nand finding it impossible to attack the Duke by surprise, it was judged\r\nexpedient, for the safety of the army, to give up the enterprise, and\r\nreturn to the field of Culloden. Thus were our hopes disappointed. We\r\nsaw, as it were before us, the glorious prize; but we durst not\r\nencounter it, for there is almost a moral certainty that we should have\r\nbeen cut off to a man. The enemy was early in motion, must have seen us\r\nat a considerable distance, and received us upon the points of their\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[102] Strange, an expert engraver, was printing Jacobite bank-notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nK. THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_Idem._, p. 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us for an instant review the situation of this army.[103] They had,\r\nfor many weeks before the battle, been reduced to a short allowance of\r\nbread; when I say bread, I mean oatmeal, for they had no other. Must not\r\nthis have enfeebled their bodies? Their treasury-chest had been nearly\r\nexhausted: they had received but little money: of course considerable\r\narrears were owing them. They had passed the 14th and following night\r\nunder arms upon the field of battle, every instant expecting the Duke.\r\nUpon the night of the 15th, which was the eve of the battle, they had\r\nperformed the march I have described. Judge, then, what was to be\r\nexpected from such an army, worn out with fatigue, and at this moment\r\nshort of the common necessaries of life, and outnumbered upwards of two\r\nto one by their enemies; for the Duke\u0027s army consisted of at least\r\neleven thousand men; that of the Prince did not exceed six, of which we\r\nshall find at least a thousand during the action were asleep in Culloden\r\nparks. What, then, can justify the deliberate folly and madness of\r\nfighting under such circumstances? But our time was come. We were at\r\nvariance within ourselves: Irish intriguers and French politics were too\r\npredominant in our councils. These gentlemen, forsooth, considered\r\nthemselves as to be but prisoners of war, whilst every other individual\r\nwere fighting with halters round their necks. General appearances upon\r\nthe field of battle were much against us. No line was as yet formed; the\r\nmen were standing in clusters; and stragglers in small numbers were\r\ncoming up from all quarters. Overpowered with fatigue, they had stopped\r\neverywhere on the road, and were now joining the army.\r\n\r\nIt being determined to give battle to the Duke, no time was now lost in\r\nforming the lines, and in making every proper disposition. The right of\r\nthe army, commanded by Lord George Murray, was composed of his own\r\nregiment of Athol, the Camerons, Stuarts of Appin, one battalion of the\r\nFrasers, and the Macintoshes. The left wing, commanded by the Duke of\r\nPerth, consisted of the MacDonalds of Glengarry, Keppoch, and\r\nClanronald, two companies of MacLeans, two of MacLeods, and the\r\nFarquharsons. The second line, commanded by Lord John Drummond and\r\nMajor-general Stapleton, consisted of the Irish pickets, the regiments\r\nof Lord Ogilvy, Lord Lewis Gordon, Duke of Perth, and Lord John\r\nDrummond. On the right wing, behind the second line, was a troop of\r\nFitz-James\u0027 horse, and on the left part of the horse-guards, Perthshire\r\nsquadron, and hussars. The regiment of Kilmarnock\u0027s foot-guards, and\r\nColonel John Roy Stuart, with such of the men as had no guns, formed a\r\nsort of reserve. The Prince, attended by his aides-de-camp, and Lord\r\nElcho\u0027s guards, placed himself towards the centre, behind the first\r\nline. We had six pieces of cannon; two placed on the right, two on the\r\nleft, and two in the centre of the front line.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland drew up his army in three lines. The first,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant-general the Earl of Albemarle, consisted of the\r\nregiments of Burrel, Monro, Scot\u0027s Fusiliers, Price, Cholmondley and St.\r\nClair. The second, commanded by Major-general Huske, consisted of the\r\nregiments of Wolfe, Ligonier, Sempill, Bligh, and Fleming. The third\r\nline, commanded by Brigadier Mordaunt, consisted of the regiments of\r\nBlackney, Battereau, Pultney, and Howard. On the right wing were placed\r\nCobham\u0027s dragoons, and the half of Kingston\u0027s horse; and on the left\r\nKer\u0027s dragoons, and the other half of Kingston\u0027s horse, with the\r\nCampbells of Argyle. Ten pieces of cannon were placed in the first line,\r\ntwo between each regiment, and six pieces in the second line.\r\n\r\nThe enemy formed at a considerable distance, and marched on in order of\r\nbattle, outlining us both on the right and on the left. About one\r\no\u0027clock the cannonading began; and the Duke\u0027s artillery, being well\r\nserved, could not fail of doing execution. One of the Prince\u0027s grooms,\r\nwho led a sumpter horse, was killed upon the spot; some of the guards\r\nwere wounded, as were several of the horse. One Austin, a very worthy,\r\npleasant fellow, stood on my left; he rode a fine mare, which he was\r\naccustomed to call his lady. He perceived her give a sudden shrink, and,\r\non looking around him, called out, \"Alas! I have lost my lady!\" One of\r\nher hind legs was shot, and hanging by the skin. He that instant\r\ndismounted, and, endeavouring to push her out of the ranks, she came to\r\nthe ground. He took his gun and pistols out of the holsters, stepped\r\nforward, joined the foot, but was never more heard of. The Prince,\r\nobserving this disagreeable position, and without answering any end\r\nwhatever, ordered us down to a covered way, which was a little towards\r\nour right, and where we were less annoyed with the Duke\u0027s cannon; he\r\nhimself, with his aides-de-camp, rode along the line towards the right,\r\nanimating the soldiers. The guards had scarce been a minute or two in\r\nthis position, when the small arms began from the Duke\u0027s army, and kept\r\nup a constant fire; that instant, as it were, one of the aides-de-camp\r\nreturned, and desired us to join the Prince. We met him in endeavouring\r\nto rally the soldiers, who, annoyed with the enemy\u0027s fire, were\r\nbeginning to quit the field. The right of our army, commanded by Lord\r\nGeorge Murray, had made a furious attack, cut their way through Burrel\u0027s\r\nand Monro\u0027s regiments, and had taken possession of two pieces of cannon;\r\nbut a reinforcement of Wolfe\u0027s[104] regiment, etc., coming up from the\r\nDuke\u0027s second line, our right wing was obliged to give way, being at the\r\nsame time flanked with some pieces of artillery, which did great\r\nexecution. Towards the left the attack had been less vigorous than on\r\nthe right, and of course had made but little impression on the Duke\u0027s\r\narmy; nor was it indeed general, for the centre, which had been much\r\ngalled by the enemy\u0027s artillery, almost instantly quitted the field.\r\n\r\nThe scene of confusion was now great; nor can the imagination figure it.\r\nThe men in general were betaking themselves precipitately to flight; nor\r\nwas there any possibility of their being rallied. Horror and dismay was\r\npainted in every countenance. It now became time to provide for the\r\nPrince\u0027s safety: his person had been abundantly exposed. He was got off\r\nthe field, and very narrowly escaped falling in with a body of horse,\r\nwhich had been detached from the Duke\u0027s left, were advancing with an\r\nincredible rapidity, picking up the stragglers, and, as they gave no\r\nquarter, were levelling them with the ground. The greater numbers of the\r\narmy were already out of danger, the flight having been so precipitate.\r\nWe got upon a rising ground, where we turned round and made a general\r\nhalt. The scene was, indeed, tremendous. Never was so total a rout--a\r\nmore thorough discomfiture of an army. The adjacent country was in a\r\nmanner covered with its ruins. The whole was over in about twenty-five\r\nminutes. The Duke\u0027s artillery kept still playing, though not a soul upon\r\nthe field. His army was kept together, all but the horse. The great\r\npursuit was upon the road towards Inverness. Of towards six thousand\r\nmen, which the Prince\u0027s army at this period consisted of, about one\r\nthousand were asleep in Culloden parks, who knew nothing of the action\r\ntill awaked by the noise of the cannon. These in general endeavoured to\r\nsave themselves by taking the road towards Inverness; and most of them\r\nfell a sacrifice to the victors, for this road was in general strewed\r\nwith dead bodies. The Prince at this moment had his cheeks bedewed with\r\ntears; what must not his feeling heart have suffered?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[103] The Jacobite one.\r\n\r\n[104] The hero of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

But seeing no appearance of it, he went to the house of\r\nInvergary and ordered me to remain there to direct such as pass\u0027d that\r\nway the road he took. I remained there two days and announc\u0027d the\r\nPrince\u0027s orders to such as I met, but to no effect, every one taking his\r\nown road.\r\n\r\nI then followed the Prince, who was so far from making a precipitate\r\nretreat [as has been maliciously reported] that he retired by six and\r\nsix miles and arrived the 28th of April O.S. at Knoidart, where I join\u0027d\r\nhim next day and gave him an account of the little or no appearance\r\nthere was of assembling his troops, upon which he wrote circular letters\r\nto all the chieftains, enjoining them, by the obedience they owed him,\r\nto join him immediately with such of their clans as they could gather;\r\nat the same time representing to them the imminent danger they were in\r\nif they neglected it. After remaining some days there in hopes his\r\norders would have been obeyed, and seeing not one person repair to him,\r\nthe extreme danger his person was in, being within seven miles of Lord\r\nLoudon, Sir Alexander MacDonald and the MacLeods, it was proposed to\r\nevade it by retreating to one of the islands near the continent. After\r\nrepeated instances of the like nature he reluctantly assented, leaving\r\nMr. John Hay behind to transmit him the answers of his letters, with an\r\naccount of what should pass, and parted for the Isles in an open fishing\r\nboat at eight at night, attended by Colonel O\u0027Sullivan and me only.\r\nAbout an hour after we parted a violent hurricane arose, which drove us\r\nninety miles[106] from our designed port; and next day running for\r\nshelter into the Island of North Uist,[107] we struck upon a rock and\r\nstaved to pieces, and with great difficulty saved our lives. At our\r\nlanding we were in the most melancholy situation, knowing nobody and\r\nwanting the common necessaries of life. After much search we found a\r\nlittle hut uninhabited, and took shelter there, and with a great deal of\r\npains made a fire to dry our cloaths. Here the Prince remained two days,\r\nhaving no other provisions but a few biskets we had saved out of the\r\nboat, which were entirely spoiled with the salt water.\r\n\r\nAs this island belonged to Sir Alexander MacDonald, and not judging\r\nourselves safe, we determined going elsewhere, and by the greatest good\r\nfortune, one of our boatmen discovered a boat stranded on the coast, and\r\nhaving with great difficulty launched it into the water, we embarked for\r\nthe Harris. In our passage we unfortunately met with another storm which\r\nobliged us to put into an island near Stornoway.... And meeting with\r\nthree ships of war we were constrained to put into a desert island where\r\nwe remained eight days in the greatest misery, having no sustenance but\r\nsome dried fish that Providence threw in our way in this island. When\r\nthe ships disappeared we put to sea again, and next morning met with\r\nanother ship of war just coming out of one of the lochs, who pursued us\r\nfor near an hour; but the wind rising we made our escape. In the\r\nafternoon we arrived at the Island of Benbecula.... Here we remained\r\nsome days longer, till the Duke of Cumberland having intelligence that\r\nthe Prince was concealed in the Long Isle, ordered the militia of the\r\nIsle of Sky and the Independent Companies to go in search of him. As\r\nsoon as we had notice of their landing we retreated to an island about\r\ntwelve miles distance, called Ouya, where we remained till we found they\r\nhad followed us, and then we went for Loch Boisdale, and stayed there\r\neight days, when Captain Carolina Scott landed within a mile of us,\r\nwhich obliged us to separate, the Prince taking me to the mountains, and\r\nO\u0027Sullivan remaining with the boatmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[105] April 16.\r\n\r\n[106] A vast exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[107] Should be Benbecula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM.

Robert Forbes, A.M.,\r\n    Bishop of Ross and Caithness, 1746-1775. Edited from his manuscript,\r\n    with a preface by Henry Paton, M.A. (Edinburgh: Scottish Historical\r\n    Society, 1895.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Journal taken from the mouth of MISS FLORA MACDONALD by DR. BURTON of\r\nYork, when in Edinburgh._\r\n\r\nMiss MacDonald had gone from Sky to Milton in South Uist in order to\r\nvisit her brother-german, who had about that time taken up house. She\r\nhad not been long there till Captain O\u0027Neil (by some lucky accident or\r\nother) had become acquainted with her. When the Prince was surrounded\r\nwith difficulties on all hands, and knew not well what to do for his\r\nfuture safety, Captain O\u0027Neil brought Miss MacDonald to the place where\r\nthe Prince was, and there they concerted the plan. At that time Miss\r\nreturned to Milton. After Miss MacDonald had (with some difficulty)\r\nagreed to undertake the dangerous enterprize, she set out for\r\nClanranald\u0027s house, Saturday, June 21st, and at one of the fords was\r\ntaken prisoner by a party of militia, she not having a passport. She\r\ndemanded to whom they belonged? And finding by the answer that her\r\nstep-father was then commander, she refused to give any answers till she\r\nshould see their captain. So she and her servant, Neil MacKechan, were\r\nprisoners all that night.\r\n\r\nHer stepfather, coming next day, being Sunday, she told him what she was\r\nabout, upon which he granted a passport for herself, a manservant (Neil\r\nMacKechan), and another woman, Bettie Burk, a good spinster, and whom he\r\nrecommended as such in a letter to his wife at Armadale in Sky, as she\r\nhad much lint to spin. If her stepfather (Hugh MacDonald of Armadale)\r\nhad not granted Miss a passport, she could not have undertaken her\r\njourney and voyage. Armadale set his stepdaughter at liberty, who\r\nimmediately made the best of her way to Clanranald\u0027s house and\r\nacquainted the Lady Clanranald with the scheme, who supplied the Prince\r\nwith apparel sufficient for his disguise, viz. a flower\u0027d linen gown, a\r\nwhite apron, etc., and sent some provisions along with him.\r\n\r\nDuring Miss MacDonald\u0027s stay at Clanranald\u0027s house, which was till the\r\nFriday, June 27th, O\u0027Neil went several times betwixt the Prince and\r\nMiss, in which interval another scheme was proposed, that the Prince\r\nshould go under the care of a gentleman to the north ward, but that\r\nfailing them, they behoved to have recourse to that agreed upon before;\r\nand accordingly Lady Clanranald, one Mrs. MacDonald, O\u0027Neil, Miss Flora\r\nMacDonald, and her servant, Neil MacKechan, went to the place where the\r\nPrince was, being about eight Scotch miles. He was then in a very little\r\nhouse or hut, assisting in the roasting of his dinner, which consisted\r\nof the heart, liver, kidneys, etc., of a bullock or sheep, upon a wooden\r\nspit. O\u0027Neil introduced his young preserver and the company, and she sat\r\non the Prince\u0027s right hand and Lady Clanranald on his left. Here all\r\ndined very heartily....\r\n\r\nWhen all were gone who were not to accompany the Prince in his voyage to\r\nthe Isle of Sky, Miss MacDonald desired him to dress himself in his new\r\nattire, which was soon done, and at a proper time they removed their\r\nquarters and went near the water with their boat afloat, nigh at hand\r\nfor readiness to embark in case of an alarm from the shore. Here they\r\narrived, very wet and wearied, and made a fire upon a rock to keep them\r\nsomewhat warm till night. They were soon greatly alarmed by seeing four\r\nwherries full of armed men making towards shore, which made them\r\nextinguish their fire quickly, and to conceal themselves among the\r\nheath....\r\n\r\nAt eight o\u0027clock, June 28th, Saturday, 1746, the Prince, Miss Flora\r\nMacDonald, Neil MacKechan, etc., set sail in a very clear evening from\r\nBenbecula to the Isle of Sky. It is worth observing here that Benbecula\r\nis commonly reckoned a part of South Uist, they being divided from one\r\nanother by the sea only at high water, which then makes a short ferry\r\nbetwixt the two; but at low water people walk over upon the sand from\r\nthe one to the other.\r\n\r\nThey had not rowed from the shore above a league till the sea became\r\nrough, and at last tempestuous, and to entertain the company the Prince\r\nsung several songs and seemed to be in good spirits.\r\n\r\nIn the passage Miss MacDonald fell asleep, and then the Prince carefully\r\nguarded her, lest in the darkness any of the men should chance to step\r\nupon her. She awaked in a surprise with some little bustle in the boat,\r\nand wondered what was the matter, etc....\r\n\r\nFrom hence they rowed on and landed at Kilbride, in Troternish, in the\r\nIsle of Sky, about twelve miles north from the above-mentioned point.\r\nThere were also several parties of militia in the neighbourhood of\r\nKilbride. Miss left the Prince in the boat and went with her servant,\r\nNeil MacKechan, to Mougstot, Sir Alexander MacDonald\u0027s house, and\r\ndesired one of the servants to let Lady Margaret MacDonald know she was\r\ncome to see her ladyship in her way to her mother\u0027s house. Lady Margaret\r\nknew her errand well enough by one Mrs. MacDonald, who had gone a little\r\nbefore to apprize her of it.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Alexander MacDonald of Kingsburgh was accidentally there, Lady\r\nMargaret desired him to conduct the Prince to his house; for it is to be\r\nremarked that Lady Margaret did not see the Prince in any shape.\r\nKingsburgh sent a boy down to the boat with instructions whither to\r\nconduct the Prince about a mile, and he (Kingsburgh) would be there\r\nready to conduct him. Then Kingsburgh took some wine, etc., to refresh\r\nthe Prince with, and set forwards for the place of rendezvous, leaving\r\nMiss MacDonald with Lady Margaret at Mougstot, where the commanding\r\nofficer of the parties in search of the Prince was, and who asked Miss\r\nwhence she came, whither she was going, what news? etc., all which Miss\r\nanswered as she thought most proper, and so as to prevent any discovery\r\nof what she had been engaged in.\r\n\r\nLady MacDonald pressed Miss very much in presence of the officer to\r\nstay, telling her that she had promised to make some stay the first time\r\nshe should happen to come there. But Miss desired to be excused at that\r\ntime, because she wanted to see her mother, and to be at home in these\r\ntroublesome times. Lady Margaret at last let her go, and she and Mrs.\r\nMacDonald above mentioned set forwards with Neil MacKechan and said Mrs.\r\nMacDonald\u0027s maid and her man-servant. They overtook the Prince and\r\nKingsburgh. Mrs. MacDonald was very desirous to see the Prince\u0027s\r\ncountenance; but as he went along he always turned away his face from\r\nMrs. MacDonald to the opposite side whenever he perceived her\r\nendeavouring to stare him in the countenance. But yet she got several\r\nopportunities of seeing his face, though in disguise, which the maid\r\ncould not help taking notice of, and said she had never seen such an\r\nimpudent-looked woman, and durst say she was either an Irish woman or\r\nelse a man in a woman\u0027s dress. Miss MacDonald replied she was an Irish\r\nwoman, for she had seen her before. The maid also took notice of the\r\nPrince\u0027s awkward way of managing the petticoats, and what long strides\r\nhe took in walking along, etc., which obliged Miss MacDonald to desire\r\nMrs. MacDonald (they being both on horseback), to step a little faster\r\nand leave those on foot, because, as there were many parties of militia\r\nin the great roads, it was necessary for the Prince to cross the\r\ncountry, and it was not proper to let Mrs. MacDonald\u0027s man or maid\r\nservant see it. So on they went, and the Prince and Kingsburgh went over\r\nthe hills and travelled south-south-east till they arrived at\r\nKingsburgh\u0027s house, which was about twelve o\u0027clock at night, and they\r\nwere very wet....\r\n\r\nThe day was far advanced before he[108] set out, and when he arrived at\r\na wood side (as the affair had been concerted), not far from\r\nKingsburgh, he changed his apparel once more and put on the Highland\r\ndress Kingsburgh had furnished him with. Then Kingsburgh sent a guide\r\nwith him to Portree, thro\u0027 all byways, while Miss MacDonald went thither\r\non horseback by another road, thereby the better to gain intelligence\r\nand at the same time to prevent a discovery. They were very wet, it\r\nhaving rained very much. Here he only dried his clothes, took some\r\nlittle refreshment, and staid about two hours.\r\n\r\nHither Kingsburgh had sent to prepare a boat, and to have it ready to\r\nconvey the Prince to the place where he wanted to be at, not allowing\r\nthe people about Portree in the meantime to know anything about the\r\nperson\u0027s being the Prince whom they were to receive and to take care of.\r\nYoung MacLeod of Raaza came with Malcolm MacLeod to conduct the Prince\r\nover to the Island of Raaza. The Prince was very uneasy he had not a\r\nMacDonald to conduct him still. He left Portree on Tuesday, the 1st of\r\nJuly, and landed that very same day at a place called Glam in Raaza.\r\n\r\nMiss MacDonald took leave of the Prince at Portree, and from thence went\r\nto her mother, after a fatiguing journey cross the country. She never\r\ntold her mother, or indeed anybody else, what she had done.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[108] The Prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. CHARLES AT CLUNY\u0027S \"CAGE\" (SEPTEMBER, 1746).\r\n\r\n    +Source.+--_The History of the Rebellion in the year 1745_, Appendix\r\n    No. xlvi., p. 377, by John Home, Esq. (London: 1802.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cluny\u0027s account of Locheil and himself after the Battle of Culloden: of\r\ntheir meeting with Charles; and the extraordinary habitation called the\r\nCage, where Charles lived with them, till he received notice that two\r\nFrench frigates were arrived at Lochnanuagh._\r\n\r\nAfter the fatal catastrophe of the Highland army at Culloden, upon the\r\n16th of April, 1746, they meant to make head again about Cluchnicarry,\r\ntill, upon Lord Loudon\u0027s approach with an army, the few that had got\r\ntogether were made to disperse. Locheil being then bad of his wounds,\r\nwas obliged to shift from his own country to the Braes of Rannoch, near\r\nwhich, about the 20th of June, in a hill called Benouchk, Cluny\r\nMacpherson met him, and Sir Stuart Threipland, physician, who attended\r\nhim for the cure of his wounds. Cluny brought them from thence to\r\nBenalder, a hill of great circumference in that part of Badenoch next to\r\nRannoch, and his own ordinary grassings;[109] where they remained\r\ntogether, without ever getting any certain notice of what had become of\r\nthe Prince for near three months, when they received the agreeable news\r\nof his being safe at Locharkaik....\r\n\r\nThe Prince lay the first night at Corineuir, after his coming to\r\nBadenoch, from which he was conducted next day to Mellanauir, a shealing\r\nof very narrow compass, where Locheil, with Macpherson of Breakachie,\r\nAllan Cameron, his principal servant, and two servants of Cluny were at\r\nthe time. It cannot but be remarked, that, when Locheil saw five men\r\napproaching under arms, being the Prince, Lochgary, Dr. Cameron, and two\r\nservants, taking the five men to be of the army or militia, which lay\r\nencamped not above four or five miles from them, and were probably in\r\nsearch of them; as it was in vain to think of flying, Locheil at the\r\ntime being quite lame, and not in any condition to travel, much less to\r\nrun away; it was resolved that the enemy, as they judged them to be,\r\nshould be received with a general discharge of all the arms; in number\r\ntwelve firelocks and some pistols.... But the auspicious hand of\r\nAlmighty God ... prevented those within from firing at the Prince with\r\nhis four attendants; for they came at last so near that they were known\r\nby those within.... Locheil then ushered him into his habitation, which\r\nwas indeed but a very poor one. The Prince was gay, and in better\r\nspirits than it was possible to think he could have been, considering\r\nthe many disasters, disappointments, fatigues and difficulties, he had\r\nundergone. His Royal Highness, with his retinue, went into the hut; and\r\nthere was more meat and drink provided for him than he expected. There\r\nwas plenty of mutton, an anker of whisky, containing twenty Scots pints,\r\nsome good beef sausages made the year before, with plenty of butter and\r\ncheese, besides a large well cured bacon ham. Upon his entry, the Prince\r\ntook a hearty dram, which he sometimes called for thereafter, to drink\r\nthe healths of his friends. When some minced collops were dressed with\r\nbutter, in a large sauce-pan, which Locheil and Cluny always carried\r\nabout with them, being the only fire vessel they had, His Royal Highness\r\neat heartily, and said with a very cheerful countenance: \"Now,\r\ngentlemen, I live like a Prince:\" though at the same time he was no\r\notherwise entertained than eating his collops out of the pan, with a\r\nsilver spoon....\r\n\r\nThe day after Clunie arrived, he thought it time to remove from\r\nMellanauir, and took the Prince about two miles further into Benalder,\r\nto a little sheil called Uiskchibra, where the hut or bothie was\r\nsuperlatively bad and smoky; yet His Royal Highness put up with\r\neverything. Here he remained for two or three nights; and then removed\r\nto a very romantic habitation, made for him by Clunie, two miles further\r\ninto Benalder, called the Cage; which was a great curiosity, and can\r\nscarcely be described to perfection. It was situated in the face of a\r\nvery rough, high and rocky mountain, called Letternilichk, still a part\r\nof Benalder, full of great stones and crevices, and some scattered wood\r\ninterspersed. The habitation called the Cage, in the face of that\r\nmountain, was within a small thick bush of wood. There were first some\r\nrows of trees laid down, in order to level a floor for the habitation;\r\nand as the place was steep, this raised the lower side to an equal\r\nheight with the other; and these trees, in the way of joists or planks,\r\nwere levelled with earth and gravel. There were betwixt the trees,\r\ngrowing naturally on their own roots, some stakes fixed in the earth,\r\nwhich, with the trees, were interwoven with ropes, made of heath and\r\nbirch twigs, up to the top of the Cage, it being of a round or rather\r\noval shape; and the whole thatched and covered over with fog.[110] This\r\nwhole fabric hung, as it were, by a large tree, which reclined from the\r\none end, all along the roof to the other, and which gave it the name of\r\nthe Cage, and by chance there happened to be two stones at a small\r\ndistance from one another, in the side next the precipice, resembling\r\nthe pillars of a chimney where the fire was placed. The smoke had its\r\nvent out here, all along the face of the rock, which was so much of the\r\nsame colour, that one could discover no difference in the clearest day.\r\nThe Cage was no larger than to contain six or seven persons; four of\r\nwhom were frequently employed playing at cards, one idle looking on, one\r\nbaking, and another firing bread and cooking. Here His Royal Highness\r\nremained till the 13th of September, when he was informed that the\r\nvessels for receiving and carrying him to France were arrived at\r\nLochnanuagh. The Prince set out immediately; and travelling only by\r\nnight, arrived at Borodale, near Lochnanuagh, on the 19th of September,\r\nand embarked there on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[109] Grazings.\r\n\r\n[110] Moss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBILLING AND SONS, LTD., PRINTERS, GUILDFORD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo. 1s. net each_\r\n\r\n+Bell\u0027s English History Source-Books+\r\n\r\nJOINT EDITORS\r\n\r\n S.
