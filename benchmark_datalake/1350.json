It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.",

  "content": "THE COUNTRY DOCTOR ***\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY DOCTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Honoré De Balzac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated by Ellen Marriage and Clara Bell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             “For a wounded heart--shadow and silence.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            To my Mother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn hardly any of his books, with the possible exception of _Eugénie\r\nGrandet_, does Balzac seem to have taken a greater interest than in _Le\r\nMédecin de Campagne_; and the fact of this interest, together with the\r\nmerit and intensity of the book in each case, is, let it be repeated, a\r\nvalid argument against those who would have it that there was something\r\nessentially sinister both in his genius and his character.\r\n\r\n_Le Médecin de Campagne_ was an early book; it was published in 1833, a\r\ndate of which there is an interesting mark in the selection of the name\r\n“Evelina,” the name of Madame Hanska, whom Balzac had just met, for the\r\nlost Jansenist love of Benassis; and it had been on the stocks for\r\na considerable time. It is also noteworthy, as lying almost entirely\r\noutside the general scheme of the _Comedie Humaine_ as far as\r\npersonages go. Its chief characters in the remarkable, if not absolutely\r\nimpeccable, _répertoire_ of MM. Cerfberr and Christophe (they have,\r\na rare thing with them, missed Agathe the forsaken mistress) have no\r\nreferences appended to their articles, except to the book itself; and\r\nI cannot remember that any of the more generally pervading _dramatis\r\npersonæ_ of the Comedy makes even an incidental appearance here. The\r\nbook is as isolated as its scene and subject--I might have added, as\r\nits own beauty, which is singular and unique, nor wholly easy to give a\r\ncritical account of. The transformation of the _cretin_-haunted desert\r\ninto a happy valley is in itself a commonplace of the preceding century;\r\nit may be found several times over in Marmontel’s _Contes Moraux_, as\r\nwell as in other places. The extreme minuteness of detail, effective\r\nas it is in the picture of the house and elsewhere, becomes a little\r\ntedious even for well-tried and well-affected readers, in reference to\r\nthe exact number of cartwrights and harness-makers, and so forth; while\r\nthe modern reader pure and simple, though schooled to endure detail,\r\nis schooled to endure it only of the ugly. The minor characters and\r\nepisodes, with the exception of the wonderful story or legend of\r\nNapoleon by Private Goguelat, and the private himself, are neither of\r\nthe first interest, nor always carefully worked out: La Fosseuse, for\r\ninstance, is a very tantalizingly unfinished study, of which it is\r\nnearly certain that Balzac must at some time or other have meant to make\r\nmuch more than he has made; Genestas, excellent as far as he goes, is\r\nnot much more than a type; and there is nobody else in the foreground at\r\nall except the Doctor himself.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, beyond all doubt in the very subordination of these\r\nother characters to Benassis, and in the skilful grouping of the whole\r\nas background and adjunct to him, that the appeal of the book as art\r\nconsists. From that point of view there are grounds for regarding it as\r\nthe finest of the author’s work in the simple style, the least indebted\r\nto super-added ornament or to mere variety. The dangerous expedient of\r\na _recit_, of which the eighteenth-century novelists were so fond, has\r\nnever been employed with more successful effect than in the confession\r\nof Benassis, at once the climax and the centre of the story. And\r\none thing which strikes us immediately about this confession is the\r\nuniversality of its humanity and its strange freedom from merely\r\nnational limitations. To very few French novelists--to few even of those\r\nwho are generally credited with a much softer mould and a much purer\r\nmorality than Balzac is popularly supposed to have been able to\r\nboast--would inconstancy to a mistress have seemed a fault which could\r\nbe reasonably punished, which could be even reasonably represented as\r\nhaving been punished in fact, by the refusal of an honest girl’s love in\r\nthe first place. Nor would many have conceived as possible, or have\r\nbeen able to represent in lifelike colors, the lifelong penance which\r\nBenassis imposes on himself. The tragic end, indeed, is more in their\r\ngeneral way, but they would seldom have known how to lead up to it.\r\n\r\nIn almost all ways Balzac has saved himself from the dangers incident\r\nto his plan in this book after a rather miraculous fashion. The Goguelat\r\nmyth may seem disconnected, and he did as a matter of fact once publish\r\nit separately; yet it sets off (in the same sort of felicitous manner of\r\nwhich Shakespeare’s clown-scenes and others are the capital examples\r\nin literature) both the slightly matter-of-fact details of the\r\nbeatification of the valley and the various minute sketches of places\r\nand folk, and the almost superhuman goodness of Benassis, and his\r\nintensely and piteously human suffering and remorse. It is like the red\r\ncloak in a group; it lights, warms, inspirits the whole picture.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the most remarkable thing of all is the way in which Balzac\r\nin this story, so full of goodness of feeling, of true religion (for if\r\nBenassis is not an ostensible practiser of religious rites, he avows his\r\northodoxy in theory, and more than justifies it in practice), has almost\r\nentirely escaped the sentimentality _plus_ unorthodoxy of similar work\r\nin the eighteenth century, and the sentimentality _plus_ orthodoxy of\r\nsimilar work in the nineteenth. Benassis no doubt plays Providence in\r\na manner and with a success which it is rarely given to mortal man to\r\nachieve; but we do not feel either the approach to sham, or the more\r\nthan approach to gush, with which similar handling on the part of\r\nDickens too often affects some of us. The sin and the punishment of the\r\nDoctor, the thoroughly human figures of Genestas and the rest, save the\r\nsituation from this and other drawbacks. We are not in the Cockaigne of\r\nperfectibility, where Marmontel and Godwin disport themselves; we are in\r\na very practical place, where time-bargains in barley are made, and\r\nyou pay the respectable, if not lavish board of ten francs per day for\r\nentertainment to man and beast.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, explain as we will, there will always remain something\r\ninexplicable in the appeal of such a book as the _Médecin de Campagne_.\r\nThis helps, and that, and the other; we can see what change might have\r\ndamaged the effect, and what have endangered it altogether. We must, of\r\ncourse, acknowledge that as it is there are _longueurs_, intrusion of\r\nSaint Simonian jargon, passages of _galimatias_, and of preaching.\r\nBut of what in strictness produces the good effect we can only say one\r\nthing, and that is, it was the genius of Balzac working as it listed and\r\nas it knew how to work.\r\n\r\nThe book was originally published by Mme. Delaunay in September 1833\r\nin two volumes and thirty-six chapters with headings. Next year it was\r\nrepublished in four volumes by Werdet, and the last fifteen chapters\r\nwere thrown together into four. In 1836 it reappeared with dedication\r\nand date, but with the divisions further reduced to seven; being those\r\nwhich here appear, with the addition of two, “La Fosseuse” and “Propos\r\nde Braves Gens” between “A Travers Champs” and “Le Napoleon du Peuple.”\r\n These two were removed in 1839, when it was published in a single volume\r\nby Charpentier. In all these issues the book was independent. It became\r\na “Scene de la Vie de Campagne” in 1846, and was then admitted into the\r\n_Comedie_. The separate issues of Goguelat’s story referred to above\r\nmade their appearances first in _L’Europe Litteraire_ for June 19,\r\n1833 (_before_ the book form), and then with the imprint of a sort of\r\nsyndicate of publishers in 1842.\r\n\r\n                                                   George Saintsbury\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. THE COUNTRYSIDE AND THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a lovely spring morning in the year 1829, a man of fifty or\r\nthereabouts was wending his way on horseback along the mountain road\r\nthat leads to a large village near the Grande Chartreuse. This village\r\nis the market town of a populous canton that lies within the limits of a\r\nvalley of some considerable length. The melting of the snows had filled\r\nthe boulder-strewn bed of the torrent (often dry) that flows through\r\nthis valley, which is closely shut in between two parallel mountain\r\nbarriers, above which the peaks of Savoy and of Dauphine tower on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAll the scenery of the country that lies between the chain of the two\r\nMauriennes is very much alike; yet here in the district through which\r\nthe stranger was traveling there are soft undulations of the land, and\r\nvarying effects of light which might be sought for elsewhere in\r\nvain. Sometimes the valley, suddenly widening, spreads out a soft\r\nirregularly-shaped carpet of grass before the eyes; a meadow constantly\r\nwatered by the mountain streams that keep it fresh and green at all\r\nseasons of the year. Sometimes a roughly-built sawmill appears in a\r\npicturesque position, with its stacks of long pine trunks with the bark\r\npeeled off, and its mill stream, brought from the bed of the torrent in\r\ngreat square wooden pipes, with masses of dripping filament issuing\r\nfrom every crack. Little cottages, scattered here and there, with their\r\ngardens full of blossoming fruit trees, call up the ideas that are\r\naroused by the sight of industrious poverty; while the thought of ease,\r\nsecured after long years of toil, is suggested by some larger houses\r\nfarther on, with their red roofs of flat round tiles, shaped like the\r\nscales of a fish. There is no door, moreover, that does not duly exhibit\r\na basket in which the cheeses are hung up to dry. Every roadside and\r\nevery croft is adorned with vines; which here, as in Italy, they train\r\nto grow about dwarf elm trees, whose leaves are stripped off to feed the\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nNature, in her caprice, has brought the sloping hills on either side\r\nso near together in some places, that there is no room for fields, or\r\nbuildings, or peasants’ huts. Nothing lies between them but the torrent,\r\nroaring over its waterfalls between two lofty walls of granite that rise\r\nabove it, their sides covered with the leafage of tall beeches and\r\ndark fir trees to the height of a hundred feet. The trees, with their\r\ndifferent kinds of foliage, rise up straight and tall, fantastically\r\ncolored by patches of lichen, forming magnificent colonnades, with a\r\nline of straggling hedgerow of guelder rose, briar rose, box and arbutus\r\nabove and below the roadway at their feet. The subtle perfume of this\r\nundergrowth was mingled just then with scents from the wild mountain\r\nregion and with the aromatic fragrance of young larch shoots, budding\r\npoplars, and resinous pines.\r\n\r\nHere and there a wreath of mist about the heights sometimes hid and\r\nsometimes gave glimpses of the gray crags, that seemed as dim and vague\r\nas the soft flecks of cloud dispersed among them. The whole face of the\r\ncountry changed every moment with the changing light in the sky; the\r\nhues of the mountains, the soft shades of their lower slopes, the very\r\nshape of the valleys seemed to vary continually. A ray of sunlight\r\nthrough the tree-stems, a clear space made by nature in the woods, or a\r\nlandslip here and there, coming as a surprise to make a contrast in the\r\nforeground, made up an endless series of pictures delightful to see amid\r\nthe silence, at the time of year when all things grow young, and when\r\nthe sun fills a cloudless heaven with a blaze of light. In short, it was\r\na fair land--it was the land of France!\r\n\r\nThe traveler was a tall man, dressed from head to foot in a suit of blue\r\ncloth, which must have been brushed just as carefully every morning\r\nas the glossy coat of his horse. He held himself firm and erect in the\r\nsaddle like an old cavalry officer. Even if his black cravat and doeskin\r\ngloves, the pistols that filled his holsters, and the valise securely\r\nfastened to the crupper behind him had not combined to mark him out as a\r\nsoldier, the air of unconcern that sat on his face, his regular features\r\n(scarred though they were with the smallpox), his determined manner,\r\nself-reliant expression, and the way he held his head, all revealed\r\nthe habits acquired through military discipline, of which a soldier can\r\nnever quite divest himself, even after he has retired from service into\r\nprivate life.\r\n\r\nAny other traveler would have been filled with wonder at the loveliness\r\nof this Alpine region, which grows so bright and smiling as it becomes\r\nmerged in the great valley systems of southern France; but the officer,\r\nwho no doubt had previously traversed a country across which the French\r\narmies had been drafted in the course of Napoleon’s wars, enjoyed the\r\nview before him without appearing to be surprised by the many changes\r\nthat swept across it. It would seem that Napoleon has extinguished in\r\nhis soldiers the sensation of wonder; for an impassive face is a sure\r\ntoken by which you may know the men who served erewhile under the\r\nshort-lived yet deathless Eagles of the great Emperor. The traveler was,\r\nin fact, one of those soldiers (seldom met with nowadays) whom shot\r\nand shell have respected, although they have borne their part on every\r\nbattlefield where Napoleon commanded.\r\n\r\nThere had been nothing unusual in his life. He had fought valiantly in\r\nthe ranks as a simple and loyal soldier, doing his duty as faithfully\r\nby night as by day, and whether in or out of his officer’s sight. He had\r\nnever dealt a sabre stroke in vain, and was incapable of giving one\r\ntoo many. If he wore at his buttonhole the rosette of an officer of the\r\nLegion of Honor, it was because the unanimous voice of his regiment had\r\nsingled him out as the man who best deserved to receive it after the\r\nbattle of Borodino.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures,\r\nwho are always at peace with themselves, and who are conscious of a\r\nfeeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request, no\r\nmatter what its nature may be. So promotion had come to him tardily, and\r\nby virtue of the slowly-working laws of seniority. He had been made\r\na sub-lieutenant in 1802, but it was not until 1829 that he became a\r\nmajor, in spite of the grayness of his moustaches. His life had been so\r\nblameless that no man in the army, not even the general himself, could\r\napproach him without an involuntary feeling of respect. It is possible\r\nthat he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who\r\nranked above him; but, on the other hand, there was not one of his men\r\nthat did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a\r\ngood mother. For them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe. He\r\nhimself had also once served in the ranks, and knew the sorry joys and\r\ngaily-endured hardships of the soldier’s lot. He knew the errors that\r\nmay be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men--“his\r\nchildren,” as he always called them--and when on campaign he readily\r\ngave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the\r\nwealthier classes.\r\n\r\nHis own personal history lay buried beneath the deepest reserve. Like\r\nalmost every military man in Europe, he had only seen the world through\r\ncannon smoke, or in the brief intervals of peace that occurred so seldom\r\nduring the Emperor’s continual wars with the rest of Europe. Had he\r\nor had he not thought of marriage? The question remained unsettled.\r\nAlthough no one doubted that Commandant Genestas had made conquests\r\nduring his sojourn in town after town and country after country where\r\nhe had taken part in the festivities given and received by the officers,\r\nyet no one knew this for a certainty. There was no prudery about him;\r\nhe would not decline to join a pleasure party; he in no way offended\r\nagainst military standards; but when questioned as to his affairs of\r\nthe heart, he either kept silence or answered with a jest. To the words,\r\n“How are you, commandant?” addressed to him by an officer over the wine,\r\nhis reply was, “Pass the bottle, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nM. Pierre Joseph Genestas was an unostentatious kind of Bayard. There\r\nwas nothing romantic nor picturesque about him--he was too thoroughly\r\ncommonplace. His ways of living were those of a well-to-do man. Although\r\nhe had nothing beside his pay, and his pension was all that he had to\r\nlook to in the future, the major always kept two years’ pay untouched,\r\nand never spent his allowances, like some shrewd old men of business\r\nwith whom cautious prudence has almost become a mania. He was so little\r\nof a gambler that if, when in company, some one was wanted to cut in\r\nor to take a bet at ecarte, he usually fixed his eyes on his boots; but\r\nthough he did not allow himself any extravagances, he conformed in every\r\nway to custom.\r\n\r\nHis uniforms lasted longer than those of any other officer in his\r\nregiment, as a consequence of the sedulously careful habits that\r\nsomewhat straitened means had so instilled into him, that they had come\r\nto be like a second nature. Perhaps he might have been suspected\r\nof meannesss if it had not been for the fact that with wonderful\r\ndisinterestedness and all a comrade’s readiness, his purse would be\r\nopened for some harebrained boy who had ruined himself at cards or by\r\nsome other folly. He did a service of this kind with such thoughtful\r\ntact, that it seemed as though he himself had at one time lost heavy\r\nsums at play; he never considered that he had any right to control the\r\nactions of his debtor; he never made mention of the loan. He was the\r\nchild of his company; he was alone in the world, so he had adopted the\r\narmy for his fatherland, and the regiment for his family. Very rarely,\r\ntherefore, did any one seek the motives underlying his praiseworthy turn\r\nfor thrift; for it pleased others, for the most part, to set it down to\r\na not unnatural wish to increase the amount of the savings that were\r\nto render his old age comfortable. Till the eve of his promotion to the\r\nrank of lieutenant-colonel of cavalry it was fair to suppose that it was\r\nhis ambition to retire in the course of some campaign with a colonel’s\r\nepaulettes and pension.\r\n\r\nIf Genestas’ name came up when the officers gossiped after drill,\r\nthey were wont to classify him among the men who begin with taking the\r\ngood-conduct prize at school, and who, throughout the term of\r\ntheir natural lives, continue to be punctilious, conscientious, and\r\npassionless--as good as white bread, and just as insipid. Thoughtful\r\nminds, however, regarded him very differently. Not seldom it would\r\nhappen that a glance, or an expression as full of significance as the\r\nutterance of a savage, would drop from him and bear witness to past\r\nstorms in his soul; and a careful study of his placid brow revealed a\r\npower of stifling down and repressing his passions into inner depths,\r\nthat had been dearly bought by a lengthy acquaintance with the perils\r\nand disastrous hazards of war. An officer who had only just joined the\r\nregiment, the son of a peer of France, had said one day of Genestas,\r\nthat he would have made one of the most conscientious of priests, or the\r\nmost upright of tradesmen.\r\n\r\n“Add, the least of a courtier among marquises,” put in Genestas,\r\nscanning the young puppy, who did not know that his commandant could\r\noverhear him.\r\n\r\nThere was a burst of laughter at the words, for the lieutenant’s father\r\ncringed to all the powers that be; he was a man of supple intellect,\r\naccustomed to jump with every change of government, and his son took\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nMen like Genestas are met with now and again in the French army; natures\r\nthat show themselves to be wholly great at need, and relapse into their\r\nordinary simplicity when the action is over; men that are little mindful\r\nof fame and reputation, and utterly forgetful of danger. Perhaps there\r\nare many more of them than the shortcomings of our own characters\r\nwill allow us to imagine. Yet, for all that, any one who believed that\r\nGenestas was perfect would be strangely deceiving himself. The major was\r\nsuspicious, given to violent outbursts of anger, and apt to be tiresome\r\nin argument; he was full of national prejudices, and above all things,\r\nwould insist that he was in the right, when he was, as a matter of fact,\r\nin the wrong. He retained the liking for good wine that he had acquired\r\nin the ranks. If he rose from a banquet with all the gravity befitting\r\nhis position, he seemed serious and pensive, and had no mind at such\r\ntimes to admit any one into his confidence.\r\n\r\nFinally, although he was sufficiently acquainted with the customs\r\nof society and with the laws of politeness, to which he conformed as\r\nrigidly as if they had been military regulations; though he had real\r\nmental power, both natural and acquired; and although he had mastered\r\nthe art of handling men, the science of tactics, the theory of sabre\r\nplay, and the mysteries of the farrier’s craft, his learning had been\r\nprodigiously neglected. He knew in a hazy kind of way that Caesar was a\r\nRoman Consul, or an Emperor, and that Alexander was either a Greek or\r\na Macedonian; he would have conceded either quality or origin in both\r\ncases without discussion. If the conversation turned on science or\r\nhistory, he was wont to become thoughtful, and to confine his share in\r\nit to little approving nods, like a man who by dint of profound thought\r\nhas arrived at scepticism.\r\n\r\nWhen, at Schonbrunn, on May 13, 1809, Napoleon wrote the bulletin\r\naddressed to the Grand Army, then the masters of Vienna, in which he\r\nsaid that _like Medea, the Austrian princes had slain their children\r\nwith their own hands_; Genestas, who had been recently made a captain,\r\ndid not wish to compromise his newly conferred dignity by asking who\r\nMedea was; he relied upon Napoleon’s character, and felt quite sure that\r\nthe Emperor was incapable of making any announcement not in proper form\r\nto the Grand Army and the House of Austria. So he thought that Medea\r\nwas some archduchess whose conduct was open to criticism. Still, as the\r\nmatter might have some bearing on the art of war, he felt uneasy about\r\nthe Medea of the bulletin until a day arrived when Mlle. Raucourt\r\nrevived the tragedy of Medea. The captain saw the placard, and did\r\nnot fail to repair to the Theatre Francais that evening, to see the\r\ncelebrated actress in her mythological role, concerning which he gained\r\nsome information from his neighbors.\r\n\r\nA man, however, who as a private soldier had possessed sufficient\r\nforce of character to learn to read, write, and cipher, could clearly\r\nunderstand that as a captain he ought to continue his education. So from\r\nthis time forth he read new books and romances with avidity, in this way\r\ngaining a half-knowledge, of which he made a very fair use. He went\r\nso far in his gratitude to his teachers as to undertake the defence of\r\nPigault-Lebrun, remarking that in his opinion he was instructive and not\r\nseldom profound.\r\n\r\nThis officer, whose acquired practical wisdom did not allow him to make\r\nany journey in vain, had just come from Grenoble, and was on his way to\r\nthe Grande Chartreuse, after obtaining on the previous evening a week’s\r\nleave of absence from his colonel. He had not expected that the journey\r\nwould be a long one; but when, league after league, he had been misled\r\nas to the distance by the lying statements of the peasants, he thought\r\nit would be prudent not to venture any farther without fortifying the\r\ninner man. Small as were his chances of finding any housewife in her\r\ndwelling at a time when every one was hard at work in the fields, he\r\nstopped before a little cluster of cottages that stood about a piece of\r\nland common to all of them, more or less describing a square, which was\r\nopen to all comers.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the soil thus held in conjoint ownership was hard and\r\ncarefully swept, but intersected by open drains. Roses, ivy, and tall\r\ngrasses grew over the cracked and disjointed walls. Some rags were\r\ndrying on a miserable currant bush that stood at the entrance of the\r\nsquare. A pig wallowing in a heap of straw was the first inhabitant\r\nencountered by Genestas. At the sound of horse hoofs the creature\r\ngrunted, raised its head, and put a great black cat to flight. A young\r\npeasant girl, who was carrying a bundle of grass on her head, suddenly\r\nappeared, followed at a distance by four little brats, clad in rags, it\r\nis true, but vigorous, sunburned, picturesque, bold-eyed, and riotous;\r\nthorough little imps, looking like angels. The sun shone down with an\r\nindescribable purifying influence upon the air, the wretched cottages,\r\nthe heaps of refuse, and the unkempt little crew.\r\n\r\nThe soldier asked whether it was possible to obtain a cup of milk. All\r\nthe answer the girl made him was a hoarse cry. An old woman suddenly\r\nappeared on the threshold of one of the cabins, and the young peasant\r\ngirl passed on into a cowshed, with a gesture that pointed out the\r\naforesaid old woman, towards whom Genestas went; taking care at the\r\nsame time to keep a tight hold on his horse, lest the children who were\r\nalready running about under his hoofs should be hurt. He repeated his\r\nrequest, with which the housewife flatly refused to comply. She would\r\nnot, she said, disturb the cream on the pans full of milk from\r\nwhich butter was to be made. The officer overcame this objection by\r\nundertaking to repay her amply for the wasted cream, and then tied up\r\nhis horse at the door, and went inside the cottage.\r\n\r\nThe four children belonging to the woman all appeared to be of the same\r\nage--an odd circumstance which struck the commandant. A fifth clung\r\nabout her skirts; a weak, pale, sickly-looking child, who doubtless\r\nneeded more care than the others, and who on that account was the best\r\nbeloved, the Benjamin of the family.\r\n\r\nGenestas seated himself in a corner by the fireless hearth. A sublime\r\nsymbol met his eyes on the high mantel-shelf above him--a colored\r\nplaster cast of the Virgin with the Child Jesus in her arms. Bare earth\r\nmade the flooring of the cottage. It had been beaten level in the first\r\ninstance, but in course of time it had grown rough and uneven, so that\r\nthough it was clean, its ruggedness was not unlike that of the magnified\r\nrind of an orange. A sabot filled with salt, a frying-pan, and a\r\nlarge kettle hung inside the chimney. The farther end of the room was\r\ncompletely filled by a four-post bedstead, with a scalloped valance\r\nfor decoration. The walls were black; there was an opening to admit the\r\nlight above the worm-eaten door; and here and there were a few stools\r\nconsisting of rough blocks of beech-wood, each set upon three wooden\r\nlegs; a hutch for bread, a large wooden dipper, a bucket and some\r\nearthen milk-pans, a spinning-wheel on the top of the bread-hutch, and\r\na few wicker mats for draining cheeses. Such were the ornaments and\r\nhousehold furniture of the wretched dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe officer, who had been absorbed in flicking his riding-whip against\r\nthe floor, presently became a witness to a piece of by-play, all\r\nunsuspicious though he was that any drama was about to unfold itself.\r\nNo sooner had the old woman, followed by her scald-headed Benjamin,\r\ndisappeared through a door that led into her dairy, than the four\r\nchildren, after having stared at the soldier as long as they wished,\r\ndrove away the pig by way of a beginning. This animal, their accustomed\r\nplaymate, having come as far as the threshold, the little brats made\r\nsuch an energetic attack upon him, that he was forced to beat a hasty\r\nretreat. When the enemy had been driven without, the children besieged\r\nthe latch of a door that gave way before their united efforts, and\r\nslipped out of the worn staple that held it; and finally they bolted\r\ninto a kind of fruit-loft, where they very soon fell to munching the\r\ndried plums, to the amusement of the commandant, who watched this\r\nspectacle. The old woman, with the face like parchment and the dirty\r\nragged clothing, came back at this moment, with a jug of milk for her\r\nvisitor in her hand.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you good-for-nothings!” cried she.\r\n\r\nShe ran to the children, clutched an arm of each child, bundled them\r\ninto the room, and carefully closed the door of her storeroom of plenty.\r\nBut she did not take their prunes away from them.\r\n\r\n“Now, then, be good, my pets! If one did not look after them,” she went\r\non, looking at Genestas, “they would eat up the whole lot of prunes, the\r\nmadcaps!”\r\n\r\nThen she seated herself on a three-legged stool, drew the little\r\nweakling between her knees, and began to comb and wash his head with a\r\nwoman’s skill and with motherly assiduity. The four small thieves\r\nhung about. Some of them stood, others leant against the bed or the\r\nbread-hutch. They gnawed their prunes without saying a word, but they\r\nkept their sly and mischievous eyes fixed upon the stranger. In spite\r\nof grimy countenances and noses that stood in need of wiping, they all\r\nlooked strong and healthy.\r\n\r\n“Are they your children?” the soldier asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n“Asking your pardon, sir, they are charity children. They give me three\r\nfrancs a month and a pound’s weight of soap for each of them.”\r\n\r\n“But it must cost you twice as much as that to keep them, good woman?”\r\n\r\n“That is just what M. Benassis tells me, sir; but if other folk will\r\nboard the children for the same money, one has to make it do. Nobody\r\nwants the children, but for all that there is a good deal of performance\r\nto go through before they will let us have them. When the milk we give\r\nthem comes to nothing, they cost us scarcely anything. Besides that,\r\nthree francs is a great deal, sir; there are fifteen francs coming in,\r\nto say nothing of the five pounds’ weight of soap. In our part of the\r\nworld you would simply have to wear your life out before you would make\r\nten sous a day.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have some land of your own?” asked the commandant.\r\n\r\n“No, sir. I had some land once when my husband was alive; since he died\r\nI have done so badly that I had to sell it.”\r\n\r\n“Why, how do you reach the year’s end without debts?” Genestas went on,\r\n“when you bring up children for a livelihood and wash and feed them on\r\ntwo sous a day?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we never go to St. Sylvester’s Day without debt, sir,” she went\r\non without ceasing to comb the child’s hair. “But so it is--Providence\r\nhelps us out. I have a couple of cows. Then my daughter and I do some\r\ngleaning at harvest-time, and in winter we pick up firewood. Then at\r\nnight we spin. Ah! we never want to see another winter like this last\r\none, that is certain! I owe the miller seventy-five francs for flour.\r\nLuckily he is M. Benassis’ miller. M. Benassis, ah! he is a friend to\r\npoor people. He has never asked for his due from anybody, and he will\r\nnot begin with us. Besides, our cow has a calf, and that will set us a\r\nbit straighter.”\r\n\r\nThe four orphans for whom the old woman’s affection represented\r\nall human guardianship had come to an end of their prunes. As their\r\nfoster-mother’s attention was taken up by the officer with whom she was\r\nchatting, they seized the opportunity, and banded themselves together in\r\na compact file, so as to make yet another assault upon the latch of the\r\ndoor that stood between them and the tempting heap of dried plums. They\r\nadvanced to the attack, not like French soldiers, but as stealthily as\r\nGermans, impelled by frank animal greediness.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you little rogues! Do you want to finish them up?”\r\n\r\nThe old woman rose, caught the strongest of the four, administered a\r\ngentle slap on the back, and flung him out of the house. Not a tear did\r\nhe shed, but the others remained breathless with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“They give you a lot of trouble----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, sir, but they can smell the prunes, the little dears. If I were\r\nto leave them alone here for a moment, they would stuff themselves with\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“You are very fond of them?”\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised her head at this, and looked at him with gentle\r\nmalice in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Fond of them!” she said. “I have had to part with three of them\r\nalready. I only have the care of them until they are six years old,” she\r\nwent on with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“But where are your own children?”\r\n\r\n“I have lost them.”\r\n\r\n“How old are you?” Genestas asked, to efface the impression left by his\r\nlast question.\r\n\r\n“I am thirty-eight years old, sir. It will be two years come next St.\r\nJohn’s Day since my husband died.”\r\n\r\nShe finished dressing the poor sickly mite, who seemed to thank her by a\r\nloving look in his faded eyes.\r\n\r\n“What a life of toil and self-denial!” thought the cavalry officer.\r\n\r\nBeneath a roof worthy of the stable wherein Jesus Christ was born,\r\nthe hardest duties of motherhood were fulfilled cheerfully and without\r\nconsciousness of merit. What hearts were these that lay so deeply buried\r\nin neglect and obscurity! What wealth, and what poverty! Soldiers,\r\nbetter than other men, can appreciate the element of grandeur to be\r\nfound in heroism in sabots, in the Evangel clad in rags. The Book may be\r\nfound elsewhere, adorned, embellished, tricked out in silk and satin\r\nand brocade, but here, of a surety, dwelt the spirit of the Book. It was\r\nimpossible to doubt that Heaven had some holy purpose underlying it all,\r\nat the sight of the woman who had taken a mother’s lot upon herself, as\r\nJesus Christ had taken the form of a man, who gleaned and suffered and\r\nran into debt for her little waifs; a woman who defrauded herself in\r\nher reckonings, and would not own that she was ruining herself that she\r\nmight be a Mother. One was constrained to admit, at the sight of her,\r\nthat the good upon earth have something in common with the angels in\r\nheaven; Commandant Genestas shook his head as he looked at her.\r\n\r\n“Is M. Benassis a clever doctor?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“I do not know, sir, but he cures poor people for nothing.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that this is a man and no mistake!” he went on, speaking\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, sir, and a good man too! There is scarcely any one hereabouts\r\nthat does not put his name in their prayers, morning and night!”\r\n\r\n“That is for you, mother,” said the soldier, as he gave her several\r\ncoins, “and that is for the children,” he went on, as he added another\r\ncrown. “Is M. Benassis’ house still a long way off?” he asked, when he\r\nhad mounted his horse.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, sir, a bare league at most.”\r\n\r\nThe commandant set out, fully persuaded that two leagues remained ahead\r\nof him. Yet after all he soon caught a glimpse through the trees of the\r\nlittle town’s first cluster of houses, and then of all the roofs that\r\ncrowded about a conical steeple, whose slates were secured to the angles\r\nof the wooden framework by sheets of tin that glittered in the sun. This\r\nsort of roof, which has a peculiar appearance, denotes the nearness of\r\nthe borders of Savoy, where it is very common. The valley is wide at\r\nthis particular point, and a fair number of houses pleasantly situated,\r\neither in the little plain or along the side of the mountain stream,\r\nlend human interest to the well-tilled spot, a stronghold with no\r\napparent outlet among the mountains that surround it.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when Genestas reined in his horse beneath an avenue of\r\nelm-trees half-way up the hillside, and only a few paces from the town,\r\nto ask the group of children who stood before him for M. Benassis’\r\nhouse. At first the children looked at each other, then they scrutinized\r\nthe stranger with the expression that they usually wear when they set\r\neyes upon anything for the first time; a different curiosity and\r\na different thought in every little face. Then the boldest and the\r\nmerriest of the band, a little bright-eyed urchin, with bare, muddy\r\nfeet, repeated his words over again, in child fashion.\r\n\r\n“M. Benassis’ house, sir?” adding, “I will show you the way there.”\r\n\r\nHe walked along in front of the horse, prompted quite as much by a wish\r\nto gain a kind of importance by being in the stranger’s company, as by\r\na child’s love of being useful, or the imperative craving to be doing\r\nsomething, that possesses mind and body at his age. The officer followed\r\nhim for the entire length of the principal street of the country town.\r\nThe way was paved with cobblestones, and wound in and out among the\r\nhouses, which their owners had erected along its course in the most\r\narbitrary fashion. In one place a bake-house had been built out into\r\nthe middle of the roadway; in another a gable protruded, partially\r\nobstructing the passage, and yet farther on a mountain stream flowed\r\nacross it in a runnel. Genestas noticed a fair number of roofs of tarred\r\nshingle, but yet more of them were thatched; a few were tiled, and\r\nsome seven or eight (belonging no doubt to the cure, the justice of the\r\npeace, and some of the wealthier townsmen) were covered with slates.\r\nThere was a total absence of regard for appearances befitting a village\r\nat the end of the world, which had nothing beyond it, and no connection\r\nwith any other place. The people who lived in it seemed to belong to one\r\nfamily that dwelt beyond the limits of the bustling world, with which\r\nthe collector of taxes and a few ties of the very slenderest alone\r\nserved to connect them.\r\n\r\nWhen Genestas had gone a step or two farther, he saw on the mountain\r\nside a broad road that rose above the village. Clearly there must be an\r\nold town and a new town; and, indeed, when the commandant reached a\r\nspot where he could slacken the pace of his horse, he could easily see\r\nbetween the houses some well-built dwellings whose new roofs brightened\r\nthe old-fashioned village. An avenue of trees rose above these new\r\nhouses, and from among them came the confused sounds of several\r\nindustries. He heard the songs peculiar to busy toilers, a murmur of\r\nmany workshops, the rasping of files, and the sound of falling hammers.\r\nHe saw the thin lines of smoke from the chimneys of each household, and\r\nthe more copious outpourings from the forges of the van-builder, the\r\nblacksmith, and the farrier. At length, at the very end of the village\r\ntowards which his guide was taking him, Genestas beheld scattered farms\r\nand well-tilled fields and plantations of trees in thorough order. It\r\nmight have been a little corner of Brie, so hidden away in a great fold\r\nof the land, that at first sight its existence would not be suspected\r\nbetween the little town and the mountains that closed the country round.\r\n\r\nPresently the child stopped.\r\n\r\n“There is the door of _his_ house,” he remarked.\r\n\r\nThe officer dismounted and passed his arm through the bridle. Then,\r\nthinking that the laborer is worthy of his hire, he drew a few sous\r\nfrom his waistcoat pocket, and held them out to the child, who looked\r\nastonished at this, opened his eyes very wide, and stayed on, without\r\nthanking him, to watch what the stranger would do next.\r\n\r\n“Civilization has not made much headway hereabouts,” thought Genestas;\r\n“the religion of work is in full force, and begging has not yet come\r\nthus far.”\r\n\r\nHis guide, more from curiosity than from any interested motive, propped\r\nhimself against the wall that rose to the height of a man’s elbow. Upon\r\nthis wall, which enclosed the yard belonging to the house, there ran a\r\nblack wooden railing on either side of the square pillars of the gates.\r\nThe lower part of the gates themselves was of solid wood that had been\r\npainted gray at some period in the past; the upper part consisted of\r\na grating of yellowish spear-shaped bars. These decorations, which had\r\nlost all their color, gradually rose on either half of the gates till\r\nthey reached the centre where they met; their spikes forming, when\r\nboth leaves were shut, an outline similar to that of a pine-cone. The\r\nworm-eaten gates themselves, with their patches of velvet lichen, were\r\nalmost destroyed by the alternate action of sun and rain. A few aloe\r\nplants and some chance-sown pellitory grew on the tops of the square\r\npillars of the gates, which all but concealed the stems of a couple of\r\nthornless acacias that raised their tufted spikes, like a pair of green\r\npowder-puffs, in the yard.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the gateway revealed a certain carelessness of its\r\nowner which did not seem to suit the officer’s turn of mind. He knitted\r\nhis brows like a man who is obliged to relinquish some illusion. We\r\nusually judge others by our own standard; and although we indulgently\r\nforgive our own shortcomings in them, we condemn them harshly for the\r\nlack of our special virtues. If the commandant had expected M. Benassis\r\nto be a methodical or practical man, there were unmistakable indications\r\nof absolute indifference as to his material concerns in the state of\r\nthe gates of his house. A soldier possessed by Genestas’ passion for\r\ndomestic economy could not help at once drawing inferences as to the\r\nlife and character of its owner from the gateway before him; and this,\r\nin spite of his habits of circumspection, he in nowise failed to do. The\r\ngates were left ajar, moreover--another piece of carelessness!\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this countrified trust in all comers, the officer entered\r\nthe yard without ceremony, and tethered his horse to the bars of the\r\ngate. While he was knotting the bridle, a neighing sound from the stable\r\ncaused both horse and rider to turn their eyes involuntarily in that\r\ndirection. The door opened, and an old servant put out his head. He wore\r\na red woolen bonnet, exactly like the Phrygian cap in which Liberty is\r\ntricked out, a piece of head-gear in common use in this country.\r\n\r\nAs there was room for several horses, this worthy individual, after\r\ninquiring whether Genestas had come to see M. Benassis, offered the\r\nhospitality of the stable to the newly-arrived steed, a very fine\r\nanimal, at which he looked with an expression of admiring affection. The\r\ncommandant followed his horse to see how things were to go with it. The\r\nstable was clean, there was plenty of litter, and there was the same\r\npeculiar air of sleek content about M. Benassis’ pair of horses that\r\ndistinguished the cure’s horse from all the rest of his tribe. A\r\nmaid-servant from within the house came out upon the flight of steps and\r\nwaited. She appeared to be the proper authority to whom the stranger’s\r\ninquiries were to be addressed, although the stableman had already told\r\nhim that M. Benassis was not at home.\r\n\r\n“The master has gone to the flour-mill,” said he. “If you like to\r\novertake him, you have only to go along the path that leads to the\r\nmeadow; and the mill is at the end of it.”\r\n\r\nGenestas preferred seeing the country to waiting about indefinitely\r\nfor Benassis’ return, so he set out along the way that led to the\r\nflour-mill. When he had gone beyond the irregular line traced by the\r\ntown upon the hillside, he came in sight of the mill and the valley, and\r\nof one of the loveliest landscapes that he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe mountains bar the course of the river, which forms a little lake at\r\ntheir feet, and raise their crests above it, tier on tier. Their many\r\nvalleys are revealed by the changing hues of the light, or by the more\r\nor less clear outlines of the mountain ridges fledged with their dark\r\nforests of pines. The mill had not long been built. It stood just where\r\nthe mountain stream fell into the little lake. There was all the charm\r\nabout it peculiar to a lonely house surrounded by water and hidden away\r\nbehind the heads of a few trees that love to grow by the water-side. On\r\nthe farther bank of the river, at the foot of a mountain, with a faint\r\nred glow of sunset upon its highest crest, Genestas caught a glimpse\r\nof a dozen deserted cottages. All the windows and doors had been taken\r\naway, and sufficiently large holes were conspicuous in the dilapidated\r\nroofs, but the surrounding land was laid out in fields that were highly\r\ncultivated, and the old garden spaces had been turned into meadows,\r\nwatered by a system of irrigation as artfully contrived as that in use\r\nin Limousin. Unconsciously the commandant paused to look at the ruins of\r\nthe village before him.\r\n\r\nHow is it that men can never behold any ruins, even of the humblest\r\nkind, without feeling deeply stirred? Doubtless it is because they seem\r\nto be a typical representation of evil fortune whose weight is felt so\r\ndifferently by different natures. The thought of death is called up by\r\na churchyard, but a deserted village puts us in mind of the sorrows of\r\nlife; death is but one misfortune always foreseen, but the sorrows of\r\nlife are infinite. Does not the thought of the infinite underlie all\r\ngreat melancholy?\r\n\r\nThe officer reached the stony path by the mill-pond before he could\r\nhit upon an explanation of this deserted village. The miller’s lad was\r\nsitting on some sacks of corn near the door of the house. Genestas asked\r\nfor M. Benassis.\r\n\r\n“M. Benassis went over there,” said the miller, pointing out one of the\r\nruined cottages.\r\n\r\n“Has the village been burned down?” asked the commandant.\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then how did it come to be in this state?” inquired Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Ah! how?” the miller answered, as he shrugged his shoulders and went\r\nindoors; “M. Benassis will tell you that.”\r\n\r\nThe officer went over a rough sort of bridge built up of boulders taken\r\nfrom the torrent bed, and soon reached the house that had been pointed\r\nout to him. The thatched roof of the dwelling was still entire; it was\r\ncovered with moss indeed, but there were no holes in it, and the door\r\nand its fastenings seemed to be in good repair. Genestas saw a fire on\r\nthe hearth as he entered, an old woman kneeling in the chimney-corner\r\nbefore a sick man seated in a chair, and another man, who was standing\r\nwith his face turned toward the fireplace. The house consisted of a\r\nsingle room, which was lighted by a wretched window covered with\r\nlinen cloth. The floor was of beaten earth; the chair, a table, and a\r\ntruckle-bed comprised the whole of the furniture. The commandant had\r\nnever seen anything so poor and bare, not even in Russia, where the\r\nmoujik’s huts are like the dens of wild beasts. Nothing within it\r\nspoke of ordinary life; there were not even the simplest appliances\r\nfor cooking food of the commonest description. It might have been\r\na dog-kennel without a drinking-pan. But for the truckle-bed, a\r\nsmock-frock hanging from a nail, and some sabots filled with straw,\r\nwhich composed the invalid’s entire wardrobe, this cottage would have\r\nlooked as empty as the others. The aged peasant woman upon her knees\r\nwas devoting all her attention to keeping the sufferer’s feet in a tub\r\nfilled with a brown liquid. Hearing a footstep and the clank of spurs,\r\nwhich sounded strangely in ears accustomed to the plodding pace of\r\ncountry folk, the man turned to Genestas. A sort of surprise, in which\r\nthe old woman shared was visible in his face.\r\n\r\n“There is no need to ask if you are M. Benassis,” said the soldier. “You\r\nwill pardon me, sir, if, as a stranger impatient to see you, I have come\r\nto seek you on your field of battle, instead of awaiting you at your\r\nhouse. Pray do not disturb yourself; go on with what you are doing. When\r\nit is over, I will tell you the purpose of my visit.”\r\n\r\nGenestas half seated himself upon the edge of the table, and remained\r\nsilent. The firelight shone more brightly in the room than the faint\r\nrays of the sun, for the mountain crests intercepted them, so that they\r\nseldom reached this corner of the valley. A few branches of resinous\r\npinewood made a bright blaze, and it was by the light of this fire\r\nthat the soldier saw the face of the man towards whom he was drawn by\r\na secret motive, by a wish to seek him out, to study and to know him\r\nthoroughly well. M. Benassis, the local doctor, heard Genestas with\r\nindifference, and with folded arms he returned his bow, and went back to\r\nhis patient, quite unaware that he was being subjected to a scrutiny as\r\nearnest as that which the soldier turned upon him.\r\n\r\nBenassis was a man of ordinary height, broad-shouldered and\r\ndeep-chested. A capacious green overcoat, buttoned up to the chin,\r\nprevented the officer from observing any characteristic details of his\r\npersonal appearance; but his dark and motionless figure served as a\r\nstrong relief to his face, which caught the bright light of the blazing\r\nfire. The face was not unlike that of a satyr; there was the same\r\nslightly protruding forehead, full, in this case, of prominences,\r\nall more or less denoting character; the same turned-up nose, with a\r\nsprightly cleavage at the tip; the same high cheek-bones. The lines of\r\nthe mouth were crooked; the lips, thick and red. The chin turned sharply\r\nupwards. There was an alert, animated look in the brown eyes, to which\r\ntheir pearly whites gave great brightness, and which expressed passions\r\nnow subdued. His iron-gray hair, the deep wrinkles in his face,\r\nthe bushy eyebrows that had grown white already, the veins on his\r\nprotuberant nose, the tanned face covered with red blotches, everything\r\nabout him, in short, indicated a man of fifty and the hard work of his\r\nprofession. The officer could come to no conclusion as to the capacity\r\nof the head, which was covered by a close cap; but hidden though it was,\r\nit seemed to him to be one of the square-shaped kind that gave rise\r\nto the expression “square-headed.” Genestas was accustomed to read the\r\nindications that mark the features of men destined to do great things,\r\nsince he had been brought into close relations with the energetic\r\nnatures sought out by Napoleon; so he suspected that there must be some\r\nmystery in this life of obscurity, and said to himself as he looked at\r\nthe remarkable face before him:\r\n\r\n“How comes it that he is still a country doctor?”\r\n\r\nWhen he had made a careful study of this countenance, that, in spite of\r\nits resemblance to other human faces, revealed an inner life nowise\r\nin harmony with a commonplace exterior, he could not help sharing\r\nthe doctor’s interest in his patient; and the sight of that patient\r\ncompletely changed the current of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nMuch as the old cavalry officer had seen in the course of his soldier’s\r\ncareer, he felt a thrill of surprise and horror at the sight of a human\r\nface which could never have been lighted up with thought--a livid face\r\nin which a look of dumb suffering showed so plainly--the same look that\r\nis sometimes worn by a child too young to speak, and too weak to cry any\r\nlonger; in short, it was the wholly animal face of an old dying cretin.\r\nThe cretin was the one variety of the human species with which the\r\ncommandant had not yet come in contact. At the sight of the deep,\r\ncircular folds of skin on the forehead, the sodden, fish-like eyes, and\r\nthe head, with its short, coarse, scantily-growing hair--a head\r\nutterly divested of all the faculties of the senses--who would not have\r\nexperienced, as Genestas did, an instinctive feeling of repulsion for a\r\nbeing that had neither the physical beauty of an animal nor the mental\r\nendowments of man, who was possessed of neither instinct nor reason, and\r\nwho had never heard nor spoken any kind of articulate speech? It seemed\r\ndifficult to expend any regrets over the poor wretch now visibly drawing\r\ntowards the very end of an existence which had not been life in any\r\nsense of the word; yet the old woman watched him with touching anxiety,\r\nand was rubbing his legs where the hot water did not reach them with as\r\nmuch tenderness as if he had been her husband. Benassis himself, after\r\na close scrutiny of the dull eyes and corpse-like face, gently took the\r\ncretin’s hand and felt his pulse.\r\n\r\n“The bath is doing no good,” he said, shaking his head; “let us put him\r\nto bed again.”\r\n\r\nHe lifted the inert mass himself, and carried him across to the\r\ntruckle-bed, from whence, no doubt, he had just taken him. Carefully he\r\nlaid him at full length, and straightened the limbs that were growing\r\ncold already, putting the head and hand in position, with all the heed\r\nthat a mother could bestow upon her child.\r\n\r\n“It is all over, death is very near,” added Benassis, who remained\r\nstanding by the bedside.\r\n\r\nThe old woman gazed at the dying form, with her hands on her hips. A few\r\ntears stole down her cheeks. Genestas remained silent. He was unable to\r\nexplain to himself how it was that the death of a being that concerned\r\nhim so little should affect him so much. Unconsciously he shared the\r\nfeeling of boundless pity that these hapless creatures excite among the\r\ndwellers in the sunless valleys wherein Nature has placed them. This\r\nsentiment has degenerated into a kind of religious superstition in\r\nfamilies to which cretins belong; but does it not spring from the most\r\nbeautiful of Christian virtues--from charity, and from a belief in a\r\nreward hereafter, that most effectual support of our social system,\r\nand the one thought that enables us to endure our miseries? The hope of\r\ninheriting eternal bliss helps the relations of these unhappy creatures\r\nand all others round about them to exert on a large scale, and with\r\nsublime devotion, a mother’s ceaseless protecting care over an apathetic\r\ncreature who does not understand it in the first instance, and who in\r\na little while forgets it all. Wonderful power of religion! that has\r\nbrought a blind beneficence to the aid of an equally blind misery.\r\nWherever cretins exist, there is a popular belief that the presence\r\nof one of these creatures brings luck to a family--a superstition that\r\nserves to sweeten lives which, in the midst of a town population,\r\nwould be condemned by a mistaken philanthropy to submit to the harsh\r\ndiscipline of an asylum. In the higher end of the valley of Isere, where\r\ncretins are very numerous, they lead an out-of-door life with the cattle\r\nwhich they are taught to herd. There, at any rate, they are at large,\r\nand receive the reverence due to misfortune.\r\n\r\nA moment later the village bell clinked at slow regular intervals, to\r\nacquaint the flock with the death of one of their number. In the sound\r\nthat reached the cottage but faintly across the intervening space, there\r\nwas a thought of religion which seemed to fill it with a melancholy\r\npeace. The tread of many feet echoed up the road, giving notice of\r\nan approaching crowd of people--a crowd that uttered not a word. Then\r\nsuddenly the chanting of the Church broke the stillness, calling up the\r\nconfused thoughts that take possession of the most sceptical minds, and\r\ncompel them to yield to the influence of the touching harmonies of the\r\nhuman voice. The Church was coming to the aid of a creature that knew\r\nher not. The cure appeared, preceded by a choir-boy, who bore the\r\ncrucifix, and followed by the sacristan carrying the vase of holy water,\r\nand by some fifty women, old men, and children, who had all come to add\r\ntheir prayers to those of the Church. The doctor and the soldier looked\r\nat each other, and silently withdrew to a corner to make room for the\r\nkneeling crowd within and without the cottage. During the consoling\r\nceremony of the Viaticum, celebrated for one who had never sinned, but\r\nto whom the Church on earth was bidding a last farewell, there were\r\nsigns of real sorrow on most of the rough faces of the gathering, and\r\ntears flowed over the rugged cheeks that sun and wind and labor in the\r\nfields had tanned and wrinkled. The sentiment of voluntary kinship was\r\neasy to explain. There was not one in the place who had not pitied the\r\nunhappy creature, not one who would not have given him his daily bread.\r\nHad he not met with a father’s care from every child, and found a mother\r\nin the merriest little girl?\r\n\r\n“He is dead!” said the cure.\r\n\r\nThe words struck his hearers with the most unfeigned dismay. The tall\r\ncandles were lighted, and several people undertook to watch with the\r\ndead that night. Benassis and the soldier went out. A group of peasants\r\nin the doorway stopped the doctor to say:\r\n\r\n“Ah! if you have not saved his life, sir, it was doubtless because God\r\nwished to take him to Himself.”\r\n\r\n“I did my best, children,” the doctor answered.\r\n\r\nWhen they had come a few paces from the deserted village, whose last\r\ninhabitant had just died, the doctor spoke to Genestas.\r\n\r\n“You would not believe, sir, what real solace is contained for me in\r\nwhat those peasants have just said. Ten years ago I was very nearly\r\nstoned to death in this village. It is empty to-day, but thirty families\r\nlived in it then.”\r\n\r\nGenestas’ face and gesture so plainly expressed an inquiry, that,\r\nas they went along, the doctor told him the story promised by this\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n“When I first settled here, sir, I found a dozen cretins in this part\r\nof the canton,” and the doctor turned round to point out the ruined\r\ncottages for the officer’s benefit. “All the favorable conditions for\r\nspreading the hideous disease are there; the air is stagnant, the hamlet\r\nlies in the valley bottom, close beside a torrent supplied with water\r\nby the melted snows, and the sunlight only falls on the mountain-top,\r\nso that the valley itself gets no good of the sun. Marriages among these\r\nunfortunate creatures are not forbidden by law, and in this district\r\nthey are protected by superstitious notions, of whose power I had no\r\nconception--superstitions which I blamed at first, and afterwards came\r\nto admire. So cretinism was in a fair way to spread all over the valley\r\nfrom this spot. Was it not doing the country a great service to put\r\na stop to this mental and physical contagion? But imperatively as the\r\nsalutary changes were required, they might cost the life of any man who\r\nendeavored to bring them about. Here, as in other social spheres, if\r\nany good is to be done, we come into collision not merely with\r\nvested interests, but with something far more dangerous to meddle\r\nwith--religious ideas crystallized into superstitions, the most\r\npermanent form taken by human thought. I feared nothing.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, I sought for the position of mayor in the canton,\r\nand in this I succeeded. Then, after obtaining a verbal sanction from\r\nthe prefect, and by paying down the money, I had several of these\r\nunfortunate creatures transported over to Aiguebelle, in Savoy, by\r\nnight. There are a great many of them there, and they were certain to\r\nbe very kindly treated. When this act of humanity came to be known, the\r\nwhole countryside looked upon me as a monster. The cure preached against\r\nme. In spite of all the pains I took to explain to all the shrewder\r\nheads of the little place the immense importance of being rid of the\r\nidiots, and in spite of the fact that I gave my services gratuitously to\r\nthe sick people of the district, a shot was fired at me from the corner\r\nof a wood.\r\n\r\n“I went to the Bishop of Grenoble and asked him to change the cure.\r\nMonseigneur was good enough to allow me to choose a priest who would\r\nshare in my labors, and it was my happy fortune to meet with one of\r\nthose rare natures that seemed to have dropped down from heaven. Then\r\nI went on with my enterprise. After preparing people’s minds, I made\r\nanother transportation by night, and six more cretins were taken away.\r\nIn this second attempt I had the support of several people to whom I had\r\nrendered some service, and I was backed by the members of the Communal\r\nCouncil, for I had appealed to their parsimonious instincts, showing\r\nthem how much it cost to support the poor wretches, and pointing out how\r\nlargely they might gain by converting their plots of ground (to which\r\nthe idiots had no proper title) into allotments which were needed in the\r\ntownship.\r\n\r\n“All the rich were on my side; but the poor, the old women, the\r\nchildren, and a few pig-headed people were violently opposed to me.\r\nUnluckily it so fell out that my last removal had not been completely\r\ncarried out. The cretin whom you have just seen, not having returned to\r\nhis house, had not been taken away, so that the next morning he was the\r\nsole remaining example of his species in the village. There were several\r\nfamilies still living there; but though they were little better than\r\nidiots, they were, at any rate, free from the taint of cretinism. I\r\ndetermined to go through with my work, and came officially in open day\r\nto take the luckless creature from his dwelling. I had no sooner left\r\nmy house than my intention got abroad. The cretin’s friends were there\r\nbefore me, and in front of his hovel I found a crowd of women and\r\nchildren and old people, who hailed my arrival with insults accompanied\r\nby a shower of stones.\r\n\r\n“In the midst of the uproar I should perhaps have fallen a victim to the\r\nfrenzy that possesses a crowd excited by its own outcries and stirred up\r\nby one common feeling, but the cretin saved my life! The poor creature\r\ncame out of his hut, and raised the clucking sound of his voice. He\r\nseemed to be an absolute ruler over the fanatical mob, for the sight\r\nof him put a sudden stop to the clamor. It occurred to me that I might\r\narrange a compromise, and thanks to the quiet so opportunely restored, I\r\nwas able to propose and explain it. Of course, those who approved of my\r\nschemes would not dare to second me in this emergency, their support\r\nwas sure to be of a purely passive kind, while these superstitious folk\r\nwould exert the most active vigilance to keep their last idol among\r\nthem; it was impossible, it seemed to me, to take him away from them.\r\nSo I promised to leave the cretin in peace in his dwelling, with\r\nthe understanding that he should live quite by himself, and that the\r\nremaining families in the village should cross the stream and come to\r\nlive in the town, in some new houses which I myself undertook to build,\r\nadding to each house a piece of ground for which the Commune was to\r\nrepay me later on.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear sir, it took me fully six months to overcome their\r\nobjection to this bargain, however much it may have been to the\r\nadvantage of the village families. The affection which they have\r\nfor their wretched hovels in country districts is something quite\r\nunexplainable. No matter how unwholesome his hovel may be, a peasant\r\nclings far more to it than a banker does to his mansion. The reason of\r\nit? That I do not know. Perhaps thoughts and feelings are strongest\r\nin those who have but few of them, simply because they have but few.\r\nPerhaps material things count for much in the lives of those who live\r\nso little in thought; certain it is that the less they have, the dearer\r\ntheir possessions are to them. Perhaps, too, it is with the peasant\r\nas with the prisoner--he does not squander the powers of his soul, he\r\ncentres them all upon a single idea, and this is how his feelings come\r\nto be so exceedingly strong. Pardon these reflections on the part of a\r\nman who seldom exchanges ideas with any one. But, indeed, you must\r\nnot suppose, sir, that I am much taken up with these far-fetched\r\nconsiderations. We all have to be active and practical here.\r\n\r\n“Alas! the fewer ideas these poor folk have in their heads, the harder\r\nit is to make them see where their real interests lie. There was nothing\r\nfor it but to give my whole attention to every trifling detail of my\r\nenterprise. One and all made me the same answer, one of those sayings,\r\nfilled with homely sense, to which there is no possible reply, ‘But your\r\nhouses are not yet built, sir!’ they used to say. ‘Very good,’ said I,\r\n‘promise me that as soon as they are finished you will come and live in\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\n“Luckily, sir, I obtained a decision to the effect that the whole of\r\nthe mountain side above the now deserted village was the property of the\r\ntownship. The sum of money brought in by the woods on the higher slopes\r\npaid for the building of the new houses and for the land on which they\r\nstood. They were built forthwith; and when once one of my refractory\r\nfamilies was fairly settled in, the rest of them were not slow to\r\nfollow. The benefits of the change were so evident that even the most\r\nbigoted believer in the village, which you might call soulless as well\r\nas sunless, could not but appreciate them. The final decision in this\r\nmatter, which gave some property to the Commune, in the possession of\r\nwhich we were confirmed by the Council of State, made me a person of\r\ngreat importance in the canton. But what a lot of worry there was over\r\nit!” the doctor remarked, stopping short, and raising a hand which he\r\nlet fall again--a gesture that spoke volumes. “No one knows, as I do,\r\nthe distance between the town and the Prefecture--whence nothing comes\r\nout--and from the Prefecture to the Council of State--where nothing can\r\nbe got in.\r\n\r\n“Well, after all,” he resumed, “peace be to the powers of this world!\r\nThey yielded to my importunities, and that is saying a great deal. If\r\nyou only knew the good that came of a carelessly scrawled signature!\r\nWhy, sir, two years after I had taken these momentous trifles in hand,\r\nand had carried the matter through to the end, every poor family in the\r\nCommune had two cows at least, which they pastured on the mountain side,\r\nwhere (without waiting this time for an authorization from the Council\r\nof State) I had established a system of irrigation by means of cross\r\ntrenches, like those in Switzerland, Auvergne, and Limousin. Much to\r\ntheir astonishment, the townspeople saw some capital meadows springing\r\nup under their eyes, and thanks to the improvement in the pasturage,\r\nthe yield of milk was very much larger. The results of this triumph\r\nwere great indeed. Every one followed the example set by my system of\r\nirrigation; cattle were multiplied; the area of meadow land and every\r\nkind of out-turn increased. I had nothing to fear after that. I could\r\ncontinue my efforts to improve this, as yet, untilled corner of the\r\nearth; and to civilize those who dwelt in it, whose minds had hitherto\r\nlain dormant.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, folk like us, who live out of the world, are very talkative.\r\nIf you ask us a question, there is no knowing where the answer will come\r\nto an end; but to cut it short--there were about seven hundred souls in\r\nthe valley when I came to it, and now the population numbers some two\r\nthousand. I had gained the good opinion of every one in that matter of\r\nthe last cretin; and when I had constantly shown that I could rule both\r\nmildly and firmly, I became a local oracle. I did everything that I\r\ncould to win their confidence; I did not ask for it, nor did I appear to\r\nseek it; but I tried to inspire every one with the deepest respect\r\nfor my character, by the scrupulous way in which I always fulfilled my\r\nengagements, even when they were of the most trifling kind. When I had\r\npledged myself to care for the poor creature whose death you have just\r\nwitnessed, I looked after him much more effectually than any of his\r\nprevious guardians had done. He has been fed and cared for as the\r\nadopted child of the Commune. After a time the dwellers in the valley\r\nended by understanding the service which I had done them in spite of\r\nthemselves, but for all that, they still cherish some traces of that old\r\nsuperstition of theirs. Far be it from me to blame them for it; has not\r\ntheir cult of the cretin often furnished me with an argument when I have\r\ntried to induce those who had possession of their faculties to help\r\nthe unfortunate? But here we are,” said Benassis, when after a moment’s\r\npause he saw the roof of his own house.\r\n\r\nFar from expecting the slightest expression of praise or of thanks from\r\nhis listener, it appeared from his way of telling the story of this\r\nepisode in his administrative career, that he had been moved by an\r\nunconscious desire to pour out the thoughts that filled his mind, after\r\nthe manner of folk that live very retired lives.\r\n\r\n“I have taken the liberty of putting my horse in your stable, sir,” said\r\nthe commandant, “for which in your goodness you will perhaps pardon me\r\nwhen you learn the object of my journey hither.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, what is it?” asked Benassis, appearing to shake off his\r\npreoccupied mood, and to recollect that his companion was a stranger\r\nto him. The frankness and unreserve of his nature had led him to accept\r\nGenestas as an acquaintance.\r\n\r\n“I have heard of the almost miraculous recovery of M. Gravier of\r\nGrenoble, whom you received into your house,” was the soldier’s answer.\r\n“I have come to you, hoping that you will give a like attention to my\r\ncase, although I have not a similar claim to your benevolence; and yet,\r\nI am possibly not undeserving of it. I am an old soldier, and wounds\r\nof long standing give me no peace. It will take you at least a week to\r\nstudy my condition, for the pain only comes back at intervals, and----”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” Benassis broke in; “M. Gravier’s room is in readiness.\r\nCome in.”\r\n\r\nThey went into the house, the doctor flinging open the door with an\r\neagerness that Genestas attributed to his pleasure at receiving a\r\nboarder.\r\n\r\n“Jacquotte!” Benassis called out. “This gentleman will dine with us.”\r\n\r\n“But would it not be as well for us to settle about the payment?”\r\n\r\n“Payment for what?” inquired the doctor.\r\n\r\n“For my board. You cannot keep me and my horse as well, without----”\r\n\r\n“If you are wealthy, you will repay me amply,” Benassis replied; “and if\r\nyou are not, I will take nothing whatever.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing whatever seems to me to be too dear,” said Genestas. “But,\r\nrich or poor, will ten francs a day (not including your professional\r\nservices) be acceptable to you?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be less acceptable to me than payment for the pleasure of\r\nentertaining a visitor,” the doctor answered, knitting his brows; “and\r\nas to my advice, you shall have it if I like you, and not unless. Rich\r\npeople shall not have my time by paying for it; it belongs exclusively\r\nto the folk here in the valley. I do not care about fame or fortune, and\r\nI look for neither praise or gratitude from my patients. Any money which\r\nyou may pay me will go to the druggists in Grenoble, to pay for the\r\nmedicine required by the poor of the neighborhood.”\r\n\r\nAny one who had heard the words flung out, abruptly, it is true, but\r\nwithout a trace of bitterness in them, would have said to himself with\r\nGenestas, “Here is a man made of good human clay.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I will pay you ten francs a day, sir,” the soldier\r\nanswered, returning to the charge with wonted pertinacity, “and you will\r\ndo as you choose after that. We shall understand each other better, now\r\nthat the question is settled,” he added, grasping the doctor’s hand with\r\neager cordiality. “In spite of my ten francs, you shall see that I am by\r\nno means a Tartar.”\r\n\r\nAfter this passage of arms, in which Benassis showed not the slightest\r\nsign of a wish to appear generous or to pose as a philanthropist, the\r\nsupposed invalid entered his doctor’s house. Everything within it was\r\nin keeping with the ruinous state of the gateway, and with the clothing\r\nworn by its owner. There was an utter disregard for everything not\r\nessentially useful, which was visible even in the smallest trifles.\r\nBenassis took Genestas through the kitchen, that being the shortest way\r\nto the dining-room.\r\n\r\nHad the kitchen belonged to an inn, it could not have been more\r\nsmoke-begrimed; and if there was a sufficiency of cooking pots within\r\nits precincts, this lavish supply was Jacquotte’s doing--Jacquotte who\r\nhad formerly been the cure’s housekeeper--Jacquotte who always said\r\n“we,” and who ruled supreme over the doctor’s household. If, for\r\ninstance, there was a brightly polished warming-pan above the\r\nmantelshelf, it probably hung there because Jacquotte liked to sleep\r\nwarm of a winter night, which led her incidentally to warm her master’s\r\nsheets. He never took a thought about anything; so she was wont to say.\r\n\r\nIt was on account of a defect, which any one else would have found\r\nintolerable, that Benassis had taken her into his service. Jacquotte had\r\na mind to rule the house, and a woman who would rule his house was the\r\nvery person that the doctor wanted. So Jacquotte bought and sold,\r\nmade alterations about the place, set up and took down, arranged and\r\ndisarranged everything at her own sweet will; her master had never\r\nraised a murmur. Over the yard, the stable, the man-servant and the\r\nkitchen, in fact, over the whole house and garden and its master,\r\nJacquotte’s sway was absolute. She looked out fresh linen, saw to the\r\nwashing, and laid in provisions without consulting anybody. She decided\r\neverything that went on in the house, and the date when the pigs were to\r\nbe killed. She scolded the gardener, decreed the menu at breakfast\r\nand dinner, and went from cellar to garret, and from garret to cellar,\r\nsetting everything to rights according to her notions, without a word\r\nof opposition of any sort or description. Benassis had made but two\r\nstipulations--he wished to dine at six o’clock, and that the household\r\nexpenses should not exceed a certain fixed sum every month.\r\n\r\nA woman whom every one obeys in this way is always singing, so Jacquotte\r\nlaughed and warbled on the staircase; she was always humming something\r\nwhen she was not singing, and singing when she was not humming.\r\nJacquotte had a natural liking for cleanliness, so she kept the house\r\nneat and clean. If her tastes had been different, it would have been a\r\nsad thing for M. Benassis (so she was wont to say), for the poor man was\r\nso little particular that you might feed him on cabbage for partridges,\r\nand he would not find it out; and if it were not for her, he would very\r\noften wear the same shirt for a week on end. Jacquotte, however, was an\r\nindefatigable folder of linen, a born rubber and polisher of furniture,\r\nand a passionate lover of a perfectly religious and ceremonial\r\ncleanliness of the most scrupulous, the most radiant, and most fragrant\r\nkind. A sworn foe to dust, she swept and scoured and washed without\r\nceasing.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the gateway caused her acute distress. On the first day\r\nof every month for the past ten years, she had extorted from her master\r\na promise that he would replace the gate with a new one, that the walls\r\nof the house should be lime-washed, and that everything should be made\r\nquite straight and proper about the place; but so far, the master had\r\nnot kept his word. So it happened that whenever she fell to lamenting\r\nover Benassis’ deeply-rooted carelessness about things, she nearly\r\nalways ended solemnly in these words with which all her praises of her\r\nmaster usually terminated:\r\n\r\n“You cannot say that he is a fool, because he works such miracles, as\r\nyou may say, in the place; but, all the same, he is a fool at times,\r\nsuch a fool that you have to do everything for him as if he were a\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\nJacquotte loved the house as if it had belonged to her; and when she had\r\nlived in it for twenty-two years, had she not some grounds for deluding\r\nherself on that head? After the cure’s death the house had been for\r\nsale; and Benassis, who had only just come into the country, had bought\r\nit as it stood, with the walls about it and the ground belonging to\r\nit, together with the plate, wine, and furniture, the old sundial,\r\nthe poultry, the horse, and the woman-servant. Jacquotte was the very\r\npattern of a working housekeeper, with her clumsy figure, and her\r\nbodice, always of the same dark brown print with large red spots on it,\r\nwhich fitted her so tightly that it looked as if the material must\r\ngive way if she moved at all. Her colorless face, with its double chin,\r\nlooked out from under a round plaited cap, which made her look paler\r\nthan she really was. She talked incessantly, and always in a loud\r\nvoice--this short, active woman, with the plump, busy hands. Indeed, if\r\nJacquotte was silent for a moment, and took a corner of her apron so as\r\nto turn it up in a triangle, it meant that a lengthy expostulation was\r\nabout to be delivered for the benefit of master or man. Jacquotte was\r\nbeyond all doubt the happiest cook in the kingdom; for, that nothing\r\nmight be lacking in a measure of felicity as great as may be known in\r\nthis world below, her vanity was continually gratified--the townspeople\r\nregarded her as an authority of an indefinite kind, and ranked her\r\nsomewhere between the mayor and the park-keeper.\r\n\r\nThe master of the house found nobody in the kitchen when he entered it.\r\n\r\n“Where the devil are they all gone?” he asked. “Pardon me for bringing\r\nyou in this way,” he went on, turning to Genestas. “The front entrance\r\nopens into the garden, but I am so little accustomed to receive visitors\r\nthat--Jacquotte!” he called in rather peremptory tones.\r\n\r\nA woman’s voice answered to the name from the interior of the house. A\r\nmoment later Jacquotte, assuming the offensive, called in her turn to\r\nBenassis, who forthwith went into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“Just like you, sir!” she exclaimed; “you never do like anybody else.\r\nYou always ask people to dinner without telling me beforehand, and\r\nyou think that everything is settled as soon as you have called for\r\nJacquotte! You are not going to have the gentleman sit in the kitchen,\r\nare you? Is not the salon to be unlocked and a fire to be lighted?\r\nNicolle is there, and will see after everything. Now take the gentleman\r\ninto the garden for a minute; that will amuse him; if he likes to look\r\nat pretty things, show him the arbor of hornbeam trees that the poor\r\ndear old gentleman made. I shall have time then to lay the cloth, and to\r\nget everything ready, the dinner and the salon too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. But, Jacquotte,” Benassis went on, “the gentleman is going to stay\r\nwith us. Do not forget to give a look round M. Gravier’s room, and see\r\nabout the sheets and things, and----”\r\n\r\n“Now you are not going to interfere about the sheets, are you?” asked\r\nJacquotte. “If he is to sleep here, I know what must be done for him\r\nperfectly well. You have not so much as set foot in M. Gravier’s room\r\nthese ten months past. There is nothing to see there, the place is as\r\nclean as a new pin. Then will the gentleman make some stay here?” she\r\ncontinued in a milder tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“How long will he stay?”\r\n\r\n“Faith, I do not know: What does it matter to you?”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter to me, sir? Oh! very well, what does it matter\r\nto me? Did any one ever hear the like! And the provisions and all that\r\nand----”\r\n\r\nAt any other time she would have overwhelmed her master with reproaches\r\nfor his breach of trust, but now she followed him into the kitchen\r\nbefore the torrent of words had come to an end. She had guessed that\r\nthere was a prospect of a boarder, and was eager to see Genestas, to\r\nwhom she made a very deferential courtesy, while she scanned him from\r\nhead to foot. A thoughtful and dejected expression gave a harsh look\r\nto the soldier’s face. In the dialogue between master and servant the\r\nlatter had appeared to him in the light of a nonentity; and although he\r\nregretted the fact, this revelation had lessened the high opinion that\r\nhe had formed of the man whose persistent efforts to save the district\r\nfrom the horrors of cretinism had won his admiration.\r\n\r\n“I do not like the looks of that fellow at all!” said Jacquotte to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“If you are not tired, sir,” said the doctor to his supposed patient,\r\n“we will take a turn round the garden before dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” answered the commandant.\r\n\r\nThey went through the dining-room, and reached the garden by way of a\r\nsort of vestibule at the foot of the staircase between the salon and\r\nthe dining-room. Beyond a great glass door at the farther end of the\r\nvestibule lay a flight of stone steps which adorned the garden side\r\nof the house. The garden itself was divided into four large squares of\r\nequal size by two paths that intersected each other in the form of a\r\ncross, a box edging along their sides. At the farther end there was a\r\nthick, green alley of hornbeam trees, which had been the joy and pride\r\nof the late owner. The soldier seated himself on a worm-eaten bench, and\r\nsaw neither the trellis-work nor the espaliers, nor the vegetables of\r\nwhich Jacquotte took such great care. She followed the traditions of the\r\nepicurean churchman to whom this valuable garden owed its origin; but\r\nBenassis himself regarded it with sufficient indifference.\r\n\r\nThe commandant turned their talk from the trivial matters which had\r\noccupied them by saying to the doctor:\r\n\r\n“How comes it, sir, that the population of the valley has been trebled\r\nin ten years? There were seven hundred souls in it when you came, and\r\nto-day you say that they number more than two thousand.”\r\n\r\n“You are the first person who has put that question to me,” the doctor\r\nanswered. “Though it has been my aim to develop the capabilities of this\r\nlittle corner of the earth to the utmost, the constant pressure of a\r\nbusy life has not left me time to think over the way in which (like the\r\nmendicant brother) I have made ‘broth from a flint’ on a large scale.\r\nM. Gravier himself, who is one of several who have done a great deal for\r\nus, and to whom I was able to render a service by re-establishing his\r\nhealth, has never given a thought to the theory, though he has been\r\neverywhere over our mountain sides with me, to see its practical\r\nresults.”\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s silence, during which Benassis followed his own\r\nthoughts, careless of the keen glance by which his guest friend tried to\r\nfathom him.\r\n\r\n“You ask how it came about, my dear sir?” the doctor resumed. “It came\r\nabout quite naturally through the working of the social law by which the\r\nneed and the means of supplying it are correlated. Herein lies the whole\r\nstory. Races who have no wants are always poor. When I first came\r\nto live here in this township, there were about a hundred and thirty\r\npeasant families in it, and some two hundred hearths in the valley.\r\nThe local authorities were such as might be expected in the prevailing\r\nwretchedness of the population. The mayor himself could not write, and\r\nthe deputy-mayor was a small farmer, who lived beyond the limits of the\r\nCommune. The justice of the peace was a poor devil who had nothing but\r\nhis salary, and who was forced to relinquish the registration of births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths to his clerk, another hapless wretch who was\r\nscarcely able to understand his duties. The old cure had died at the age\r\nof seventy, and his curate, a quite uneducated man, had just succeeded\r\nto his position. These people comprised all the intelligence of the\r\ndistrict over which they ruled.\r\n\r\n“Those who dwelt amidst these lovely natural surroundings groveled in\r\nsqualor and lived upon potatoes, milk, butter, and cheese. The only\r\nproduce that brought in any money was the cheese, which most of them\r\ncarried in small baskets to Grenoble or its outskirts. The richer or\r\nthe more energetic among them sowed buckwheat for home consumption;\r\nsometimes they raised a crop of barley or oats, but wheat was unknown.\r\nThe only trader in the place was the mayor, who owned a sawmill and\r\nbought up timber at a low price to sell again. In the absence of roads,\r\nhis tree trunks had to be transported during the summer season; each log\r\nwas dragged along one at a time, and with no small difficulty, by means\r\nof a chain attached to a halter about his horse’s neck, and an iron hook\r\nat the farther end of the chain, which was driven into the wood. Any\r\none who went to Grenoble, whether on horseback or afoot, was obliged to\r\nfollow a track high up on the mountain side, for the valley was quite\r\nimpassable. The pretty road between this place and the first village\r\nthat you reach as you come into the canton (the way along which you must\r\nhave come) was nothing but a slough at all seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n“Political events and revolutions had never reached this inaccessible\r\ncountry--it lay completely beyond the limits of social stir and change.\r\nNapoleon’s name, and his alone, had penetrated hither; he is held in\r\ngreat veneration, thanks to one or two old soldiers who have returned to\r\ntheir native homes, and who of evenings tell marvelous tales about his\r\nadventures and his armies for the benefit of these simple folk. Their\r\ncoming back is, moreover, a puzzle that no one can explain. Before I\r\ncame here, the young men who went into the army all stayed in it for\r\ngood. This fact in itself is a sufficient revelation of the wretched\r\ncondition of the country. I need not give you a detailed description of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“This, then, was the state of things when I first came to the canton,\r\nwhich has several contented, well-tilled, and fairly prosperous communes\r\nbelonging to it upon the other side of the mountains. I will say nothing\r\nabout the hovels in the town; they were neither more nor less than\r\nstables, in which men and animals were indiscriminately huddled\r\ntogether. As there was no inn in the place, I was obliged to ask the\r\ncurate for a bed, he being in possession, for the time being, of this\r\nhouse, then offered for sale. Putting to him question after question,\r\nI came to have some slight knowledge of the lamentable condition of the\r\ncountry with the pleasant climate, the fertile soil, and the natural\r\nproductiveness that had impressed me so much.\r\n\r\n“At that time, sir, I was seeking to shape a future for myself that\r\nshould be as little as possible like the troubled life that had left me\r\nweary; and one of those thoughts came into my mind that God gives us at\r\ntimes, to enable us to take up our burdens and bear them. I resolved to\r\ndevelop all the resources of this country, just as a tutor develops\r\nthe capacities of a child. Do not think too much of my benevolence; the\r\npressing need that I felt for turning my thoughts into fresh channels\r\nentered too much into my motives. I had determined to give up the\r\nremainder of my life to some difficult task. A lifetime would be\r\nrequired to bring about the needful changes in a canton that Nature had\r\nmade so wealthy, and man so poor; and I was tempted by the practical\r\ndifficulties that stood in the way. As soon as I found that I could\r\nsecure the cure’s house and plenty of waste land at a small cost, I\r\nsolemnly devoted myself to the calling of a country surgeon--the very\r\nlast position that a man aspires to take. I determined to become the\r\nfriend of the poor, and to expect no reward of any kind from them. Oh! I\r\ndid not indulge in any illusions as to the nature of the country people,\r\nnor as to the hindrances that lie in the way of every attempt to bring\r\nabout a better state of things among men or their surroundings. I have\r\nnever made idyllic pictures of my people; I have taken them at their\r\njust worth--as poor peasants, neither wholly good nor wholly bad, whose\r\nconstant toil never allows them to indulge in emotion, though they can\r\nfeel acutely at times. Above all things, in fact, I clearly understood\r\nthat I should do nothing with them except through an appeal to their\r\nselfish interests, and by schemes for their immediate well-being.\r\nThe peasants are one and all the sons of St. Thomas, the doubting\r\napostle--they always like words to be supported by visible facts.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will laugh at my first start, sir,” the doctor went on\r\nafter a pause. “I began my difficult enterprise by introducing the\r\nmanufacture of baskets. The poor folks used to buy the wicker mats\r\non which they drain their cheeses, and all the baskets needed for the\r\ninsignificant trade of the district. I suggested to an intelligent young\r\nfellow that he might take a lease on a good-sized piece of land by the\r\nside of the torrent. Every year the floods deposited a rich alluvial\r\nsoil on this spot, where there should be no difficulty in growing\r\nosiers. I reckoned out the quantity of wicker-work of various kinds\r\nrequired from time to time by the canton, and went over to Grenoble,\r\nwhere I found a young craftsman, a clever worker, but without any\r\ncapital. When I had discovered him, I soon made up my mind to set him\r\nup in business here. I undertook to advance the money for the osiers\r\nrequired for his work until my osier-farmer should be in a position to\r\nsupply him. I induced him to sell his baskets at rather lower prices\r\nthan they asked for them in Grenoble, while, at the same time, they were\r\nbetter made. He entered into my views completely. The osier-beds and\r\nthe basket-making were two business speculations whose results were only\r\nappreciated after a lapse of four years. Of course, you know that osiers\r\nmust be three years old before they are fit to cut.\r\n\r\n“At the commencement of operations, the basket-maker was boarded and\r\nlodged gratuitously. Before very long he married a woman from Saint\r\nLaurent du Pont, who had a little money. Then he had a house built, in\r\na healthy and very airy situation which I chose, and my advice was\r\nfollowed as to the internal arrangements. Here was a triumph! I had\r\ncreated a new industry, and had brought a producer and several workers\r\ninto the town. I wonder if you will regard my elations as childish?\r\n\r\n“For the first few days after my basket-maker had set up his business,\r\nI never went past his shop but my heart beat somewhat faster. And when\r\nI saw the newly-built house, with the green-painted shutters, the vine\r\nbeside the doorway, and the bench and bundles of osiers before it; when\r\nI saw a tidy, neatly-dressed woman within it, nursing a plump, pink\r\nand white baby among the workmen, who were singing merrily and busily\r\nplaiting their wicker-work under the superintendence of a man who but\r\nlately had looked so pinched and pale, but now had an atmosphere of\r\nprosperity about him; when I saw all this, I confess that I could not\r\nforego the pleasure of turning basket-maker for a moment, of going into\r\nthe shop to hear how things went with them, and of giving myself up to\r\na feeling of content that I cannot express in words, for I had all\r\ntheir happiness as well as my own to make me glad. All my hopes became\r\ncentered on this house, where the man dwelt who had been the first to\r\nput a steady faith in me. Like the basket-maker’s wife, clasping her\r\nfirst nursling to her breast, did not I already fondly cherish the hopes\r\nof the future of this poor district?\r\n\r\n“I had to do so many things at once,” he went on, “I came into collision\r\nwith other people’s notions, and met with violent opposition, fomented\r\nby the ignorant mayor to whose office I had succeeded, and whose\r\ninfluence had dwindled away as mine increased. I determined to make him\r\nmy deputy and a confederate in my schemes of benevolence. Yes, in the\r\nfirst place, I endeavored to instil enlightened ideas into the densest\r\nof all heads. Through his self-love and cupidity I gained a hold upon my\r\nman. During six months as we dined together, I took him deeply into my\r\nconfidence about my projected improvements. Many people would think this\r\nintimacy one of the most painful inflictions in the course of my task;\r\nbut was he not a tool of the most valuable kind? Woe to him who despises\r\nhis axe, or flings it carelessly aside! Would it not have been very\r\ninconsistent, moreover, if I, who wished to improve a district, had\r\nshrunk back at the thought of improving one man in it?\r\n\r\n“A road was our first and most pressing need in bringing about a better\r\nstate of things. If we could obtain permission from the Municipal\r\nCouncil to make a hard road, so as to put us in communication with the\r\nhighway to Grenoble, the deputy-mayor would be the first gainer by it;\r\nfor instead of dragging his timber over rough tracks at a great expense,\r\na good road through the canton would enable him to transport it more\r\neasily, and to engage in a traffic on a large scale, in all kinds of\r\nwood, that would bring in money--not a miserable six hundred francs a\r\nyear, but handsome sums which would mean a certain fortune for him some\r\nday. Convinced at last, he became my proselytizer.\r\n\r\n“Through the whole of one winter the ex-mayor got into the way of\r\nexplaining to our citizens that a good road for wheeled traffic would be\r\na source of wealth to the whole country round, for it would enable\r\nevery one to do a trade with Grenoble; he held forth on this head at the\r\ntavern while drinking with his intimates. When the Municipal Council had\r\nauthorized the making of the road, I went to the prefect and obtained\r\nsome money from the charitable funds at the disposal of the department,\r\nin order to pay for the hire of carts, for the Commune was unable to\r\nundertake the transport of road metal for lack of wheeled conveyances.\r\nThe ignorant began to murmur against me, and to say that I wanted to\r\nbring the days of the corvee back again; this made me anxious to finish\r\nthis important work, that they might speedily appreciate its benefits.\r\nWith this end in view, every Sunday during my first year of office I\r\ndrew the whole population of the township, willing or unwilling, up on\r\nto the mountain, where I myself had traced out on a hard bottom the road\r\nbetween our village and the highway to Grenoble. Materials for making it\r\nwere fortunately to be had in plenty along the site.\r\n\r\n“The tedious enterprise called for a great deal of patience on my part.\r\nSome who were ignorant of the law would refuse at times to give their\r\ncontribution of labor; others again, who had not bread to eat, really\r\ncould not afford to lose a day. Corn had to be distributed among these\r\nlast, and the others must be soothed with friendly words. Yet by the\r\ntime we had finished two-thirds of the road, which in all is about\r\ntwo leagues in length, the people had so thoroughly recognized its\r\nadvantages that the remaining third was accomplished with a spirit that\r\nsurprised me. I added to the future wealth of the Commune by planting\r\na double row of poplars along the ditch on either side of the way. The\r\ntrees are already almost worth a fortune, and they make our road\r\nlook like a king’s highway. It is almost always dry, by reason of its\r\nposition, and it was so well made that the annual cost of maintaining it\r\nis a bare two hundred francs. I must show it to you, for you cannot\r\nhave seen it; you must have come by the picturesque way along the valley\r\nbottom, a road which the people decided to make for themselves three\r\nyears later, so as to connect the various farms that were made there\r\nat that time. In three years ideas had rooted themselves in the common\r\nsense of this township, hitherto so lacking in intelligence that a\r\npassing traveler would perhaps have thought it hopeless to attempt to\r\ninstil them. But to continue.\r\n\r\n“The establishment of the basket-maker was an example set before these\r\npoverty-stricken folk that they might profit by it. And if the road was\r\nto be a direct cause of the future wealth of the canton, all the primary\r\nforms of industry must be stimulated, or these two germs of a better\r\nstate of things would come to nothing. My own work went forward by slow\r\ndegrees, as I helped my osier farmer and wicker-worker and saw to the\r\nmaking of the road.\r\n\r\n“I had two horses, and the timber merchant, the deputy-mayor, had three.\r\nHe could only have them shod whenever he went over to Grenoble, so I\r\ninduced a farrier to take up his abode here, and undertook to find him\r\nplenty of work. On the same day I met with a discharged soldier, who\r\nhad nothing but his pension of a hundred francs, and was sufficiently\r\nperplexed about his future. He could read and write, so I engaged him\r\nas secretary to the mayor; as it happened, I was lucky enough to find a\r\nwife for him, and his dreams of happiness were fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“Both of these new families needed houses, as well as the basket-maker\r\nand twenty-two others from the cretin village, soon afterwards twelve\r\nmore households were established in the place. The workers in each of\r\nthese families were at once producers and consumers. They were masons,\r\ncarpenters, joiners, slaters, blacksmiths, and glaziers; and there was\r\nwork enough to last them for a long time, for had they not their own\r\nhouses to build when they had finished those for other people? Seventy,\r\nin fact, were build in the Commune during my second year of office. One\r\nform of production demands another. The additions to the population\r\nof the township had created fresh wants, hitherto unknown among these\r\ndwellers in poverty. The wants gave rise to industries, and industries\r\nto trade, and the gains of trade raised the standard of comfort, which\r\nin its turn gave them practical ideas.\r\n\r\n“The various workmen wished to buy their bread ready baked, so we came\r\nto have a baker. Buckwheat could no longer be the food of a population\r\nwhich, awakened from its lethargy, had become essentially active. They\r\nlived on buckwheat when I first came among them, and I wished to effect\r\na change to rye, or a mixture of rye and wheat in the first instance,\r\nand finally to see a loaf of white bread even in the poorest household.\r\nIntellectual progress, to my thinking, was entirely dependent on a\r\ngeneral improvement in the conditions of life. The presence of a butcher\r\nin the district says as much for its intelligence as for its wealth. The\r\nworker feeds himself, and a man who feeds himself thinks. I had made a\r\nvery careful study of the soil, for I foresaw a time when it would be\r\nnecessary to grow wheat. I was sure of launching the place in a very\r\nprosperous agricultural career, and of doubling the population, when\r\nonce it had begun to work. And now the time had come.\r\n\r\n“M. Gravier, of Grenoble, owned a great deal of land in the commune,\r\nwhich brought him in no rent, but which might be turned into\r\ncorn-growing land. He is the head of a department in the Prefecture, as\r\nyou know. It was a kindness for his own countryside quite as much as my\r\nearnest entreaties that won him over. He had very benevolently yielded\r\nto my importunities on former occasions, and I succeeded in making it\r\nclear to him that in so doing he had wrought unconsciously for his own\r\nbenefit. After several days spent in pleadings, consultation, and talk,\r\nthe matter was thrashed out. I undertook to guarantee him against\r\nall risks in the undertaking, from which his wife, a woman of no\r\nimagination, sought to frighten him. He agreed to build four farmhouses\r\nwith a hundred acres of land attached to each, and promised to advance\r\nthe sums required to pay for clearing the ground, for seeds, ploughing\r\ngear, and cattle, and for making occupation roads.\r\n\r\n“I myself also started two farms, quite as much for the sake of bringing\r\nmy waste land into cultivation as with a view to giving an object-lesson\r\nin the use of modern methods in agriculture. In six weeks’ time the\r\npopulation of the town increased to three hundred people. Homes for\r\nseveral families must be built on the six farms; there was a vast\r\nquantity of land to be broken up; the work called for laborers.\r\nWheelwrights, drainmakers, journeymen, and laborers of all kinds flocked\r\nin. The road to Grenoble was covered with carts that came and went. All\r\nthe countryside was astir. The circulation of money had made every one\r\nanxious to earn it, apathy had ceased, the place had awakened.\r\n\r\n“The story of M. Gravier, one of those who did so much for this canton,\r\ncan be concluded in a few words. In spite of cautious misgivings, not\r\nunnatural in a man occupying an official position in a provincial\r\ntown, he advanced more than forty thousand francs, on the faith of my\r\npromises, without knowing whether he should ever see them back again.\r\nTo-day every one of his farms is let for a thousand francs. His tenants\r\nhave thriven so well that each of them owns at least a hundred acres,\r\nthree hundred sheep, twenty cows, ten oxen, and five horses, and employs\r\nmore than twenty persons.\r\n\r\n“But to resume. Our farms were ready by the end of the fourth year. Our\r\nwheat harvest seemed miraculous to the people in the district, heavy as\r\nthe first crop off the land ought to be. How often during that year\r\nI trembled for the success of my work! Rain or drought might spoil\r\neverything by diminishing the belief in me that was already felt. When\r\nwe began to grow wheat, it necessitated the mill that you have seen,\r\nwhich brings me in about five hundred francs a year. So the peasants say\r\nthat ‘there is luck about me’ (that is the way they put it), and believe\r\nin me as they believe in their relics. These new undertakings--the\r\nfarms, the mill, the plantations, and the roads--have given employment\r\nto all the various kinds of workers whom I had called in. Although the\r\nbuildings fully represent the value of the sixty thousand francs\r\nof capital, which we sunk in the district, the outlay was more\r\nthan returned to us by the profits on the sales which the consumers\r\noccasioned. I never ceased my efforts to put vigor into this industrial\r\nlife which was just beginning. A nurseryman took my advice and came\r\nto settle in the place, and I preached wholesome doctrine to the poor\r\nconcerning the planting of fruit trees, in order that some day they\r\nshould obtain a monopoly of the sale of fruit in Grenoble.\r\n\r\n“‘You take your cheeses there as it is,’ I used to tell them, ‘why not\r\ntake poultry, eggs, vegetables, game, hay and straw, and so forth?’ All\r\nmy counsels were a source of fortune; it was a question of who should\r\nfollow them first. A number of little businesses were started; they went\r\non at first but slowly, but from day to day their progress became more\r\nrapid; and now sixty carts full of the various products of the district\r\nset out every Monday for Grenoble, and there is more buckwheat grown for\r\npoultry food than they used to sow for human consumption. The trade in\r\ntimber grew to be so considerable that it was subdivided, and since\r\nthe fourth year of our industrial era, we have had dealers in firewood,\r\nsquared timber, planks, bark, and later on, in charcoal. In the end four\r\nnew sawmills were set up, to turn out the planks and beams of timber.\r\n\r\n“When the ex-mayor had acquired a few business notions, he felt the\r\nnecessity of learning to read and write. He compared the prices that\r\nwere asked for wood in various neighborhoods, and found such differences\r\nin his favor, that he secured new customers in one place after another,\r\nand now a third of the trade in the department passes through his\r\nhands. There has been such a sudden increase in our traffic that we find\r\nconstant work for three wagon-builders and two harness-makers, each of\r\nthem employing three hands at least. Lastly, the quantity of ironware\r\nthat we use is so large that an agricultural implement and tool-maker\r\nhas removed into the town, and is very well satisfied with the result.\r\n\r\n“The desire of gain develops a spirit of ambition, which has ever since\r\nimpelled our workers to extend their field from the township to the\r\ncanton, and from the canton to the department, so as to increase their\r\nprofits by increasing their sales. I had only to say a word to point out\r\nnew openings to them, and their own sense did the rest. Four years had\r\nbeen sufficient to change the face of the township. When I had come\r\nthrough it first, I did not catch the slightest sound; but in less than\r\nfive years from that time, there was life and bustle everywhere. The gay\r\nsongs, the shrill or murmuring sounds made by the tools in the workshops\r\nrang pleasantly in my ears. I watched the comings and goings of a busy\r\npopulation congregated in the clean and wholesome new town, where plenty\r\nof trees had been planted. Every one of them seemed conscious of a happy\r\nlot, every face shone with the content that comes through a life of\r\nuseful toil.\r\n\r\n“I look upon these five years as the first epoch of prosperity in the\r\nhistory of our town,” the doctor went on after a pause. “During that\r\ntime I have prepared the ground and sowed the seed in men’s minds as\r\nwell as in the land. Henceforward industrial progress could not be\r\nstayed, the population was bound to go forward. A second epoch was\r\nabout to begin. This little world very soon desired to be better clad. A\r\nshoemaker came, and with him a haberdasher, a tailor, and a hatter. This\r\ndawn of luxury brought us a butcher and a grocer, and a midwife, who\r\nbecame very necessary to me, for I lost a great deal of time over\r\nmaternity cases. The stubbed wastes yielded excellent harvests, and the\r\nsuperior quality of our agricultural produce was maintained through\r\nthe increased supply of manure. My enterprise could now develop itself;\r\neverything followed on quite naturally.\r\n\r\n“When the houses had been rendered wholesome, and their inmates\r\ngradually persuaded to feed and clothe themselves better, I wanted the\r\ndumb animals to feel the benefit of these beginnings of civilization.\r\nAll the excellence of cattle, whether as a race or as individuals, and,\r\nin consequence, the quality of the milk and meat, depends upon the care\r\nthat is expended upon them. I took the sanitation of cowsheds for the\r\ntext of my sermons. I showed them how an animal that is properly housed\r\nand well cared for is more profitable than a lean neglected beast, and\r\nthe comparison wrought a gradual change for the better in the lot of\r\nthe cattle in the Commune. Not one of them was ill treated. The cows\r\nand oxen were rubbed down as in Switzerland and Auvergne. Sheep-folds,\r\nstables, byres, dairies, and barns were rebuilt after the pattern of\r\nthe roomy, well-ventilated, and consequently healthy steadings that M.\r\nGravier and I had constructed. Our tenants became my apostles. They\r\nmade rapid converts of unbelievers, demonstrating the soundness of my\r\ndoctrines by their prompt results. I lent money to those who needed it,\r\ngiving the preference to hardworking poor people, because they served as\r\nan example. Any unsound or sickly cattle or beasts of poor quality were\r\nquickly disposed of by my advice, and replaced by fine specimens. In\r\nthis way our dairy produce came, in time, to command higher prices in\r\nthe market than that sent by other communes. We had splendid herds, and\r\nas a consequence, capital leather.\r\n\r\n“This step forward was of great importance, and in this wise. In rural\r\neconomy nothing can be regarded as trifling. Our hides used to fetch\r\nscarcely anything, and the leather we made was of little value, but\r\nwhen once our leather and hides were improved, tanneries were easily\r\nestablished along the waterside. We became tanners, and business rapidly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n“Wine, properly speaking, had been hitherto unknown; a thin, sour\r\nbeverage like verjuice had been their only drink, but now wineshops were\r\nestablished to supply a natural demand. The oldest tavern was enlarged\r\nand transformed into an inn, which furnished mules to pilgrims to the\r\nGrand Chartreuse who began to come our way, and after two years there\r\nwas just enough business for two innkeepers.\r\n\r\n“The justice of the peace died just as our second prosperous epoch\r\nbegan, and luckily for us, his successor had formerly been a notary in\r\nGrenoble who had lost most of his fortune by a bad speculation, though\r\nenough of it yet remained to cause him to be looked upon in the village\r\nas a wealthy man. It was M. Gravier who induced him to settle among\r\nus. He built himself a comfortable house and helped me by uniting his\r\nefforts to mine. He also laid out a farm, and broke up and cleaned some\r\nof the waste land, and at this moment he has three chalets up above on\r\nthe mountain side. He has a large family. He dismissed the old registrar\r\nand the clerk, and in their place installed better-educated men, who\r\nworked far harder, moreover, than their predecessors had done. One\r\nof the heads of these two new households started a distillery of\r\npotato-spirit, and the other was a wool-washer; each combined these\r\noccupations with his official work, and in this way two valuable\r\nindustries were created among us.\r\n\r\n“Now that the Commune had some revenues of its own, no opposition was\r\nraised in any quarter when they were spent on building a town-hall, with\r\na free school for elementary education in the building and accommodation\r\nfor a teacher. For this important post I had selected a poor priest who\r\nhad taken the oath, and had therefore been cast out by the department,\r\nand who at last found a refuge among us for his old age. The\r\nschoolmistress is a very worthy woman who had lost all that she had, and\r\nwas in great distress. We made up a nice little sum for her, and she\r\nhas just opened a boarding-school for girls to which the wealthy farmers\r\nhereabouts are beginning to send their daughters.\r\n\r\n“If so far, sir, I have been entitled to tell you the story of my own\r\ndoings as the chronicle of this little spot of earth, I have reached\r\nthe point where M. Janvier, the new parson, began to divide the work of\r\nregeneration with me. He has been a second Fenelon, unknown beyond the\r\nnarrow limits of a country parish, and by some secret of his own has\r\ninfused a spirit of brotherliness and of charity among these folk that\r\nhas made them almost like one large family. M. Dufau, the justice of\r\nthe peace, was a late comer, but he in an equal degree deserves the\r\ngratitude of the people here.\r\n\r\n“I will put the whole position before you in figures that will make\r\nit clearer than any words of mine. At this moment the Commune owns two\r\nhundred acres of woodland, and a hundred and sixty acres of meadow.\r\nWithout running up the rates, we give a hundred crowns to supplement the\r\ncure’s stipend, we pay two hundred francs to the rural policeman, and\r\nas much again to the schoolmaster and schoolmistress. The maintenance of\r\nthe roads costs us five hundred francs, while necessary repairs to the\r\ntownhall, the parsonage, and the church, with some few other expenses,\r\nalso amount to a similar sum. In fifteen years’ time there will be a\r\nthousand francs worth of wood to fell for every hundred francs’ worth\r\ncut now, and the taxes will not cost the inhabitants a penny. This\r\nCommune is bound to become one of the richest in France. But perhaps I\r\nam taxing your patience, sir?” said Benassis, suddenly discovering that\r\nhis companion wore such a pensive expression that it seemed as though\r\nhis attention was wandering.\r\n\r\n“No! no!” answered the commandant.\r\n\r\n“Our trade, handicrafts, and agriculture so far only supplied the needs\r\nof the district,” the doctor went on. “At a certain point our prosperity\r\ncame to a standstill. I wanted a post-office, and sellers of tobacco,\r\nstationery, powder and shot. The receiver of taxes had hitherto\r\npreferred to live elsewhere, but now I succeeded in persuading him\r\nto take up his abode in the town, holding out as inducements the\r\npleasantness of the place and of the new society. As time and place\r\npermitted I had succeeded in producing a supply of everything for which\r\nI had first created a need, in attracting families of hardworking people\r\ninto the district, and in implanting a desire to own land in them all.\r\nSo by degrees, as they saved a little money, the waste land began to\r\nbe broken up; spade husbandry and small holdings increased; so did the\r\nvalue of property on the mountain.\r\n\r\n“Those struggling folk who, when I knew them first, used to walk over\r\nto Grenoble carrying their few cheeses for sale, now made the journey\r\ncomfortably in a cart, and took fruit, eggs, chickens and turkeys, and\r\nbefore they were aware of it, everyone was a little richer. Even those\r\nwho came off worst had a garden at any rate, and grew early vegetables\r\nand fruit. It became the children’s work to watch the cattle in the\r\nfields, and at last it was found to be a waste of time to bake bread at\r\nhome. Here were signs of prosperity!\r\n\r\n“But if this place was to be a permanent forge of industry, fuel must\r\nbe constantly added to the fire. The town had not as yet a renascent\r\nindustry which could maintain this commercial process, an industry which\r\nshould make great transactions, a warehouse, and a market necessary. It\r\nis not enough that a country should lose none of the money that forms\r\nits capital; you will not increase its prosperity by more or less\r\ningenious devices for causing this amount to circulate, by means of\r\nproduction and consumption, through the greatest possible number of\r\nhands. That is not where your problem lies. When a country is fully\r\ndeveloped and its production keeps pace with its consumption, if private\r\nwealth is to increase as well as the wealth of the community at large,\r\nthere must be exchanges with other communities, which will keep a\r\nbalance on the right side of the balance-sheet. This thought has let\r\nstates with a limited territorial basis like Tyre, Carthage, Venice,\r\nHolland, and England, for instance, to secure the carrying trade. I cast\r\nabout for some such notion as this to apply to our little world, so as\r\nto inaugurate a third commercial epoch. Our town is so much like any\r\nother, that our prosperity was scarcely visible to a passing stranger;\r\nit was only for me that it was astonishing. The folk had come together\r\nby degrees; they themselves were a part of the change, and could not\r\njudge of its effects as a whole.\r\n\r\n“Seven years had gone by when I met with two strangers, the real\r\nbenefactors of the place, which perhaps some day they will transform\r\ninto a large town. One of them is a Tyrolese, an exceedingly clever\r\nfellow, who makes rough shoes for country people’s wear, and boots for\r\npeople of fashion in Grenoble as no one can make them, not even in Paris\r\nitself. He was a poor strolling musician, who, singing and working, had\r\nmade his way through Italy; one of those busy Germans who fashion the\r\ntools of their own work, and make the instrument that they play upon.\r\nWhen he came to the town he asked if any one wanted a pair of shoes.\r\nThey sent him to me, and I gave him an order for two pairs of boots, for\r\nwhich he made his own lasts. The foreigner’s skill surprised me. He gave\r\naccurate and consistent answers to the questions I put, and his face and\r\nmanner confirmed the good opinion I had formed of him. I suggested that\r\nhe should settle in the place, undertaking to assist him in business in\r\nevery way that I could; in fact, I put a fairly large sum of money at\r\nhis disposal. He accepted my offer. I had my own ideas in this. The\r\nquality of our leather had improved; and why should we not use it\r\nourselves, and before very long make our own shoes at moderate prices?\r\n\r\n“It was the basket-maker’s business over again on a larger scale. Chance\r\nhad put an exceedingly clever hard-working man in my way, and he must\r\nbe retained so that a steady and profitable trade might be given to\r\nthe place. There is a constant demand for foot-gear, and a very slight\r\ndifference in price is felt at once by the purchaser.\r\n\r\n“This was my reasoning, sir, and fortunately events have justified it.\r\nAt this time we have five tanyards, each of which has its bark-mill.\r\nThey take all the hides produced in the department itself, and even\r\ndraw part of their supply from Provence; and yet the Tyrolese uses more\r\nleather than they can produce, and has forty work-people in his employ!\r\n\r\n“I happened on the other man after a fashion no whit less strange, but\r\nyou might find the story tedious. He is just an ordinary peasant, who\r\ndiscovered a cheaper way of making the great broad-brimmed hats that are\r\nworn in this part of the world. He sells them in other cantons, and even\r\nsends them into Switzerland and Savoy. So long as the quality and the\r\nlow prices can be maintained, here are two inexhaustible sources\r\nof wealth for the canton, which suggested to my mind the idea of\r\nestablishing three fairs in the year. The prefect, amazed at our\r\nindustrial progress, lent his aid in obtaining the royal ordinance which\r\nauthorized them, and last year we held our three fairs. They are known\r\nas far as Savoy as the Shoe Fair and the Hat Fair.\r\n\r\n“The head clerk of a notary in Grenoble heard of these changes. He was\r\npoor, but he was a well-educated, hardworking young fellow, and Mlle.\r\nGravier was engaged to be married to him. He went to Paris to ask for an\r\nauthorization to establish himself here as a notary, and his request was\r\ngranted. As he had not to pay for his appointment, he could afford to\r\nbuild a house in the market square of the new town, opposite the\r\nhouse of the justice of the peace. We have a market once a week, and a\r\nconsiderable amount of business is transacted in corn and cattle.\r\n\r\n“Next year a druggist surely ought to come among us, and next we want a\r\nclockmaker, a furniture dealer, and a bookseller; and so, by degrees,\r\nwe shall have all the desirable luxuries of life. Who knows but that at\r\nlast we shall have a number of substantial houses, and give ourselves\r\nall the airs of a small city? Education has made such strides that there\r\nhas never been any opposition made at the council-board when I proposed\r\nthat we should restore our church and build a parsonage; nor when I\r\nbrought forward a plan for laying out a fine open space, planted with\r\ntrees, where the fairs could be held, and a further scheme for a\r\nsurvey of the township, so that its future streets should be wholesome,\r\nspacious, and wisely planned.\r\n\r\n“This is how we came to have nineteen hundred hearths in the place of a\r\nhundred and thirty-seven; three thousand head of cattle instead of\r\neight hundred; and for a population of seven hundred, no less than two\r\nthousand persons are living in the township, or three thousand, if the\r\npeople down the valley are included. There are twelve houses belonging\r\nto wealthy people in the Commune, there are a hundred well-to-do\r\nfamilies, and two hundred more which are thriving. The rest have their\r\nown exertions to look to. Every one knows how to read and write, and we\r\nsubscribe to seventeen different newspapers.\r\n\r\n“We have poor people still among us--there are far too many of them, in\r\nfact; but we have no beggars, and there is work enough for all. I have\r\nso many patients that my daily round taxes the powers of two horses. I\r\ncan go anywhere for five miles round at any hour without fear; for if\r\nany one was minded to fire a shot at me, his life would not be worth\r\nten minutes’ purchase. The undemonstrative affection of the people is\r\nmy sole gain from all these changes, except the radiant ‘Good-day, M.\r\nBenassis,’ that every one gives me as I pass. You will understand, of\r\ncourse, that the wealth incidentally acquired through my model farms has\r\nonly been a means and not an end.”\r\n\r\n“If every one followed your example in other places, sir, France would\r\nbe great indeed, and might laugh at the rest of Europe!” cried Genestas\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“But I have kept you out here for half an hour,” said Benassis; “it is\r\ngrowing dark, let us go in to dinner.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s house, on the side facing the garden, consists of a ground\r\nfloor and a single story, with a row of five windows in each, dormer\r\nwindows also project from the tiled mansard-roof. The green-painted\r\nshutters are in startling contrast with the gray tones of the walls.\r\nA vine wanders along the whole side of the house, a pleasant strip of\r\ngreen like a frieze, between the two stories. A few struggling Bengal\r\nroses make shift to live as best they may, half drowned at times by the\r\ndrippings from the gutterless eaves.\r\n\r\nAs you enter the large vestibule, the salon lies to your right; it\r\ncontains four windows, two of which look into the yard, and two into the\r\ngarden. Ceiling and wainscot are paneled, and the walls are hung with\r\nseventeenth century tapestry--pathetic evidence that the room had been\r\nthe object of the late owner’s aspiration, and that he had lavished all\r\nthat he could spare upon it. The great roomy armchairs, covered with\r\nbrocaded damask; the old fashioned, gilded candle-sconces above the\r\nchimney-piece, and the window curtains with their heavy tassels, showed\r\nthat the cure had been a wealthy man. Benassis had made some additions\r\nto this furniture, which was not without a character of its own. He\r\nhad placed two smaller tables, decorated with carved wooden garlands,\r\nbetween the windows on opposite sides of the room, and had put a clock,\r\nin a case of tortoise shell, inlaid with copper, upon the mantel-shelf.\r\nThe doctor seldom occupied the salon; its atmosphere was damp and close,\r\nlike that of a room that is always kept shut. Memories of the dead cure\r\nstill lingered about it; the peculiar scent of his tobacco seemed to\r\npervade the corner by the hearth where he had been wont to sit. The\r\ntwo great easy-chairs were symmetrically arranged on either side of the\r\nfire, which had not been lighted since the time of M. Gravier’s visit;\r\nthe bright flames from the pine logs lighted the room.\r\n\r\n“The evenings are chilly even now,” said Benassis; “it is pleasant to\r\nsee a fire.”\r\n\r\nGenestas was meditating. He was beginning to understand the doctor’s\r\nindifference to his every-day surroundings.\r\n\r\n“It is surprising to me, sir, that you, who possess real public\r\nspirit, should have made no effort to enlighten the Government, after\r\naccomplishing so much.”\r\n\r\nBenassis began to laugh, but without bitterness; he said, rather sadly:\r\n\r\n“You mean that I should draw up some sort of memorial on various ways of\r\ncivilizing France? You are not the first to suggest it, sir; M. Gravier\r\nhas forestalled you. Unluckily, Governments cannot be enlightened, and a\r\nGovernment which regards itself as a diffuser of light is the least open\r\nto enlightenment. What we have done for our canton, every mayor ought,\r\nof course, to do for his; the magistrate should work for his town, the\r\nsub-prefect for his district, the prefect for the department, and the\r\nminister for France, each acting in his own sphere of interest. For the\r\nfew miles of country road that I persuaded our people to make,\r\nanother would succeed in constructing a canal or a highway; and for\r\nmy encouragement of the peasants’ trade in hats, a minister would\r\nemancipate France from the industrial yoke of the foreigner by\r\nencouraging the manufacture of clocks in different places, by helping to\r\nbring to perfection our iron and steel, our tools and appliances, or by\r\nbringing silk or dyer’s woad into cultivation.\r\n\r\n“In commerce, ‘encouragement,’ does not mean protection. A really wise\r\npolicy should aim at making a country independent of foreign supply,\r\nbut this should be effected without resorting to the pitiful shifts\r\nof customs duties and prohibitions. Industries must work out their own\r\nsalvation, competition is the life of trade. A protected industry goes\r\nto sleep, and monopoly, like the protective tariff, kills it outright.\r\nThe country upon which all others depend for their supplies will be the\r\nland which will promulgate free trade, for it will be conscious of its\r\npower to produce its manufactures at prices lower than those of any of\r\nits competitors. France is in a better position to attain this end than\r\nEngland, for France alone possesses an amount of territory sufficiently\r\nextensive to maintain a supply of agricultural produce at prices that\r\nwill enable the worker to live on low wages; the Administration should\r\nkeep this end in view, for therein lies the whole modern question. I\r\nhave not devoted my life to this study, dear sir; I found my work by\r\naccident, and late in the day. Such simple things as these are too\r\nslight, moreover, to build into a system; there is nothing wonderful\r\nabout them, they do not lend themselves to theories; it is their\r\nmisfortune to be merely practically useful. And then work cannot be done\r\nquickly. The man who means to succeed in these ways must daily look to\r\nfind within himself the stock of courage needed for the day, a courage\r\nin reality of the rarest kind, though it does not seem hard to practise,\r\nand meets with little recognition--the courage of the schoolmaster, who\r\nmust say the same things over and over again. We all honor the man who\r\nhas shed his blood on the battlefield, as you have done; but we ridicule\r\nthis other whose life-fire is slowly consumed in repeating the same\r\nwords to children of the same age. There is no attraction for any of us\r\nin obscure well-doing. We know nothing of the civic virtue that led the\r\ngreat men of ancient times to serve their country in the lowest rank\r\nwhenever they did not command. Our age is afflicted with a disease that\r\nmakes each of us seek to rise above his fellows, and there are more\r\nsaints than shrines among us.\r\n\r\n“This is how it has come to pass. The monarchy fell, and we lost Honor,\r\nChristian Virtue faded with the religion of our forefathers, and our own\r\nineffectual attempts at government have destroyed Patriotism. Ideas can\r\nnever utterly perish, so these beliefs linger on in our midst, but\r\nthey do not influence the great mass of the people, and Society has no\r\nsupport but Egoism. Every individual believes in himself. For us the\r\nfuture means egoism; further than that we cannot see. The great man who\r\nshall save us from the shipwreck which is imminent will no doubt avail\r\nhimself of individualism when he makes a nation of us once more; but\r\nuntil this regeneration comes, we bide our time in a materialistic and\r\nutilitarian age. Utilitarianism--to this conclusion we have come. We\r\nare all rated, not at our just worth, but according to our social\r\nimportance. People will scarcely look at an energetic man if he is\r\nin shirt-sleeves. The Government itself is pervaded by this idea. A\r\nminister sends a paltry medal to a sailor who has saved a dozen lives\r\nat the risk of his own, while the deputy who sells his vote to those in\r\npower receives the Cross of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n“Woe to a people made up of such men as these! For nations, like men,\r\nowe all the strength and vitality that is in them to noble thoughts\r\nand aspirations, and men’s feelings shape their faith. But when\r\nself-interest has taken the place of faith and each one of us thinks\r\nonly of himself, and believes in himself alone, how can you expect to\r\nfind among us much of that civil courage whose very essence consists in\r\nself-renunciation? The same principle underlies both military and civil\r\ncourage, although you soldiers are called upon to yield your lives up\r\nonce and for all, while ours are given slowly drop by drop, and the\r\nbattle is the same for both, although it takes different forms.\r\n\r\n“The man who would fain civilize the lowliest spot on earth needs\r\nsomething besides wealth for the task. Knowledge is still more\r\nnecessary; and knowledge, and patriotism, and integrity are worthless\r\nunless they are accompanied by a firm determination on his part to set\r\nhis own personal interests completely aside, and to devote himself to a\r\nsocial idea. France, no doubt, possesses more than one well-educated\r\nman and more than one patriot in every commune; but I am fully\r\npersuaded that not every canton can produce a man who to these valuable\r\nqualifications unites the unflagging will and pertinacity with which a\r\nblacksmith hammers out iron.\r\n\r\n“The Destroyer and the Builder are two manifestations of Will; the one\r\nprepares the way, and the other accomplishes the work; the first appears\r\nin the guise of a spirit of evil, and the second seems like the spirit\r\nof good. Glory falls to the Destroyer, while the Builder is forgotten;\r\nfor evil makes a noise in the world that rouses little souls to\r\nadmiration, while good deeds are slow to make themselves heard.\r\nSelf-love leads us to prefer the more conspicuous part. If it should\r\nhappen that any public work is undertaken without an interested motive,\r\nit will only be by accident, until the day when education has changed\r\nour ways of regarding things in France.\r\n\r\n“Yet suppose that this change had come to pass, and that all of us\r\nwere public-spirited citizens; in spite of our comfortable lives among\r\ntrivialities, should we not be in a fair way to become the most wearied,\r\nwearisome, and unfortunate race of philistines under the sun?\r\n\r\n“I am not at the helm of State, the decision of great questions of this\r\nkind is not within my province; but, setting these considerations aside,\r\nthere are other difficulties in the way of laying down hard and fast\r\nrules as to government. In the matter of civilization, everything\r\nis relative. Ideas that suit one country admirably are fatal in\r\nanother--men’s minds are as various as the soils of the globe. If we\r\nhave so often been ill governed, it is because a faculty for government,\r\nlike taste, is the outcome of a very rare and lofty attitude of mind.\r\nThe qualifications for the work are found in a natural bent of the soul\r\nrather than in the possession of scientific formulae. No one need fear,\r\nhowever, to call himself a statesman, for his actions and motives cannot\r\nbe justly estimated; his real judges are far away, and the results of\r\nhis deeds are even more remote. We have a great respect here in France\r\nfor men of ideas--a keen intellect exerts a great attraction for us;\r\nbut ideas are of little value where a resolute will is the one thing\r\nneedful. Administration, as a matter of fact, does not consist in\r\nforcing more or less wise methods and ideas upon the great mass of\r\nthe nation, but in giving to the ideas, good or bad, that they already\r\npossess a practical turn which will make them conduce to the general\r\nwelfare of the State. If old-established prejudices and customs bring a\r\ncountry into a bad way, the people will renounce their errors of their\r\nown accord. Are not losses the result of economical errors of every\r\nkind? And is it not, therefore, to every one’s interest to rectify them\r\nin the long run?\r\n\r\n“Luckily I found a _tabula rasa_ in this district. They have followed my\r\nadvice, and the land is well cultivated; but there had been no previous\r\nerrors in agriculture, and the soil was good to begin with, so that it\r\nhas been easy to introduce the five-ply shift, artificial grasses,\r\nand potatoes. My methods did not clash with people’s prejudices. The\r\nfaultily constructed plowshares in use in some parts of France were\r\nunknown here, the hoe sufficed for the little field work that they did.\r\nOur wheelwright extolled my wheeled plows because he wished to increase\r\nhis own business, so I secured an ally in him; but in this matter, as in\r\nall others, I sought to make the good of one conduce to the good of all.\r\n\r\n“Then I turned my attention to another kind of production, that should\r\nincrease the welfare rather than the wealth of these poor folk. I\r\nhave brought nothing from without into this district; I have simply\r\nencouraged the people to seek beyond its limits for a market for their\r\nproduce, a measure that could not but increase their prosperity in a\r\nway that they felt immediately. They had no idea of the fact, but they\r\nthemselves were my apostles, and their works preached my doctrines.\r\nSomething else must also be borne in mind. We are barely five leagues\r\nfrom Grenoble. There is plenty of demand in a large city for produce of\r\nall kinds, but not every commune is situated at the gates of a city. In\r\nevery similar undertaking the nature, situation, and resources of the\r\ncountry must be taken into consideration, and a careful study must be\r\nmade of the soil, of the people themselves, and of many other things;\r\nand no one should expect to have vines grow in Normandy. So no tasks\r\ncan be more various than those of government, and its general principles\r\nmust be few in number. The law is uniform, but not so the land and the\r\nminds and customs of those who dwell in it; and the administration of\r\nthe law is the art of carrying it out in such a manner that no injury is\r\ndone to people’s interests. Every place must be considered separately.\r\n\r\n“On the other side of the mountain at the foot of which our deserted\r\nvillage lies, they find it impossible to use wheeled plows, because the\r\nsoil is not deep enough. Now if the mayor of the commune were to take\r\nit into his head to follow in our footsteps, he would be the ruin of\r\nhis neighborhood. I advised him to plant vineyards; they had a capital\r\nvintage last year in the little district, and their wine is exchanged\r\nfor our corn.\r\n\r\n“Then, lastly, it must be remembered that my words carried a certain\r\nweight with the people to whom I preached, and that we were continually\r\nbrought into close contact. I cured my peasants’ complaints; an easy\r\ntask, for a nourishing diet is, as a rule, all that is needed to restore\r\nthem to health and strength. Either through thrift, or through sheer\r\npoverty, the country people starve themselves; any illness among them is\r\ncaused in this way, and as a rule they enjoy very fair health.\r\n\r\n“When I first decided to devote myself to this life of obscure\r\nrenunciation, I was in doubt for a long while whether to become a cure,\r\na country doctor, or a justice of the peace. It is not without reason\r\nthat people speak collectively of the priest, the lawyer, and the doctor\r\nas ‘men of the black robe’--so the saying goes. They represent the three\r\nprincipal elements necessary to the existence of society--conscience,\r\nproperty, and health. At one time the first, and at a later period the\r\nsecond, was all-important in the State. Our predecessors on this earth\r\nthought, perhaps not without reason, that the priest, who prescribed\r\nwhat men should think, ought to be paramount; so the priest was king,\r\npontiff, and judge in one, for in those days belief and faith were\r\neverything. All this has been changed in our day; and we must even take\r\nour epoch as we find it. But I, for one, believe that the progress of\r\ncivilization and the welfare of the people depend on these three men.\r\nThey are the three powers who bring home to the people’s minds the ways\r\nin which facts, interests, and principles affect them. They themselves\r\nare three great results produced in the midst of the nation by the\r\noperation of events, by the ownership of property, and by the growth of\r\nideas. Time goes on and brings changes to pass, property increases or\r\ndiminishes in men’s hands, all the various readjustments have to be duly\r\nregulated, and in this way principles of social order are established.\r\nIf civilization is to spread itself, and production is to be increased,\r\nthe people must be made to understand the way in which the interests\r\nof the individual harmonize with national interests which resolve\r\nthemselves into facts, interests, and principles. As these three\r\nprofessions are bound to deal with these issues of human life, it seemed\r\nto me that they must be the most powerful civilizing agencies of our\r\ntime. They alone afford to a man of wealth the opportunity of mitigating\r\nthe fate of the poor, with whom they daily bring him in contact.\r\n\r\n“The peasant is always more willing to listen to the man who lays down\r\nrules for saving him from bodily ills than to the priest who exhorts him\r\nto save his soul. The first speaker can talk of this earth, the scene\r\nof the peasant’s labors, while the priest is bound to talk to him of\r\nheaven, with which, unfortunately, the peasant nowadays concerns himself\r\nvery little indeed; I say unfortunately, because the doctrine of a\r\nfuture life is not only a consolation, but a means by which men may be\r\ngoverned. Is not religion the one power that sanctions social laws? We\r\nhave but lately vindicated the existence of God. In the absence of a\r\nreligion, the Government was driven to invent the Terror, in order to\r\ncarry its laws into effect; but the terror was the fear of man, and it\r\nhas passed away.\r\n\r\n“When a peasant is ill, when he is forced to lie on his pallet, and\r\nwhile he is recovering, he cannot help himself, he is forced to listen\r\nto logical reasoning, which he can understand quite well if it is put\r\nclearly before him. This thought made a doctor of me. My calculations\r\nfor the peasants were made along with them. I never gave advice unless\r\nI was quite sure of the results, and in this way compelled them to admit\r\nthe wisdom of my views. The people require infallibility. Infallibility\r\nwas the making of Napoleon; he would have been a god if he had not\r\nfilled the world with the sound of his fall at Waterloo. If Mahomet\r\nfounded a permanent religion after conquering the third part of the\r\nglobe, it was by dint of concealing his deathbed from the crowd. The\r\nsame rules hold good for the great conqueror and for the provincial\r\nmayor, and a nation or a commune is much the same sort of crowd; indeed,\r\nthe great multitude of mankind is the same everywhere.\r\n\r\n“I have been exceedingly firm with those whom I have helped with money;\r\nif I had not been inflexible on this point, they all would have laughed\r\nat me. Peasants, no less than worldlings, end by despising the man that\r\nthey can deceive. He has been cheated? Clearly, then, he must have been\r\nweak; and it is might alone that governs the world. I have never charged\r\na penny for my professional advice, except to those who were evidently\r\nrich people; but I have not allowed the value of my services to be\r\noverlooked at all, and I always make them pay for medicine unless the\r\npatient is exceedingly poor. If my peasants do not pay me in money, they\r\nare quite aware that they are in my debt; sometimes they satisfy their\r\nconsciences by bringing oats for my horses, or corn, when it is cheap.\r\nBut if the miller were to send me some eels as a return for my advice,\r\nI should tell him that he is too generous for such a small matter. My\r\npoliteness bears fruit. In the winter I shall have some sacks of flour\r\nfor the poor. Ah! sir, they have kind hearts, these people, if one does\r\nnot slight them, and to-day I think more good and less evil of them than\r\nI did formerly.”\r\n\r\n“What a deal of trouble you have taken!” said Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” answered Benassis. “It was no more trouble to say\r\nsomething useful than to chatter about trifles; and whether I chatted\r\nor joked, the talk always turned on them and their concerns wherever\r\nI went. They would not listen to me at first. I had to overcome their\r\ndislikes; I belonged to the middle classes--that is to say, I was\r\na natural enemy. I found the struggle amusing. An easy or an uneasy\r\nconscience--that is all the difference that lies between doing well or\r\nill; the trouble is the same in either case. If scoundrels would but\r\nbehave themselves properly, they might be millionaires instead of being\r\nhanged. That is all.”\r\n\r\n“The dinner is growing cold, sir!” cried Jacquotte, in the doorway.\r\n\r\nGenestas caught the doctor’s arm.\r\n\r\n“I have only one comment to offer on what I have just heard,” he\r\nremarked. “I am not acquainted with any account of the wars of Mahomet,\r\nso that I can form no opinions as to his military talents; but if you\r\nhad only watched the Emperor’s tactics during the campaign in France,\r\nyou might well have taken him for a god; and if he was beaten on the\r\nfield of Waterloo, it was because he was more than mortal, it was\r\nbecause the earth found his weight too heavy to bear, and sprang from\r\nunder his feet! On every other subject I entirely agree with you, and\r\n_tonnerre de Dieu_! whoever hatched you did a good day’s work.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” exclaimed Benassis with a smile, “let us sit down to dinner.”\r\n\r\nThe walls of the dining-room were paneled from floor to ceiling, and\r\npainted gray. The furniture consisted of a few straw-bottomed chairs,\r\na sideboard, some cupboards, a stove, and the late owner’s celebrated\r\nclock; there were white curtains in the window, and a white cloth on the\r\ntable, about which there was no sign of luxury. The dinner service was\r\nof plain white earthenware; the soup, made after the traditions of the\r\nlate cure, was the most concentrated kind of broth that was ever set\r\nto simmer by any mortal cook. The doctor and his guest had scarcely\r\nfinished it when a man rushed into the kitchen, and in spite of\r\nJacquotte, suddenly invaded the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“It is this, sir. The mistress, our Mme. Vigneau, has turned as white as\r\nwhite can be, so that we are frightened about her.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, then,” Benassis said cheerfully, “I must leave the table,”\r\n and he rose to go.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the doctor’s entreaties, Genestas flung down his\r\ntable-napkin, and swore in a soldierly fashion that he would not finish\r\nhis dinner without his host. He returned indeed to the salon; and as he\r\nwarmed himself by the fire, he thought over the troubles that no man may\r\nescape, the troubles that are found in every lot that it falls to man to\r\nendure here upon earth.\r\n\r\nBenassis soon came back, and the two future friends sat down again.\r\n\r\n“Taboureau has just come up to speak to you,” said Jacquotte to her\r\nmaster, as she brought in the dishes that she had kept hot for them.\r\n\r\n“Who can be ill at his place?” asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n“No one is ill, sir. I think from what he said that it is some matter of\r\nhis own that he wants to ask you about; he is coming back again.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. This Taboureau,” Benassis went on, addressing Genestas, “is\r\nfor me a whole philosophical treatise; take a good look at him when\r\nhe comes, he is sure to amuse you. He was a laborer, a thrifty,\r\nhard-working man, eating little and getting through a good deal of\r\nwork. As soon as the rogue came to have a few crowns of his own, his\r\nintelligence began to develop; he watched the progress which I had\r\noriginated in this little district with an eye to his own profit. He had\r\nmade quite a fortune in eight year’s time, that is to say, a fortune\r\nfor our part of the world. Very likely he may have a couple of score\r\nthousand francs by now. But if I were to give you a thousand guesses,\r\nyou would never find out how he made the money. He is a usurer, and\r\nhis scheme of usury is so profoundly and so cleverly based upon the\r\nrequirements of the whole canton, that I should merely waste my time if\r\nI were to take it upon myself to undeceive them as to the benefits which\r\nthey reap, in their own opinion, from their dealings with Taboureau.\r\nWhen this devil of a fellow saw every one cultivating his own plot of\r\nground, he hurried about buying grain so as to supply the poor with the\r\nrequisite seed. Here, as everywhere else, the peasants and even some\r\nof the farmers had no ready money with which to pay for seed. To some,\r\nMaster Taboureau would lend a sack of barley, for which he was to\r\nreceive a sack of rye at harvest time, and to others a measure of wheat\r\nfor a sack of four. At the present day the man has extended this curious\r\nbusiness of his all over the department; and unless something happens to\r\nprevent him, he will go on and very likely make a million. Well, my\r\ndear sir, Taboureau the laborer, an obliging, hard-working, good-natured\r\nfellow, used to lend a helping hand to any one who asked him; but as\r\nhis gains have increased _Monsieur_ Taboureau has become litigious,\r\narrogant, and somewhat given to sharp practice. The more money he makes,\r\nthe worse he grows. The moment that the peasant forsakes his life\r\nof toil pure and simple for the leisured existence of the landowning\r\nclasses, he becomes intolerable. There is a certain kind of character,\r\npartly virtuous, partly vicious, half-educated, half-ignorant, which\r\nwill always be the despair of governments. You will see an example of it\r\nin Taboureau. He looks simple, and even doltish; but when his interests\r\nare in question, he is certainly profoundly clever.”\r\n\r\nA heavy footstep announced the approach of the grain lender.\r\n\r\n“Come in, Taboureau!” cried Benassis.\r\n\r\nThus forewarned by the doctor, the commandant scrutinized the peasant in\r\nthe doorway. Taboureau was decidedly thin, and stooped a little. He\r\nhad a bulging forehead, covered with wrinkles, and a cavernous face, in\r\nwhich two small gray eyes with a dark spot in either of them seemed to\r\nbe pierced rather than set. The lines of the miser’s mouth were close\r\nand firm, and his narrow chin turned up to meet an exaggeratedly\r\nhooked nose. His hair was turning gray already, and deep furrows which\r\nconverged above the prominent cheek-bones spoke of the wily shrewdness\r\nof a horse-dealer and of a life spent in journeying about. He wore a\r\nblue coat in fairly clean condition, the square side-pocket flaps stuck\r\nout above his hips, and the skirts of the coats hung loose in front,\r\nso that a white-flowered waistcoat was visible. There he stood firmly\r\nplanted on both feet, leaning upon a thick stick with a knob at the\r\nend of it. A little spaniel had followed the grain-dealer, in spite of\r\nJacquotte’s efforts, and was crouching beside him.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?” Benassis asked as he turned to this being.\r\n\r\nTaboureau gave a suspicious glance at the stranger seated at the\r\ndoctor’s table, and said:\r\n\r\n“It is not a case of illness, _M. le Maire_, but you understand how to\r\ndoctor the ailments of the purse just as well as those of the body. We\r\nhave had a little difficulty with a man over at Saint-Laurent, and I\r\nhave come to ask your advice about it.”\r\n\r\n“Why not see the justice of the peace or his clerk?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, because you are so much cleverer, sir, and I shall feel more sure\r\nabout my case if I can have your countenance.”\r\n\r\n“My good Taboureau, I am willing to give medical advice to the poor\r\nwithout charging for it; but I cannot look into the lawsuits of a\r\nman who is as wealthy as you are for nothing. It costs a good deal to\r\nacquire that kind of knowledge.”\r\n\r\nTaboureau began to twist his hat about.\r\n\r\n“If you want my advice, in order to save the hard coin you would have to\r\npay to the lawyer folk over in Grenoble, you must send a bag of rye to\r\nthe widow Martin, the woman who is bringing up the charity children.”\r\n\r\n“_Dame_! I will do it with all my heart, sir, if you think it necessary.\r\nCan I talk about this business of mine without troubling the gentleman\r\nthere?” he added, with a look at Genestas.\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded, so Taboureau went on.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, sir, two months ago a man from Saint-Laurent came over here\r\nto find me. ‘Taboureau,’ said he to me, ‘could you sell me a hundred and\r\nthirty-seven measures of barley?’ ‘Why not?’ say I, ‘that is my trade.\r\nDo you want it immediately?’ ‘No,’ he says, ‘I want it for the beginning\r\nof spring, in March.’ So far, so good. Well, we drive our bargain, and\r\nwe drink a glass, and we agree that he is to pay me the price that the\r\nbarley fetched at Grenoble last market day, and I am to deliver it\r\nin March. I am to warehouse it at owner’s risk, and no allowance for\r\nshrinkage of course. But barley goes up and up, my dear sir; the barley\r\nrises like boiling milk. Then I am hard up for money, and I sell my\r\nbarley. Quite natural, sir, was it not?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Benassis, “the barley had passed out of your possession, you\r\nwere only warehousing it. And suppose the barley had gone down in value,\r\nwould you not have compelled your buyer to take it at the price you\r\nagreed upon?”\r\n\r\n“But very likely he would not have paid me, sir. One must look out for\r\noneself! The seller ought to make a good profit when the chance comes in\r\nhis way; and, after, all the goods are not yours until you have paid for\r\nthem. That is so, _Monsieur l’Officier_, is it not? For you can see that\r\nthe gentleman has been in the army.”\r\n\r\n“Taboureau,” Benassis said sternly, “ill luck will come to you. Sooner\r\nor later God punishes ill deeds. How can you, knowing as much as you do,\r\na capable man moreover, and a man who conducts his business honorably,\r\nset examples of dishonesty to the canton? If you allow such proceedings\r\nas this to be taken against you, how can you expect that the poor will\r\nremain honest people and will not rob you? Your laborers will cheat\r\nyou out of part of their working hours, and every one here will be\r\ndemoralized. You are in the wrong. Your barley was as good as delivered.\r\nIf the man from Saint-Laurent had fetched it himself, you would not have\r\ngone there to take it away from him; you have sold something that was no\r\nlonger yours to sell, for your barley had already been turned into money\r\nwhich was to be paid down at the stipulated time. But go on.”\r\n\r\nGenestas gave the doctor a significant glance, to call his attention\r\nto Taboureau’s impassive countenance. Not a muscle had stirred in the\r\nusurer’s face during this reprimand; there was no flush on his forehead,\r\nand no sign of emotion in his little eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, I am called upon to supply the barley at last winter’s\r\nprice. Now _I_ consider that I am not bound to do so.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Taboureau, deliver that barley and be very quick about it,\r\nor make up your mind to be respected by nobody in the future. Even if\r\nyou gained the day in a case like this, you would be looked upon as\r\nan unscrupulous man who does not keep to his word, and is not bound by\r\npromises, or by honor, or----”\r\n\r\n“Go on, there is nothing to be afraid of; tell me that I am a scamp, a\r\nscoundrel, a thief outright. You can say things like that in business\r\nwithout insulting anybody, M. le Maire. ‘Tis each for himself in\r\nbusiness, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, why deliberately put yourself in a position in which you\r\ndeserve to be called by such names?”\r\n\r\n“But if the law is on my side, sir?”\r\n\r\n“But the law will certainly _not_ be on your side.”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure about it, sir? Certain sure? For you see it is an\r\nimportant matter.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I am. Quite sure. If I were not at dinner, I would have down\r\nthe code, and you should see for yourself. If the case comes on, you\r\nwill lose it, and you will never set foot in my house again, for I do\r\nnot wish to receive people whom I do not respect. Do you understand? You\r\nwill lose your case.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, not at all, I shall not lose it, sir,” said Taboureau. “You\r\nsee, sir, it is this way; it is the man from Saint-Laurent who owes _me_\r\nthe barley; I bought it of him, and now he refuses to deliver it. I just\r\nwanted to make quite certain that I should gain my case before going to\r\nany expense at court about it.”\r\n\r\nGenestas and the doctor exchanged glances; each concealed his amazement\r\nat the ingenious device by which the man had sought to learn the truth\r\nabout this point of law.\r\n\r\n“Very well, Taboureau, your man is a swindler; you should not make\r\nbargains with such people.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir, they understand business, those people do.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Taboureau.”\r\n\r\n“Your servant, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“Well, now,” remarked Benassis, when the usurer had gone, “if that\r\nfellow were in Paris, do you not think that he would be a millionaire\r\nbefore very long?”\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the doctor and his visitor went back to the salon, and\r\nall the rest of the evening until bedtime they talked about war and\r\npolitics; Genestas evincing a most violent dislike of the English in the\r\ncourse of conversation.\r\n\r\n“May I know whom I have the honor of entertaining as a guest?” asked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n“My name is Pierre Bluteau,” answered Genestas; “I am a captain\r\nstationed at Grenoble.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sir. Do you care to adopt M. Gravier’s plan? In the morning\r\nafter breakfast he liked to go on my rounds with me. I am not at all\r\nsure that you would find anything to interest you in the things that\r\noccupy me--they are so very commonplace. For, after all, you own no land\r\nabout here, nor are you the mayor of the place, and you will see nothing\r\nin the canton that you cannot see elsewhere; one thatched cottage is\r\njust like another. Still you will be in the open air, and you will have\r\nsomething to take you out of doors.”\r\n\r\n“No proposal could give me more pleasure. I did not venture to make it\r\nmyself, lest I should thrust myself upon you.”\r\n\r\nCommandant Genestas (who shall keep his own name in spite of the\r\nfictitious appellation which he had thought fit to give himself)\r\nfollowed his host to a room on the first floor above the salon.\r\n\r\n“That is right,” said Benassis, “Jacquotte has lighted a fire for you.\r\nIf you want anything, there is a bell-pull close to the head of the\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\n“I am not likely to want anything, however small, it seems to me,”\r\n exclaimed Genestas. “There is even a boot-jack. Only an old trooper\r\nknows what a boot-jack is worth! There are times, when one is out on a\r\ncampaign, sir, when one is ready to burn down a house to come by a knave\r\nof a boot-jack. After a few marches, one on the top of another, or above\r\nall, after an engagement, there are times when a swollen foot and the\r\nsoaked leather will not part company, pull as you will; I have had to\r\nlie down in my boots more than once. One can put up with the annoyance\r\nso long as one is by oneself.”\r\n\r\nThe commandant’s wink gave a kind of profound slyness to his last\r\nutterance; then he began to make a survey. Not without surprise, he saw\r\nthat the room was neatly kept, comfortable, and almost luxurious.\r\n\r\n“What splendor!” was his comment. “Your own room must be something\r\nwonderful.”\r\n\r\n“Come and see,” said the doctor; “I am your neighbor, there is nothing\r\nbut the staircase between us.”\r\n\r\nGenestas was again surprised when he entered the doctor’s room,\r\na bare-looking apartment with no adornment on the walls save an\r\nold-fashioned wall-paper of a yellowish tint with a pattern of brown\r\nroses over it; the color had gone in patches here and there. There was\r\na roughly painted iron bedstead, two gray cotton curtains were suspended\r\nfrom a wooden bracket above it, and a threadbare strip of carpet lay\r\nat the foot; it was like a bed in a hospital. By the bed-head stood a\r\nrickety cupboard on four feet with a door that continually rattled with\r\na sound like castanets. Three chairs and a couple of straw-bottomed\r\narmchairs stood about the room, and on a low chest of drawers in walnut\r\nwood stood a basin, and a ewer of obsolete pattern with a lid, which\r\nwas kept in place by a leaden rim round the top of the vessel. This\r\ncompleted the list of the furniture.\r\n\r\nThe grate was empty. All the apparatus required for shaving lay about in\r\nfront of an old mirror suspended above the painted stone chimney-piece\r\nby a bit of string. The floor was clean and carefully swept, but it was\r\nworn and splintered in various places, and there were hollows in it here\r\nand there. Gray cotton curtains bordered with a green fringe adorned the\r\ntwo windows. The scrupulous cleanliness maintained by Jacquotte gave a\r\ncertain air of distinction to this picture of simplicity, but everything\r\nin it, down to the round table littered with stray papers, and the very\r\npens on the writing-desk, gave the idea of an almost monastic life--a\r\nlife so wholly filled with thought and feeling of a wider kind that\r\noutward surroundings had come to be matters of no moment. An open door\r\nallowed the commandant to see the smaller room, which doubtless the\r\ndoctor seldom occupied. It was scarcely kept in the same condition as\r\nthe adjoining apartment; a few dusty books lay strewn about over the no\r\nless dusty shelves, and from the rows of labeled bottles it was easy to\r\nguess that the place was devoted rather to the dispensing of drugs than\r\nscientific studies.\r\n\r\n“Why this difference between your room and mine, you will ask?” said\r\nBenassis. “Listen a moment. I have always blushed for those who put\r\ntheir guests in the attics, who furnish them with mirrors that distort\r\neverything to such a degree that any one beholding himself might think\r\nthat he was smaller or larger than nature made him, or suffering from\r\napoplectic stroke or some other bad complaint. Ought we not to do our\r\nutmost to make a room as pleasant as possible during the time that\r\nour friend can be with us? Hospitality, to my thinking, is a virtue,\r\na pleasure, and a luxury; but in whatever light it is considered, nay,\r\neven if you regard it as a speculation, ought not our guest or our\r\nfriend to be made much of? Ought not every refinement of luxury to be\r\nreserved for him?\r\n\r\n“So the best furniture is put into your room, where a thick carpet is\r\nlaid down; there are hangings on the walls, and a clock and wax candles;\r\nand for you Jacquotte will do her best, she has no doubt brought\r\na night-light, and a pair of new slippers and some milk, and her\r\nwarming-pan too for your benefit. I hope that you will find that\r\nluxurious armchair the most comfortable seat you have ever sat in, it\r\nwas a discovery of the late cure’s; I do not know where he found it, but\r\nit is a fact that if you wish to meet with the perfection of comfort,\r\nbeauty, or convenience, you must ask counsel of the Church. Well, I hope\r\nthat you will find everything in your room to your liking. You will find\r\nsome good razors and excellent soap, and all the trifling details that\r\nmake one’s own home so pleasant. And if my views on the subject of\r\nhospitality should not at once explain the difference between your room\r\nand mine, to-morrow, M. Bluteau, you will arrive at a wonderfully clear\r\ncomprehension of the bareness of my room and the untidy condition of my\r\nstudy, when you see all the continual comings and goings here. Mine is\r\nnot an indoor life, to begin with. I am almost always out of the house,\r\nand if I stay at home, peasants come in at every moment to speak to\r\nme. My body and soul and house are all theirs. Why should I worry about\r\nsocial conventions in these matters, or trouble myself over the damage\r\nunintentionally done to floors and furniture by these worthy folk? Such\r\nthings cannot be helped. Luxury properly belongs to the boudoir and the\r\nguest-chamber, to great houses and chateaux. In short, as I scarcely do\r\nmore than sleep here, what do I want with superfluities of wealth? You\r\ndo not know, moreover, how little I care for anything in this world.”\r\n\r\nThey wished each other a friendly good-night with a warm shake of the\r\nhand, and went to bed. But before the commandant slept, he came to more\r\nthan one conclusion as to the man who hour by hour grew greater in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. A DOCTOR’S ROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing next morning Genestas went to the stable, drawn thither\r\nby the affection that every man feels for the horse that he rides.\r\nNicolle’s method of rubbing down the animal was quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\n“Up already, Commandant Bluteau?” cried Benassis, as he came upon his\r\nguest. “You hear the drum beat in the morning wherever you go, even in\r\nthe country! You are a regular soldier!”\r\n\r\n“Are you all right?” replied Genestas, holding out his hand with a\r\nfriendly gesture.\r\n\r\n“I am never really all right,” answered Benassis, half merrily, half\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n“Did you sleep well, sir?” inquired Jacquotte.\r\n\r\n“Faith, yes, my beauty; the bed as you made it was fit for a queen.”\r\n\r\nJacquotte’s face beamed as she followed her master and his guest,\r\nand when she had seen them seat themselves at table, she remarked to\r\nNicolle:\r\n\r\n“He is not a bad sort, after all, that officer gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure he is not, he has given me two francs already.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“We will begin to-day by calling at two places where there have been\r\ndeaths,” Benassis said to his visitor as they left the dining-room.\r\n“Although doctors seldom deign to confront their supposed victims, I\r\nwill take you round to the two houses, where you will be able to make\r\nsome interesting observations of human nature; and the scenes to which\r\nyou will be a witness will show you that in the expression of their\r\nfeelings our folk among the hills differ greatly from the dwellers in\r\nthe lowlands. Up among the mountain peaks in our canton they cling to\r\ncustoms that bear the impress of an older time, and that vaguely recall\r\nscenes in the Bible. Nature has traced out a line over our mountain\r\nranges; the whole appearance of the country is different on either side\r\nof it. You will find strength of character up above, flexibility and\r\nquickness below; they have larger ways of regarding things among the\r\nhills, while the bent of the lowlands is always towards the material\r\ninterests of existence. I have never seen a difference so strongly\r\nmarked, unless it has been in the Val d’Ajou, where the northern side is\r\npeopled by a tribe of idiots, and the southern by an intelligent race.\r\nThere is nothing but a stream in the valley bottom to separate these two\r\npopulations, which are utterly dissimilar in every respect, as different\r\nin face and stature as in manners, customs, and occupation. A fact\r\nof this kind should compel those who govern a country to make very\r\nextensive studies of local differences before passing laws that are to\r\naffect the great mass of the people. But the horses are ready, let us\r\nstart!”\r\n\r\nIn a short time the two horsemen reached a house in a part of the\r\ntownship that was overlooked by the mountains of the Grande Chartreuse.\r\nBefore the door of the dwelling, which was fairly clean and tidy, they\r\nsaw a coffin set upon two chairs, and covered with a black pall. Four\r\ntall candles stood about it, and on a stool near by there was a shallow\r\nbrass dish full of holy water, in which a branch of green box-wood was\r\nsteeping. Every passer-by went into the yard, knelt by the side of the\r\ndead, said a _Pater noster_, and sprinkled a few drops of holy water on\r\nthe bier. Above the black cloth that covered the coffin rose the green\r\nsprays of a jessamine that grew beside the doorway, and a twisted vine\r\nshoot, already in leaf, overran the lintel. Even the saddest ceremonies\r\ndemand that things shall appear to the best advantage, and in obedience\r\nto this vaguely-felt requirement a young girl had been sweeping the\r\nfront of the house. The dead man’s eldest son, a young peasant\r\nabout twenty-two years of age, stood motionless, leaning against the\r\ndoor-post. The tears in his eyes came and went without falling, or\r\nperhaps he furtively brushed them away. Benassis and Genestas saw\r\nall the details of this scene as they stood beyond the low wall; they\r\nfastened their horses to one of the row of poplar trees that grew along\r\nit, and entered the yard just as the widow came out of the byre. A woman\r\ncarrying a jug of milk was with her, and spoke.\r\n\r\n“Try to bear up bravely, my poor Pelletier,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear, after twenty-five years of life together, it is very hard\r\nto lose your man,” and her eyes brimmed over with tears. “Will you pay\r\nthe two sous?” she added, after a moment, as she held out her hand to\r\nher neighbor.\r\n\r\n“There, now! I had forgotten about it,” said the other woman, giving her\r\nthe coin. “Come, neighbor, don’t take on so. Ah! there is M. Benassis!”\r\n\r\n“Well, poor mother, how are you going on? A little better?” asked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n“_Dame_!” she said, as the tears fell fast, “we must go on, all the\r\nsame, that is certain. I tell myself that my man is out of pain now. He\r\nsuffered so terribly! But come inside, sir. Jacques, set some chairs for\r\nthese gentlemen. Come, stir yourself a bit. Lord bless you! if you were\r\nto stop there for a century, it would not bring your poor father back\r\nagain. And now, you will have to do the work of two.”\r\n\r\n“No, no good woman, leave your son alone, we will not sit down. You have\r\na boy there who will take care of you, and who is quite fit to take his\r\nfather’s place.”\r\n\r\n“Go and change your clothes, Jacques,” cried the widow; “you will be\r\nwanted directly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, good-bye, mother,” said Benassis.\r\n\r\n“Your servant, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“Here, you see, death is looked upon as an event for which every one is\r\nprepared,” said the doctor; “it brings no interruption to the course of\r\nfamily life, and they will not even wear mourning of any kind. No one\r\ncares to be at the expense of it; they are all either too poor or too\r\nparsimonious in the villages hereabouts, so that mourning is unknown\r\nin country districts. Yet the custom of wearing mourning is something\r\nbetter than a law or a usage, it is an institution somewhat akin to all\r\nmoral obligations. But in spite of our endeavors neither M. Janvier nor\r\nI have succeeded in making our peasants understand the great importance\r\nof public demonstrations of feeling for the maintenance of social\r\norder. These good folk, who have only just begun to think and act for\r\nthemselves, are slow as yet to grasp the changed conditions which should\r\nattach them to these theories. They have only reached those ideas which\r\nconduce to economy and to physical welfare; in the future, if some one\r\nelse carries on this work of mine, they will come to understand the\r\nprinciples that serve to uphold and preserve public order and justice.\r\nAs a matter of fact, it is not sufficient to be an honest man, you must\r\nappear to be honest in the eyes of others. Society does not live by\r\nmoral ideas alone; its existence depends upon actions in harmony with\r\nthose ideas.\r\n\r\n“In most country communes, out of a hundred families deprived by death\r\nof their head, there are only a few individuals capable of feeling more\r\nkeenly than the others, who will remember the deaths for very long; in\r\na year’s time the rest will have forgotten all about it. Is not this\r\nforgetfulness a sore evil? A religion is the very heart of a nation; it\r\nexpresses their feelings and their thoughts, and exalts them by giving\r\nthem an object; but unless outward and visible honor is paid to a God,\r\nreligion cannot exist; and, as a consequence, human ordinances lose all\r\ntheir force. If the conscience belongs to God and to Him only, the body\r\nis amenable to social law. Is it not therefore, a first step towards\r\natheism to efface every sign of pious sorrow in this way, to neglect to\r\nimpress on children who are not yet old enough to reflect, and on all\r\nother people who stand in need of example, the necessity of obedience to\r\nhuman law, by openly manifested resignation to the will of Providence,\r\nwho chastens and consoles, who bestows and takes away worldly wealth? I\r\nconfess that, after passing through a period of sneering incredulity,\r\nI have come during my life here to recognize the value of the rites of\r\nreligion and of religious observances in the family, and to discern the\r\nimportance of household customs and domestic festivals. The family will\r\nalways be the basis of human society. Law and authority are first felt\r\nthere; there, at any rate, the habit of obedience should be learned.\r\nViewed in the light of all their consequences, the spirit of the family\r\nand paternal authority are two elements but little developed as yet\r\nin our new legislative system. Yet in the family, the commune, the\r\ndepartment, lies the whole of our country. The laws ought therefore to\r\nbe based on these three great divisions.\r\n\r\n“In my opinion, marriages, the birth of infants, and the deaths of\r\nheads of households cannot be surrounded with too much circumstance. The\r\nsecret of the strength of Catholicism, and of the deep root that it has\r\ntaken in the ordinary life of man, lies precisely in this--that it steps\r\nin to invest every important event in his existence with a pomp that\r\nis so naively touching, and so grand, whenever the priest rises to\r\nthe height of his mission and brings his office into harmony with the\r\nsublimity of Christian doctrine.\r\n\r\n“Once I looked upon the Catholic religion as a cleverly exploited mass\r\nof prejudices and superstitions, which an intelligent civilization\r\nought to deal with according to its desserts. Here I have discovered its\r\npolitical necessity and its usefulness as a moral agent; here, moreover,\r\nI have come to understand its power, through a knowledge of the actual\r\nthing which the word expresses. Religion means a bond or tie, and\r\ncertainly a cult--or, in other words, the outward and visible form of\r\nreligion is the only force that can bind the various elements of society\r\ntogether and mould them into a permanent form. Lastly, it was also here\r\nthat I have felt the soothing influence that religion sheds over the\r\nwounds of humanity, and (without going further into the subject) I have\r\nseen how admirably it is suited to the fervid temperaments of southern\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n“Let us take the road up the hillside,” said the doctor, interrupting\r\nhimself; “we must reach the plateau up there. Thence we shall look down\r\nupon both valleys, and you will see a magnificent view. The plateau lies\r\nthree thousand feet above the level of the Mediterranean; we shall see\r\nover Savoy and Dauphine, and the mountain ranges of the Lyonnais and\r\nRhone. We shall be in another commune, a hill commune, and on a farm\r\nbelonging to M. Gravier you will see the kind of scene of which I have\r\nspoken. There the great events of life are invested with a solemnity\r\nwhich comes up to my ideas. Mourning for the dead is vigorously\r\nprescribed. Poor people will beg in order to purchase black clothing,\r\nand no one refuses to give in such a case. There are few days in which\r\nthe widow does not mention her loss; she always speaks of it with tears,\r\nand her grief is as deep after ten days of sorrow as on the morning\r\nafter her bereavement. Manners are patriarchal: the father’s authority\r\nis unlimited, his word is law. He takes his meals sitting by himself at\r\nthe head of the table; his wife and children wait upon him, and those\r\nabout him never address him without using certain respectful forms of\r\nspeech, while every one remains standing and uncovered in his presence.\r\nMen brought up in this atmosphere are conscious of their dignity; to my\r\nway of thinking, it is a noble education to be brought up among\r\nthese customs. And, for the most part, they are upright, thrifty, and\r\nhardworking people in this commune. The father of every family, when he\r\nis old and past work, divides his property equally among his children,\r\nand they support him; that is the usual way here. An old man of ninety,\r\nin the last century, who had divided everything he had among his four\r\nchildren, went to live with each in turn for three months in the year.\r\nAs he left the oldest to go to the home of a younger brother, one of\r\nhis friends asked him, ‘Well, are you satisfied with the arrangement?’\r\n‘Faith! yes,’ the old man answered; ‘they have treated me as if I had\r\nbeen their own child.’ That answer of his seemed so remarkable to an\r\nofficer then stationed at Grenoble, that he repeated it in more than one\r\nParisian salon. That officer was the celebrated moralist Vauvenargues,\r\nand in this way the beautiful saying came to the knowledge of another\r\nwriter named Chamfort. Ah! still more forcible phrases are often struck\r\nout among us, but they lack a historian worthy of them.”\r\n\r\n“I have come across Moravians and Lollards in Bohemia and Hungary,” said\r\nGenestas. “They are a kind of people something like your mountaineers,\r\ngood folk who endure the sufferings of war with angelic patience.”\r\n\r\n“Men living under simple and natural conditions are bound to be almost\r\nalike in all countries. Sincerity of life takes but one form. It is true\r\nthat a country life often extinguishes thought of a wider kind; but evil\r\npropensities are weakened and good qualities are developed by it. In\r\nfact, the fewer the numbers of the human beings collected together in a\r\nplace, the less crime, evil thinking, and general bad behavior will\r\nbe found in it. A pure atmosphere counts for a good deal in purity of\r\nmorals.”\r\n\r\nThe two horsemen, who had been climbing the stony road at a foot pace,\r\nnow reached the level space of which Benassis had spoken. It is a strip\r\nof land lying round about the base of a lofty mountain peak, a bare\r\nsurface of rock with no growth of any kind upon it; deep clefts are\r\nriven in its sheer inaccessible sides. The gray crest of the summit\r\ntowers above the ledge of fertile soil which lies around it, a domain\r\nsometimes narrower, sometimes wider, and altogether about a hundred\r\nacres in extent. Here, through a vast break in the line of the hills to\r\nthe south, the eye sees French Maurienne, Dauphine, the crags of Savoy,\r\nand the far-off mountains of the Lyonnais. Genestas was gazing from this\r\npoint, over a land that lay far and wide in the spring sunlight, when\r\nthere arose the sound of a wailing cry.\r\n\r\n“Let us go on,” said Benassis; “the wail for the dead has begun, that is\r\nthe name they give to this part of the funeral rites.”\r\n\r\nOn the western slope of the mountain peak, the commandant saw the\r\nbuildings belonging to a farm of some size. The whole place formed a\r\nperfect square. The gateway consisted of a granite arch, impressive in\r\nits solidity, which added to the old-world appearance of the buildings\r\nwith the ancient trees that stood about them, and the growth of plant\r\nlife on the roofs. The house itself lay at the farther end of the yard.\r\nBarns, sheepfolds, stables, cowsheds, and other buildings lay on either\r\nside, and in the midst was the great pool where the manure had been laid\r\nto rot. On a thriving farm, such a yard as this is usually full of life\r\nand movement, but to-day it was silent and deserted. The poultry was\r\nshut up, the cattle were all in the byres, there was scarcely a sound of\r\nanimal life. Both stables and cowsheds had been carefully swept across\r\nthe yard. The perfect neatness which reigned in a place where everything\r\nas a rule was in disorder, the absence of stirring life, the stillness\r\nin so noisy a spot, the calm serenity of the hills, the deep shadow cast\r\nby the towering peak--everything combined to make a strong impression on\r\nthe mind.\r\n\r\nGenestas was accustomed to painful scenes, yet he could not help\r\nshuddering as he saw a dozen men and women standing weeping outside the\r\ndoor of the great hall. “_The master is dead!_” they wailed; the unison\r\nof voices gave appalling effect to the words which they repeated twice\r\nduring the time required to cross the space between the gateway and the\r\nfarmhouse door. To this wailing lament succeeded moans from within the\r\nhouse; the sound of a woman’s voice came through the casements.\r\n\r\n“I dare not intrude upon such grief as this,” said Genestas to Benassis.\r\n\r\n“I always go to visit a bereaved family,” the doctor answered, “either\r\nto certify the death, or to see that no mischance caused by grief has\r\nbefallen the living. You need not hesitate to come with me. The scene is\r\nimpressive, and there will be such a great many people that no one will\r\nnotice your presence.”\r\n\r\nAs Genestas followed the doctor, he found, in fact, that the first room\r\nwas full of relations of the dead. They passed through the crowd and\r\nstationed themselves at the door of a bedroom that opened out of\r\nthe great hall which served the whole family for a kitchen and a\r\nsitting-room; the whole colony, it should rather be called, for the\r\ngreat length of the table showed that some forty people lived in\r\nthe house. Benassis’ arrival interrupted the discourse of a tall,\r\nsimply-dressed woman, with thin locks of hair, who held the dead man’s\r\nhand in hers in a way that spoke eloquently.\r\n\r\nThe dead master of the house had been arrayed in his best clothes, and\r\nnow lay stretched out cold and stiff upon the bed. They had drawn the\r\ncurtains aside; the thought of heaven seemed to brood over the quiet\r\nface and the white hair--it was like the closing scene of a drama. On\r\neither side of the bed stood the children and the nearest relations of\r\nthe husband and wife. These last stood in a line on either side; the\r\nwife’s kin upon the left, and those of her husband on the right. Both\r\nmen and women were kneeling in prayer, and almost all of them were in\r\ntears. Tall candles stood about the bed. The cure of the parish and his\r\nassistants had taken their places in the middle of the room, beside the\r\nbier. There was something tragical about the scene, with the head of the\r\nfamily lying before the coffin, which was waiting to be closed down upon\r\nhim forever.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried the widow, turning as she saw Benassis, “if the skill of\r\nthe best of men could not save you, my dear lord, it was because it was\r\nordained in heaven that you should precede me to the tomb! Yes, this\r\nhand of yours, that used to press mine so kindly, is cold! I have lost\r\nmy dear helpmate for ever, and our household has lost its beloved head,\r\nfor truly you were the guide of us all! Alas! there is not one of those\r\nwho are weeping with me who has not known all the worth of your nature,\r\nand felt the light of your soul, but I alone knew all the patience and\r\nthe kindness of your heart. Oh! my husband, my husband! must I bid you\r\nfarewell for ever? Farewell to you, our stay and support! Farewell to\r\nyou, my dear master! And we, your children,--for to each of us you gave\r\nthe same fatherly love,--all we, your children, have lost our father!”\r\n\r\nThe widow flung herself upon the dead body and clasped it in a tight\r\nembrace, as if her kisses and the tears with which she covered it could\r\ngive it warmth again; during the pause, came the wail of the servants:\r\n\r\n“_The master is dead!_”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” the widow went on, “he is dead! Our beloved who gave us our\r\nbread, who sowed and reaped for us, who watched over our happiness, who\r\nguided us through life, who ruled so kindly among us. _Now_, I may speak\r\nin his praise, and say that he never caused me the slightest sorrow; he\r\nwas good and strong and patient. Even while we were torturing him for\r\nthe sake of his health, so precious to us, ‘Let it be, children, it is\r\nall no use,’ the dear lamb said, just in the same tone of voice with\r\nwhich he had said, ‘Everything is all right, friends,’ only a few days\r\nbefore. Ah! _grand Dieu_! a few days ago! A few days have been enough to\r\ntake away the gladness from our house and to darken our lives, to close\r\nthe eyes of the best, most upright, most revered of men. No one could\r\nplow as he could. Night or day, he would go about over the mountains, he\r\nfeared nothing, and when he came back he had always a smile for his wife\r\nand children. Ah! he was our beloved! It was dull here by the fireside\r\nwhen _he_ was away, and our food lost all its relish. Oh! how will it be\r\nnow, when our guardian angel will be laid away under the earth, and we\r\nshall never see him any more? Never any more, dear kinsfolk and friends;\r\nnever any more, my children! Yes, my children have lost their kind\r\nfather, our relations and friends have lost their good kinsman and\r\ntheir trusty friend, the household has lost its master, and I have lost\r\neverything!”\r\n\r\nShe took the hand of the dead again, and knelt, so that she might press\r\nher face close to his as she kissed it. The servants’ cry, “_The master\r\nis dead!_” was again repeated three times.\r\n\r\nJust then the eldest son came to his mother to say, “The people from\r\nSaint-Laurent have just come, mother; we want some wine for them.”\r\n\r\n“Take the keys,” she said in a low tone, and in a different voice from\r\nthat in which she had just expressed her grief; “you are the master of\r\nthe house, my son; see that they receive the welcome that your father\r\nwould have given them; do not let them find any change.\r\n\r\n“Let me have one more long look,” she went on. “But alas! my good\r\nhusband, you do not feel my presence now, I cannot bring back warmth to\r\nyou! I only wish that I could comfort you still, could let you know that\r\nso long as I live you will dwell in the heart that you made glad, could\r\ntell you that I shall be happy in the memory of my happiness--that\r\nthe dear thought of you will live on in this room. Yes, as long as God\r\nspares me, this room shall be filled with memories of you. Hear my vow,\r\ndear husband! Your couch shall always remain as it is now. I will sleep\r\nin it no more, since you are dead; henceforward, while I live, it shall\r\nbe cold and empty. With you, I have lost all that makes a woman: her\r\nmaster, husband, father, friend, companion, and helpmate: I have lost\r\nall!”\r\n\r\n“_The master is dead!_” the servants wailed. Others raised the cry, and\r\nthe lament became general. The widow took a pair of scissors that hung\r\nat her waist, cut off her hair, and laid the locks in her husband’s\r\nhand. Deep silence fell on them all.\r\n\r\n“That act means that she will not marry again,” said Benassis; “this\r\ndetermination was expected by many of the relatives.”\r\n\r\n“Take it, dear lord!” she said; her emotion brought a tremor to her\r\nvoice that went to the hearts of all who heard her. “I have sworn to be\r\nfaithful; I give this pledge to you to keep in the grave. We shall thus\r\nbe united for ever, and through love of your children I will live on\r\namong the family in whom you used to feel yourself young again. Oh! that\r\nyou could hear me, my husband! the pride and joy of my heart! Oh! that\r\nyou could know that all my power to live, now you are dead, will yet\r\ncome from you; for I shall live to carry out your sacred wishes and to\r\nhonor your memory.”\r\n\r\nBenassis pressed Genestas’ hand as an invitation to follow him, and they\r\nwent out. By this time the first room was full of people who had come\r\nfrom another mountain commune; all of them waited in meditative silence,\r\nas if the sorrow and grief that brooded over the house had already\r\ntaken possession of them. As Benassis and the commandant crossed the\r\nthreshold, they overheard a few words that passed between one of the\r\nnewcomers and the eldest son of the late owner.\r\n\r\n“Then when did he die?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed the eldest son, a man of five-and-twenty years of age,\r\n“I did not see him die. He asked for me, and I was not there!” His voice\r\nwas broken with sobs, but he went on: “He said to me the night before,\r\n‘You must go over to the town, my boy, and pay our taxes; my funeral\r\nwill put that out of your minds, and we shall be behindhand, a thing\r\nthat has never happened before.’ It seemed the best thing to do, so\r\nI went; and while I was gone, he died, and I never received his last\r\nembrace. I have always been at his side, but he did not see me near him\r\nat the last in my place where I had always been.”\r\n\r\n“_The master is dead!_”\r\n\r\n“Alas! he is dead, and I was not there to receive his last words and\r\nhis latest sigh. And what did the taxes matter? Would it not have been\r\nbetter to lose all our money than to leave home just then? Could all\r\nthat we have make up to me for the loss of his last farewell. No. _Mon\r\nDieu!_ If _your_ father falls ill, Jean, do not go away and leave him,\r\nor you will lay up a lifelong regret for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Genestas, “I have seen thousands of men die on the\r\nbattlefield; death did not wait to let their children bid them farewell;\r\ntake comfort, you are not the only one.”\r\n\r\n“But a father who was such a good man!” he replied, bursting into fresh\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nBenassis took Genestas in the direction of the farm buildings.\r\n\r\n“The funeral oration will only cease when the body has been laid in its\r\ncoffin,” said the doctor, “and the weeping woman’s language will grow\r\nmore vivid and impassioned all the while. But a woman only acquires\r\nthe right to speak in such a strain before so imposing an audience by a\r\nblameless life. If the widow could reproach herself with the smallest\r\nof shortcomings, she would not dare to utter a word; for if she did, she\r\nwould pronounce her own condemnation, she would be at the same time her\r\nown accuser and judge. Is there not something sublime in this custom\r\nwhich thus judges the living and the dead? They only begin to wear\r\nmourning after a week has elapsed, when it is publicly worn at a meeting\r\nof all the family. Their near relations spend the week with the widow\r\nand children, to help them to set their affairs in order and to console\r\nthem. A family gathering at such a time produces a great effect on the\r\nminds of the mourners; the consideration for others which possesses men\r\nwhen they are brought into close contact acts as a restraint on violent\r\ngrief. On the last day, when the mourning garb has been assumed, a\r\nsolemn banquet is given, and their relations take leave of them. All\r\nthis is taken very seriously. Any one who was slack in fulfilling his\r\nduties after the death of the head of a family would have no one at his\r\nown funeral.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor had reached the cowhouse as he spoke; he opened the door and\r\nmade the commandant enter, that he might show it to him.\r\n\r\n“All our cowhouses have been rebuilt after this pattern, captain. Look!\r\nIs it not magnificent?”\r\n\r\nGenestas could not help admiring the huge place. The cows and oxen stood\r\nin two rows, with their tails towards the side walls, and their heads\r\nin the middle of the shed. Access to the stalls was afforded by a fairly\r\nwide space between them and the wall; you could see their horned heads\r\nand shining eyes through the lattice work, so that it was easy for the\r\nmaster to run his eyes over the cattle. The fodder was placed on some\r\nstaging erected above the stalls, so that it fell into the racks below\r\nwithout waste of labor or material. There was a wide-paved space down\r\nthe centre, which was kept clean, and ventilated by a thorough draught\r\nof air.\r\n\r\n“In the winter time,” Benassis said, as he walked with Genestas down the\r\nmiddle of the cowhouse, “both men and women do their work here together\r\nin the evenings. The tables are set out here, and in this way the people\r\nkeep themselves warm without going to any expense. The sheep are housed\r\nin the same way. You would not believe how quickly the beasts fall into\r\norderly ways. I have often wondered to see them come in; each knows her\r\nproper place, and allows those who take precedence to pass in before\r\nher. Look! there is just room enough in each stall to do the milking\r\nand to rub the cattle down; and the floor slopes a little to facilitate\r\ndrainage.”\r\n\r\n“One can judge of everything else from the sight of this cowhouse,” said\r\nGenestas; “without flattery, these are great results indeed!”\r\n\r\n“We have had some trouble to bring them about,” Benassis answered; “but\r\nthen, see what fine cattle they are!”\r\n\r\n“They are splendid beasts certainly; you had good reason to praise them\r\nto me,” answered Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said the doctor, when he had mounted his horse and passed under\r\nthe gateway, “we are going over some of the newly cleared waste, and\r\nthrough the corn land. I have christened this little corner of our\r\nCommune, ‘La Beauce.’”\r\n\r\nFor about an hour they rode at a foot pace across fields in a state of\r\nhigh cultivation, on which the soldier complimented the doctor; then\r\nthey came down the mountain side into the township again, talking\r\nwhenever the pace of their horses allowed them to do so. At last they\r\nreached a narrow glen, down which they rode into the main valley.\r\n\r\n“I promised yesterday,” Benassis said to Genestas, “to show you one of\r\nthe two soldiers who left the army and came back to us after the fall of\r\nNapoleon. We shall find him somewhere hereabouts, if I am not mistaken.\r\nThe mountain streams flow into a sort of natural reservoir or tarn up\r\nhere; the earth they bring down has silted it up, and he is engaged in\r\nclearing it out. But if you are to take any interest in the man, I must\r\ntell you his history. His name is Gondrin. He was only eighteen years\r\nold when he was drawn in the great conscription of 1792, and drafted\r\ninto a corps of gunners. He served as a private soldier in Napoleon’s\r\ncampaigns in Italy, followed him to Egypt, and came back from the East\r\nafter the Peace of Amiens. In the time of the Empire he was incorporated\r\nin the Pontoon Troop of the Guard, and was constantly on active service\r\nin Germany, lastly the poor fellow made the Russian campaign.”\r\n\r\n“We are brothers-in-arms then, to some extent,” said Genestas; “I have\r\nmade the same campaigns. Only an iron frame would stand the tricks\r\nplayed by so many different climates. My word for it, those who are\r\nstill standing on their stumps after marching over Italy, Egypt,\r\nGermany, Portugal, and Russia must have applied to Providence and taken\r\nout a patent for living.”\r\n\r\n“Just so, you will see a solid fragment of a man,” answered Benassis.\r\n“You know all about the Retreat from Moscow; it is useless to tell you\r\nabout it. This man I have told you of is one of the pontooners of the\r\nBeresina; he helped to construct the bridge by which the army made the\r\npassage, and stood waist-deep in water to drive in the first piles.\r\nGeneral Eble, who was in command of the pontooners, could only find\r\nforty-two men who were plucky enough, in Gondrin’s phrase, to tackle\r\nthat business. The general himself came down to the stream to hearten\r\nand cheer the men, promising each of them a pension of a thousand francs\r\nand the Cross of the Legion of Honor. The first who went down into the\r\nBeresina had his leg taken off by a block of ice, and the man himself\r\nwas washed away; but you will better understand the difficulty of the\r\ntask when you hear the end of the story. Of the forty-two volunteers,\r\nGondrin is the only one alive to-day. Thirty-nine of them lost their\r\nlives in the Beresina, and the two others died miserably in a Polish\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n“The poor fellow himself only returned from Wilna in 1814, to find the\r\nBourbons restored to power. General Eble (of whom Gondrin cannot speak\r\nwithout tears in his eyes) was dead. The pontooner was deaf, and his\r\nhealth was shattered; and as he could neither read nor write, he found\r\nno one left to help him or to plead his cause. He begged his way to\r\nParis, and while there made application at the War Office, not for the\r\nthousand francs of extra pension which had been promised to him, nor yet\r\nfor the Cross of the Legion of Honor, but only for the bare pension due\r\nto him after twenty-two years of service, and I do not know how many\r\ncampaigns. He did not obtain his pension or his traveling expenses;\r\nhe did not even receive his arrears of pay. He spent a year in making\r\nfruitless solicitations, holding out his hands in vain to those whom he\r\nhad saved; and at the end of it he came back here, sorely disheartened\r\nbut resigned to his fate. This hero unknown to fame does draining work\r\non the land, for which he is paid ten sous the fathom. He is accustomed\r\nto working in a marshy soil, and so, as he says, he gets jobs which no\r\none else cares to take. He can make about three francs a day by clearing\r\nout ponds, or draining meadows that lie under water. His deafness makes\r\nhim seem surly, and he is not naturally inclined to say very much, but\r\nthere is a good deal in him.\r\n\r\n“We are very good friends. He dines with me on the day of Austerlitz,\r\non the Emperor’s birthday, and on the anniversary of the disaster at\r\nWaterloo, and during the dessert he always receives a napoleon to pay\r\nfor his wine very quarter. Every one in the Commune shares in my feeling\r\nof respect for him; if he would allow them to support him, nothing would\r\nplease them better. At every house to which he goes the people follow my\r\nexample, and show their esteem by asking him to dine with them. It is a\r\nfeeling of pride that leads him to work, and it is only as a portrait of\r\nthe Emperor that he can be induced to take my twenty-franc piece. He has\r\nbeen deeply wounded by the injustice that has been done to him; but I\r\nthink regret for the Cross is greater than the desire for his pension.\r\n\r\n“He has one great consolation. After the bridges had been constructed\r\nacross the Beresina, General Eble presented such of the pontooners\r\nas were not disabled to the Emperor, and Napoleon embraced poor\r\nGondrin--perhaps but for that accolade he would have died ere now. This\r\nmemory and the hope that some day Napoleon will return are all that\r\nGondrin lives by. Nothing will ever persuade him that Napoleon is dead,\r\nand so convinced is he that the Emperor’s captivity is wholly and solely\r\ndue to the English, that I believe he would be ready on the slightest\r\npretext to take the life of the best-natured alderman that ever traveled\r\nfor pleasure in foreign parts.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go on as fast as possible!” cried Genestas. He had listened\r\nto the doctor’s story with rapt attention, and now seemed to recover\r\nconsciousness of his surroundings. “Let us hurry! I long to see that\r\nman!”\r\n\r\nBoth of them put their horses to a gallop.\r\n\r\n“The other soldier that I spoke of,” Benassis went on, “is another of\r\nthose men of iron who have knocked about everywhere with our armies.\r\nHis life, like that of all French soldiers, has been made up of bullets,\r\nsabre strokes, and victories; he has had a very rough time of it, and\r\nhas only worn the woolen epaulettes. He has a fanatical affection for\r\nNapoleon, who conferred the Cross upon him on the field of Valontina. He\r\nis of a jovial turn of mind, and like a genuine Dauphinois, has always\r\nlooked after his own interests, has his pension, and the honors of the\r\nLegion. Goguelat is his name. He was an infantry man, who exchanged into\r\nthe Guard in 1812. He is Gondrin’s better half, so to speak, for the two\r\nhave taken up house together. They both lodge with a peddler’s widow,\r\nand make over their money to her. She is a kind soul, who boards them\r\nand looks after them, and their clothes as if they were her children.\r\n\r\n“In his quality of local postman, Goguelat carries all the news of the\r\ncountryside, and a good deal of practice acquired in this way has made\r\nhim an orator in great request at up-sittings, and the champion teller\r\nof stories in the district. Gondrin looks upon him as a very knowing\r\nfellow, and something of a wit; and whenever Goguelat talks about\r\nNapoleon, his comrade seems to understand what he is saying from the\r\nmovement of his lips. There will be an up-sitting (as they call it)\r\nin one of my barns to-night. If these two come over to it, and we can\r\nmanage to see without being seen, I shall treat you to a view of the\r\nspectacle. But here we are, close to the ditch, and I do not see my\r\nfriend the pontooner.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the commandant looked everywhere about them; Gondrin’s\r\nsoldier’s coat lay there beside a heap of black mud, and his\r\nwheelbarrow, spade, and pickaxe were visible, but there was no sign of\r\nthe man himself along the various pebbly watercourses, for the wayward\r\nmountain streams had hollowed out channels that were almost overgrown\r\nwith low bushes.\r\n\r\n“He cannot be so very far away. Gondrin! Where are you?” shouted\r\nBenassis.\r\n\r\nGenestas first saw the curling smoke from a tobacco pipe rise among the\r\nbrushwood on a bank of rubbish not far away. He pointed it out to the\r\ndoctor, who shouted again. The old pontooner raised his head at this,\r\nrecognized the mayor, and came towards them down a little pathway.\r\n\r\n“Well, old friend,” said Benassis, making a sort of speaking-trumpet\r\nwith his hand. “Here is a comrade of yours, who was out in Egypt, come\r\nto see you.”\r\n\r\nGondrin raised is face at once and gave Genestas a swift, keen, and\r\nsearching look, one of those glances by which old soldiers are wont at\r\nonce to take the measure of any impending danger. He saw the red ribbon\r\nthat the commandant wore, and made a silent and respectful military\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n“If the Little Corporal were alive,” the officer cried, “you would have\r\nthe Cross of the Legion of Honor and a handsome pension besides, for\r\nevery man who wore epaulettes on the other side of the river owed his\r\nlife to you on the 1st of October 1812. But I am not the Minister of\r\nWar, my friend,” the commandant added as he dismounted, and with a\r\nsudden rush of feeling he grasped the laborer’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe old pontooner drew himself up at the words, he knocked the ashes\r\nfrom his pipe, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n“I only did my duty, sir,” he said, with his head bent down; “but others\r\nhave not done their duty by me. They asked for my papers! Why, the\r\nTwenty-ninth Bulletin, I told them, must do instead of my papers!”\r\n\r\n“But you must make another application, comrade. You are bound to have\r\njustice done you in these days, if influence is brought to bear in the\r\nright quarter.”\r\n\r\n“Justice!” cried the veteran. The doctor and the commandant shuddered at\r\nthe tone in which he spoke.\r\n\r\nIn the brief pause that followed, both the horsemen looked at the man\r\nbefore them, who seemed like a fragment of the wreck of great armies\r\nwhich Napoleon had filled with men of bronze sought out from among three\r\ngenerations. Gondrin was certainly a splendid specimen of that seemingly\r\nindestructible mass of men which might be cut to pieces but never gave\r\nway. The old man was scarcely five feet high, wide across the shoulders,\r\nand broad-chested; his face was sunburned, furrowed with deep wrinkles,\r\nbut the outlines were still firm in spite of the hollows in it, and\r\none could see even now that it was the face of a soldier. It was a\r\nrough-hewn countenance, his forehead seemed like a block of granite;\r\nbut there was a weary expression about his face, and the gray hairs\r\nhung scantily about his head, as if life were waning there already.\r\nEverything about him indicated unusual strength; his arms were covered\r\nthickly with hair, and so was the chest, which was visible through the\r\nopening of his coarse shirt. In spite of his almost crooked legs, he\r\nheld himself firm and erect, as if nothing could shake him.\r\n\r\n“Justice,” he said once more; “there will never be justice for the like\r\nof us. We cannot send bailiffs to the Government to demand our dues for\r\nus; and as the wallet must be filled somehow,” he said, striking his\r\nstomach, “we cannot afford to wait. Moreover, these gentry who lead snug\r\nlives in government offices may talk and talk, but their words are not\r\ngood to eat, so I have come back here again to draw my pay out of the\r\ncommonalty,” he said, striking the mud with his spade.\r\n\r\n“Things must not be left in that way, old comrade,” said Genestas. “I\r\nowe my life to you, and it would be ungrateful of me if I did not lend\r\nyou a hand. I have not forgotten the passage over the bridges in the\r\nBeresina, and it is fresh in the memories of some brave fellows of my\r\nacquaintance; they will back me up, and the nation shall give you the\r\nrecognition you deserve.”\r\n\r\n“You will be called a Bonapartist! Please do not meddle in the matter,\r\nsir. I have gone to the rear now, and I have dropped into my hole here\r\nlike a spent bullet. But after riding on camels through the desert,\r\nand drinking my glass by the fireside in Moscow, I never thought that I\r\nshould come back to die here beneath the trees that my father planted,”\r\n and he began to work again.\r\n\r\n“Poor old man!” said Genestas, as they turned to go. “I should do the\r\nsame if I were in his place; we have lost our father. Everything seems\r\ndark to me now that I have seen that man’s hopelessness,” he went on,\r\naddressing Benassis; “he does not know how much I am interested in him,\r\nand he will think that I am one of those gilded rascals who cannot feel\r\nfor a soldier’s sufferings.”\r\n\r\nHe turned quickly and went back, grasped the veteran’s hand, and spoke\r\nloudly in his ear:\r\n\r\n“I swear by the Cross I wear--the Cross of Honor it used to be--that I\r\nwill do all that man can do to obtain your pension for you; even if I\r\nhave to swallow a dozen refusals from the minister, and to petition the\r\nking and the dauphin and the whole shop!”\r\n\r\nOld Gondrin quivered as he heard the words. He looked hard at Genestas\r\nand said, “Haven’t you served in the ranks?” The commandant nodded. The\r\npontooner wiped his hand and took that of Genestas, which he grasped\r\nwarmly and said:\r\n\r\n“I made the army a present of my life, general, when I waded out into\r\nthe river yonder, and if I am still alive, it is all so much to the\r\ngood. One moment! Do you care to see to the bottom of it? Well, then,\r\never since _somebody_ was pulled down from his place, I have ceased\r\nto care about anything. And, after all,” he went on cheerfully, as he\r\npointed to the land, “they have made over twenty thousand francs to me\r\nhere, and I am taking it out in detail, as _he_ used to say!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, comrade,” said Genestas, touched by the grandeur of this\r\nforgiveness, “at least you shall have the only thing that you cannot\r\nprevent me from giving to you, here below.” The commandant tapped his\r\nheart, looked once more at the old pontooner, mounted his horse again,\r\nand went his way side by side with Benassis.\r\n\r\n“Such cruelty as this on the part of the government foments the strife\r\nbetween rich and poor,” said the doctor. “People who exercise a little\r\nbrief authority have never given a serious thought to the consequences\r\nthat must follow an act of injustice done to a man of the people. It is\r\ntrue that a poor man who needs must work for his daily bread cannot long\r\nkeep up the struggle; but he can talk, and his words find an echo in\r\nevery sufferer’s heart, so that one bad case of this kind is multiplied,\r\nfor every one who hears of it feels it as a personal wrong, and the\r\nleaven works. Even this is not so serious, but something far worse comes\r\nof it. Among the people, these causes of injustice bring about a chronic\r\nstate of smothered hatred for their social superiors. The middle class\r\nbecomes the poor man’s enemy; they lie without the bounds of his moral\r\ncode, he tells lies to them and robs them without scruple; indeed, theft\r\nceases to be a crime or a misdemeanor, and is looked upon as an act of\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\n“When an official, who ought to see that the poor have justice done\r\nthem, uses them ill and cheats them of their due, how can we expect the\r\npoor starving wretches to bear their troubles meekly and to respect the\r\nrights of property? It makes me shudder to think that some understrapper\r\nwhose business it is to dust papers in a government office, has pocketed\r\nGondrin’s promised thousand francs of pension. And yet there are folk\r\nwho, never having measured the excess of the people’s sufferings, accuse\r\nthe people of excess in the day of their vengeance! When a government\r\nhas done more harm than good to individuals, its further existence\r\ndepends on the merest accident, the masses square the account after\r\ntheir fashion by upsetting it. A statesman ought always to imagine\r\nJustice with the poor at her feet, for justice was only invented for the\r\npoor.”\r\n\r\nWhen they had come within the compass of the township, Benassis saw\r\ntwo people walking along the road in front of them, and turned to his\r\ncompanion, who had been absorbed for some time in thought.\r\n\r\n“You have seen a veteran soldier resigned to his life of wretchedness,\r\nand now you are about to see an old agricultural laborer who is\r\nsubmitting to the same lot. The man there ahead of us has dug and sown\r\nand toiled for others all his life.”\r\n\r\nGenestas looked and saw an old laborer making his way along the road, in\r\ncompany with an aged woman. He seemed to be afflicted with some form\r\nof sciatica, and limped painfully along. His feet were encased in a\r\nwretched pair of sabots, and a sort of wallet hung over his shoulder.\r\nSeveral tools lay in the bottom of the bag; their handles, blackened\r\nwith long use and the sweat of toil, rattled audibly together; while the\r\nother end of the wallet behind his shoulder held bread, some walnuts,\r\nand a few fresh onions. His legs seemed to be warped, as it were, his\r\nback was bent by continual toil; he stooped so much as he walked that\r\nhe leaned on a long stick to steady himself. His snow-white hair escaped\r\nfrom under a battered hat, grown rusty by exposure to all sorts of\r\nweather, and mended here and there with visible stitches of white\r\nthread. His clothes, made of a kind of rough canvas, were a mass of\r\npatches of contrasting colors. This piece of humanity in ruins lacked\r\nnone of the characteristics that appeal to our hearts when we see ruins\r\nof other kinds.\r\n\r\nHis wife held herself somewhat more erect. Her clothing was likewise a\r\nmass of rags, and the cap that she wore was of the coarsest materials.\r\nOn her back she carried a rough earthen jar by means of a thong passed\r\nthrough the handles of the great pitcher, which was round in shape and\r\nflattened at the sides. They both looked up when they heard the horses\r\napproaching, saw that it was Benassis, and stopped.\r\n\r\nThe man had worked till he was almost past work, and his faithful\r\nhelpmate was no less broken with toil. It was painful to see how the\r\nsummer sun and the winter’s cold had blackened their faces, and\r\ncovered them with such deep wrinkles that their features were hardly\r\ndiscernible. It was not their life history that had been engraven on\r\ntheir faces; but it might be gathered from their attitude and bearing.\r\nIncessant toil had been the lot of both; they had worked and suffered\r\ntogether; they had had many troubles and few joys to share; and now,\r\nlike captives grown accustomed to their prison, they seemed to be too\r\nfamiliar with wretchedness to heed it, and to take everything as it\r\ncame. Yet a certain frank light-heartedness was not lacking in their\r\nfaces; and on a closer view, their monotonous life, the lot of so many\r\na poor creature, well-nigh seemed an enviable one. Trouble had set its\r\nunmistakable mark on them, but petty cares had left no traces there.\r\n\r\n“Well, my good Father Moreau, I suppose there is no help for it, and you\r\nmust always be working?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, M. Benassis, there are one or two more bits of waste that I\r\nmean to clear for you before I knock off work,” the old man answered\r\ncheerfully, and light shone in his little black eyes.\r\n\r\n“Is that wine that your wife is carrying? If you will not take a rest\r\nnow, you ought at any rate to take wine.”\r\n\r\n“I take a rest? I should not know what to do with myself. The sun and\r\nthe fresh air put life into me when I am out of doors and busy grubbing\r\nup the land. As to the wine, sir, yes, that is wine sure enough, and it\r\nis all through your contriving I know that the Mayor at Courteil lets us\r\nhave it for next to nothing. Ah, you managed it very cleverly, but, all\r\nthe same, I know you had a hand in it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! come, come! Good-day, mother. You are going to work on that bit of\r\nland of Champferlu’s to-day of course?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; I made a beginning there yesterday evening.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” said Benassis. “It must be a satisfaction to you, at times,\r\nto see this hillside. You two have broken up almost the whole of the\r\nland on it yourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Lord! yes, sir,” answered the old woman, “it has been our doing! We\r\nhave fairly earned our bread.”\r\n\r\n“Work, you see, and land to cultivate are the poor man’s consols. That\r\ngood man would think himself disgraced if he went into the poorhouse or\r\nbegged for his bread; he would choose to die pickaxe in hand, out in\r\nthe open, in the sunlight. Faith, he bears a proud heart in him. He has\r\nworked until work has become his very life; and yet death has no terrors\r\nfor him! He is a profound philosopher, little as he suspects it. Old\r\nMoreau’s case suggested the idea to me of founding an almshouse for the\r\ncountry people of the district; a refuge for those who, after working\r\nhard all their lives, have reached an honorable old age of poverty.\r\n\r\n“I had by no means expected to make the fortune which I have acquired\r\nhere; indeed, I myself have no use for it, for a man who has fallen\r\nfrom the pinnacle of his hopes needs very little. It costs but little to\r\nlive, the idler’s life alone is a costly one, and I am not sure that the\r\nunproductive consumer is not robbing the community at large. There was\r\nsome discussion about Napoleon’s pension after his fall; it came to his\r\nears, and he said that five francs a day and a horse to ride was all\r\nthat he needed. I meant to have no more to do with money when I came\r\nhere; but after a time I saw that money means power, and that it is in\r\nfact a necessity, if any good is to be done. So I have made arrangements\r\nin my will for turning my house into an almshouse, in which old people\r\nwho have not Moreau’s fierce independence can end their days. Part of\r\nthe income of nine thousand francs brought in by the mill and the rest\r\nof my property will be devoted to giving outdoor relief in hard winters\r\nto those who really stand in need of it.\r\n\r\n“This foundation will be under the control of the Municipal Council,\r\nwith the addition of the cure, who is to be president; and in this way\r\nthe money made in the district will be returned to it. In my will I have\r\nlaid down the lines on which this institution is to be conducted; it\r\nwould be tedious to go over them, it is enough to say that I have a fund\r\nwhich will some day enable the Commune to award several scholarships for\r\nchildren who show signs of promise in art or science. So, even after\r\nI am gone, my work of civilization will continue. When you have set\r\nyourself to do anything, Captain Bluteau, something within you urges you\r\non, you see, and you cannot bear to leave it unfinished. This craving\r\nwithin us for order and for perfection is one of the signs that point\r\nmost surely to a future existence. Now, let us quicken our pace, I have\r\nmy round to finish, and there are five or six more patients still to be\r\nvisited.”\r\n\r\nThey cantered on for some time in silence, till Benassis said laughingly\r\nto his companion, “Come now, Captain Bluteau, you have drawn me out and\r\nmade me chatter like a magpie, and you have not said a syllable about\r\nyour own history, which must be an interesting one. When a soldier has\r\ncome to your time of life, he has seen so much that he must have more\r\nthan one adventure to tell about.”\r\n\r\n“Why, my history has been simply the history of the army,” answered\r\nGenestas. “Soldiers are all after one pattern. Never in command, always\r\ngiving and taking sabre-cuts in my place, I have lived just like anybody\r\nelse. I have been wherever Napoleon led us, and have borne a part\r\nin every battle in which the Imperial Guard has struck a blow; but\r\neverybody knows all about these events. A soldier has to look after his\r\nhorse, to endure hunger and thirst at times, to fight whenever there is\r\nfighting to be done, and there you have the whole history of his life.\r\nAs simple as saying good-day, is it not? Then there are battles in which\r\nyour horse casts a shoe at the outset, and lands you in a quandary; and\r\nas far as you are concerned, that is the whole of it. In short, I have\r\nseen so many countries, that seeing them has come to be a matter of\r\ncourse; and I have seen so many men die, that I have come to value my\r\nown life at nothing.”\r\n\r\n“But you yourself must have been in danger at times, and it would be\r\ninteresting to hear you tell of your personal adventures.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” answered the commandant.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, tell me about the adventure that made the deepest\r\nimpression upon you. Come! do not hesitate. I shall not think that\r\nyou are wanting in modesty even if you should tell me of some piece of\r\nheroism on your part; and when a man is quite sure that he will not be\r\nmisunderstood, ought he not to find a kind of pleasure in saying, ‘I did\r\nthus’?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, I will tell you about something that gives me a pang\r\nof remorse from time to time. During fifteen years of warfare it never\r\nonce happened that I killed a man, save in legitimate defence of self.\r\nWe are drawn up in a line, and we charge; and if we do not strike down\r\nthose before us, they will begin to draw blood without asking leave, so\r\nyou have to kill if you do not mean to be killed, and your conscience is\r\nquite easy. But once I broke a comrade’s back; it happened in a singular\r\nway, and it has been a painful thing to me to think of afterwards--the\r\nman’s dying grimace haunts me at times. But you shall judge for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n“It was during the retreat from Moscow,” the commandant went on.\r\n“The Grand Army had ceased to be itself; we were more like a herd of\r\nover-driven cattle. Good-bye to discipline! The regiments had lost sight\r\nof their colors, every one was his own master, and the Emperor (one need\r\nnot scruple to say it) knew that it was useless to attempt to exert his\r\nauthority when things had gone so far. When we reached Studzianka,\r\na little place on the other side of the Beresina, we came upon human\r\ndwellings for the first time after several days. There were barns and\r\npeasants’ cabins to destroy, and pits full of potatoes and beetroot;\r\nthe army had been without victual, and now it fairly ran riot, the first\r\ncomers, as you might expect, making a clean sweep of everything.\r\n\r\n“I was one of the last to come up. Luckily for me, sleep was the one\r\nthing that I longed for just then. I caught sight of a barn and went\r\ninto it. I looked round and saw a score of generals and officers of\r\nhigh rank, all of them men who, without flattery, might be called great.\r\nJunot was there, and Narbonne, the Emperor’s aide-de-camp, and all the\r\nchiefs of the army. There were common soldiers there as well, not one of\r\nwhom would have given up his bed of straw to a marshal of France. Some\r\nwho were leaning their backs against the wall had dropped off to sleep\r\nwhere they stood, because there was no room to lie down; others lay\r\nstretched out on the floor--it was a mass of men packed together so\r\nclosely for the sake of warmth, that I looked about in vain for a nook\r\nto lie down in. I walked over this flooring of human bodies; some of the\r\nmen growled, the others said nothing, but no one budged. They would\r\nnot have moved out of the way of a cannon ball just then; but under the\r\ncircumstances, one was not obliged to practise the maxims laid down by\r\nthe Child’s Guide to Manners. Groping about, I saw at the end of\r\nthe barn a sort of ledge up above in the roof; no one had thought of\r\nscrambling up to it, possibly no one had felt equal to the effort. I\r\nclambered up and ensconced myself upon it; and as I lay there at full\r\nlength, I looked down at the men huddled together like sheep below. It\r\nwas a pitiful sight, yet it almost made me laugh. A man here and\r\nthere was gnawing a frozen carrot, with a kind of animal satisfaction\r\nexpressed in his face; and thunderous snores came from generals who lay\r\nmuffled up in ragged cloaks. The whole barn was lighted by a blazing\r\npine log; it might have set the place on fire, and no one would have\r\ntroubled to get up and put it out.\r\n\r\n“I lay down on my back, and, naturally, just before I dropped off, my\r\neyes traveled to the roof above me, and then I saw that the main beam\r\nwhich bore the weight of the joists was being slightly shaken from east\r\nto west. The blessed thing danced about in fine style. ‘Gentlemen,’\r\nsaid I, ‘one of our friends outside has a mind to warm himself at\r\nour expense.’ A few moments more and the beam was sure to come down.\r\n‘Gentlemen! gentlemen!’ I shouted, ‘we shall all be killed in a minute!\r\nLook at the beam there!’ and I made such a noise that my bed-fellows\r\nawoke at last. Well, sir, they all stared up at the beam, and then those\r\nwho had been sleeping turned round and went off to sleep again, while\r\nthose who were eating did not even stop to answer me.\r\n\r\n“Seeing how things were, there was nothing for it but to get up and\r\nleave my place, and run the risk of finding it taken by somebody else,\r\nfor all the lives of this heap of heroes were at stake. So out I go.\r\nI turn the corner of the barn and come upon a great devil of a\r\nWurtemberger, who was tugging at the beam with a certain enthusiasm.\r\n‘Aho! aho!’ I shouted, trying to make him understand that he must\r\ndesist from his toil. ‘_Gehe mir aus dem Gesicht, oder ich schlag dich\r\ntodt!_--Get out of my sight, or I will kill you,’ he cried. ‘Ah! yes,\r\njust so, _Que mire aous dem guesit_,’ I answered; ‘but that is not the\r\npoint.’ I picked up his gun that he had left on the ground, and broke\r\nhis back with it; then I turned in again, and went off to sleep. Now you\r\nknow the whole business.”\r\n\r\n“But that was a case of self-defence, in which one man suffered for\r\nthe good of many, so you have nothing to reproach yourself with,” said\r\nBenassis.\r\n\r\n“The rest of them thought that it had only been my fancy; but fancy or\r\nno, a good many of them are living comfortably in fine houses to-day,\r\nwithout feeling their hearts oppressed by gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Then would you only do people a good turn in order to receive that\r\nexorbitant interest called gratitude?” said Benassis, laughing. “That\r\nwould be asking a great deal for your outlay.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know quite well that all the merit of a good deed evaporates at\r\nonce if it benefits the doer in the slightest degree,” said Genestas.\r\n“If he tells the story of it, the toll brought in to his vanity is a\r\nsufficient substitute for gratitude. But if every doer of kindly actions\r\nalways held his tongue about them, those who reaped the benefits would\r\nhardly say very much either. Now the people, according to your system,\r\nstand in need of examples, and how are they to hear of them amid this\r\ngeneral reticence? Again, there is this poor pontooner of ours, who\r\nsaved the whole French army, and who was never able to tell his tale to\r\nany purpose; suppose that he had lost the use of his limbs, would the\r\nconsciousness of what he had done have found him in bread? Answer me\r\nthat, philosopher!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the rules of morality cannot be absolute,” Benassis answered;\r\n“though this is a dangerous idea, for it leaves the egoist free to\r\nsettle cases of conscience in his own favor. Listen, captain; is not the\r\nman who never swerves from the principles of morality greater than he\r\nwho transgresses them, even through necessity? Would not our veteran,\r\ndying of hunger, and unable to help himself, be worthy of rank with\r\nHomer? Human life is doubtless a final trial of virtue as of genius, for\r\nboth of which a better world is waiting. Virtue and genius seem to me\r\nto be the fairest forms of that complete and constant surrender of self\r\nthat Jesus Christ came among men to teach. Genius sheds its light in the\r\nworld and lives in poverty all its days, and virtue sacrifices itself in\r\nsilence for the general good.”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you, sir,” said Genestas; “but those who dwell on\r\nearth are men after all, and not angels; we are not perfect.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite true,” Benassis answered. “And as for errors, I myself\r\nhave abused the indulgence. But ought we not to aim, at any rate, at\r\nperfection? Is not virtue a fair ideal which the soul must always keep\r\nbefore it, a standard set up by Heaven?”\r\n\r\n“Amen,” said the soldier. “An upright man is a magnificent thing, I\r\ngrant you; but, on the other hand, you must admit that virtue is a\r\ndivinity who may indulge in a scrap of gossip now and then in the\r\nstrictest propriety.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled, but there was a melancholy bitterness in his tone as\r\nhe said, “Ah! sir, you regard things with the lenience natural to those\r\nwho live at peace with themselves; and I with all the severity of one\r\nwho sees much that he would fain obliterate in the story of his life.”\r\n\r\nThe two horsemen reached a cottage beside the bed of the torrent, the\r\ndoctor dismounted and went into the house. Genestas, on the threshold,\r\nlooked over the bright spring landscape that lay without, and then at\r\nthe dark interior of the cottage, where a man was lying in bed. Benassis\r\nexamined his patient, and suddenly exclaimed, “My good woman, it is no\r\nuse my coming here unless you carry out my instructions! You have been\r\ngiving him bread; you want to kill your husband, I suppose? Botheration!\r\nIf after this you give him anything besides the tisane of couch-grass,\r\nI will never set foot in here again, and you can look where you like for\r\nanother doctor.”\r\n\r\n“But, dear M. Benassis, my old man was starving, and when he had eaten\r\nnothing for a whole fortnight----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, yes. Now will you listen to me. If you let your husband eat a\r\nsingle mouthful of bread before I give him leave to take solid food, you\r\nwill kill him, do you hear?”\r\n\r\n“He shall not have anything, sir. Is he any better?” she asked,\r\nfollowing the doctor to the door.\r\n\r\n“Why, no. You have made him worse by feeding him. Shall I never get\r\nit into your stupid heads that you must not stuff people who are being\r\ndieted?”\r\n\r\n“The peasants are incorrigible,” Benassis went on, speaking to Genestas.\r\n“If a patient has eaten nothing for two or three days, they think he is\r\nat death’s door, and they cram him with soup or wine or something. Here\r\nis a wretched woman for you that has all but killed her husband.”\r\n\r\n“Kill my husband with a little mite of a sop in wine!”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, my good woman. It amazes me that he is still alive after the\r\nmess you cooked for him. Mind that you do exactly as I have told you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear sir, I would far rather die myself than lose him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! as to that I shall soon see. I shall come again to-morrow evening\r\nto bleed him.”\r\n\r\n“Let us walk along the side of the stream,” Benassis said to Genestas;\r\n“there is only a footpath between this cottage and the next house where\r\nI must pay a call. That man’s little boy will hold our horses.”\r\n\r\n“You must admire this lovely valley of ours a little,” he went on;\r\n“it is like an English garden, is it not? The laborer who lives in the\r\ncottage which we are going to visit has never got over the death of one\r\nof his children. The eldest boy, he was only a lad, would try to do a\r\nman’s work last harvest-tide; it was beyond his strength, and before the\r\nautumn was out he died of a decline. This is the first case of really\r\nstrong fatherly love that has come under my notice. As a rule, when\r\ntheir children die, the peasant’s regret is for the loss of a useful\r\nchattel, and a part of their stock-in-trade, and the older the child,\r\nthe heavier their sense of loss. A grown-up son or daughter is so much\r\ncapital to the parents. But this poor fellow really loved that boy of\r\nhis. ‘Nothing cam comfort me for my loss,’ he said one day when I came\r\nacross him out in the fields. He had forgotten all about his work, and\r\nwas standing there motionless, leaning on his scythe; he had picked up\r\nhis hone, it lay in his hand, and he had forgotten to use it. He has\r\nnever spoken since of his grief to me, but he has grown sad and silent.\r\nJust now it is one of his little girls who is ill.”\r\n\r\nBenassis and his guest reached the little house as they talked. It stood\r\nbeside a pathway that led to a bark-mill. They saw a man about forty\r\nyears of age, standing under a willow tree, eating bread that had been\r\nrubbed with a clove of garlic.\r\n\r\n“Well, Gasnier, is the little one doing better?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, sir,” he said dejectedly, “you will see; my wife is\r\nsitting with her. In spite of all your care, I am very much afraid that\r\ndeath will come to empty my home for me.”\r\n\r\n“Do not lose heart, Gasnier. Death is too busy to take up his abode in\r\nany dwelling.”\r\n\r\nBenassis went into the house, followed by the father. Half an hour later\r\nhe came out again. The mother was with him this time, and he spoke\r\nto her, “You need have no anxiety about her now; follow out my\r\ninstructions; she is out of danger.”\r\n\r\n“If you are growing tired of this sort of thing,” the doctor said to the\r\nofficer, as he mounted his horse, “I can put you on the way to the town,\r\nand you can return.”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not tired of it, I give you my word.”\r\n\r\n“But you will only see cottages everywhere, and they are all alike;\r\nnothing, to outward seeming, is more monotonous than the country.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go on,” said the officer.\r\n\r\nThey rode on in this way for several hours, and after going from one\r\nside of the canton to the other, they returned towards evening to the\r\nprecincts of the town.\r\n\r\n“I must just go over there,” the doctor said to Genestas, as he pointed\r\nout a place where a cluster of elm-trees grew. “Those trees may possibly\r\nbe two hundred years old,” he went on, “and that is where the woman\r\nlives, on whose account the lad came to fetch me last night at dinner,\r\nwith a message that she had turned quite white.”\r\n\r\n“Was it anything serious?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Benassis, “an effect of pregnancy. It is the last month\r\nwith her, a time at which some women suffer from spasms. But by way of\r\nprecaution, I must go in any case to make sure that there are no further\r\nalarming symptoms; I shall see her through her confinement myself. And,\r\nmoreover, I should like to show you one of our new industries; there is\r\na brick-field here. It is a good road; shall we gallop?”\r\n\r\n“Will your animal keep up with mine?” asked Genestas. “Heigh! Neptune!”\r\n he called to his horse, and in a moment the officer had been carried\r\nfar ahead, and was lost to sight in a cloud of dust, but in spite of the\r\npaces of his horse he still heard the doctor beside him. At a word from\r\nBenassis his own horse left the commandant so far behind that the latter\r\nonly came up with him at the gate of the brick-field, where the doctor\r\nwas quietly fastening the bridle to the gate-post.\r\n\r\n“The devil take it!” cried Genestas, after a look at the horse, that was\r\nneither sweated nor blown. “What kind of animal have you there?”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the doctor, “you took him for a screw! The history of this\r\nfine fellow would take up too much time just now; let it suffice to\r\nsay that Roustan is a thoroughbred barb from the Atlas mountains, and a\r\nBarbary horse is as good as an Arab. This one of mine will gallop up the\r\nmountain roads without turning a hair, and will never miss his footing\r\nin a canter along the brink of a precipice. He was a present to me, and\r\nI think that I deserved it, for in this way a father sought to repay\r\nme for his daughter’s life. She is one of the wealthiest heiresses in\r\nEurope, and she was at the brink of death when I found her on the road\r\nto Savoy. If I were to tell you how I cured that young lady, you would\r\ntake me for a quack. Aha! that is the sound of the bells on the horses\r\nand the rumbling of a wagon; it is coming along this way; let us see,\r\nperhaps that is Vigneau himself; and if so, take a good look at him!”\r\n\r\nIn another moment the officer saw a team of four huge horses, like those\r\nwhich are owned by prosperous farmers in Brie. The harness, the little\r\nbells, and the knots of braid in their manes, were clean and smart. The\r\ngreat wagon itself was painted bright blue, and perched aloft in it\r\nsat a stalwart, sunburned youth, who shouldered his whip like a gun and\r\nwhistled a tune.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Benassis, “that is only the wagoner. But see how the master’s\r\nprosperity in business is reflected by all his belongings, even by the\r\ncarter’s wagon! Is it not a sign of a capacity for business not very\r\noften met with in remote country places?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, it all looks very smart indeed,” the officer answered.\r\n\r\n“Well, Vigneau has two more wagons and teams like that one, and he has a\r\nsmall pony besides for business purposes, for he does trade over a wide\r\narea. And only four years ago he had nothing in the world! Stay, that is\r\na mistake--he had some debts. But let us go in.”\r\n\r\n“Is Mme. Vigneau in the house?” Benassis asked of the young wagoner.\r\n\r\n“She is out in the garden, sir; I saw her just now by the hedge down\r\nyonder; I will go and tell her that you are here.”\r\n\r\nGenestas followed Benassis across a wide open space with a hedge about\r\nit. In one corner various heaps of clay had been piled up, destined for\r\ntiles and pantiles, and a stack of brushwood and logs (fuel for the\r\nkiln no doubt) lay in another part of the enclosure. Farther away some\r\nworkmen were pounding chalk stones and tempering the clay in a space\r\nenclosed by hurdles. The tiles, both round and square, were made under\r\nthe great elms opposite the gateway, in a vast green arbor bounded by\r\nthe roofs of the drying-shed, and near this last the yawning mouth of\r\nthe kiln was visible. Some long-handled shovels lay about the worn cider\r\npath. A second row of buildings had been erected parallel with these.\r\nThere was a sufficiently wretched dwelling which housed the family, and\r\nsome outbuildings--sheds and stables and a barn. The cleanliness that\r\npredominated throughout, and the thorough repair in which everything was\r\nkept, spoke well for the vigilance of the master’s eyes. Some poultry\r\nand pigs wandered at large over the field.\r\n\r\n“Vigneau’s predecessor,” said Benassis, “was a good-for-nothing, a lazy\r\nrascal who cared about nothing by drink. He had been a workman himself;\r\nhe could keep a fire in his kiln and could put a price on his work, and\r\nthat was about all he knew; he had no energy, and no idea of business.\r\nIf no one came to buy his wares of him, they simply stayed on hand and\r\nwere spoiled, and so he lost the value of them. So he died of want at\r\nlast. He had ill-treated his wife till she was almost idiotic, and she\r\nlived in a state of abject wretchedness. It was so painful to see this\r\nlaziness and incurable stupidity, and I so much disliked the sight of\r\nthe tile-works, that I never came this way if I could help it. Luckily,\r\nboth the man and his wife were old people. One fine day the tile-maker\r\nhad a paralytic stroke, and I had him removed to the hospital at\r\nGrenoble at once. The owner of the tile-works agreed to take it over\r\nwithout disputing about its condition, and I looked round for new\r\ntenants who would take their part in improving the industries of the\r\ncanton.\r\n\r\n“Mme. Gravier’s waiting-maid had married a poor workman, who was earning\r\nso little with the potter who employed him that he could not support his\r\nhousehold. He listened to my advice, and actually had sufficient courage\r\nto take a lease of our tile-works, when he had not so much as a penny.\r\nHe came and took up his abode here, taught his wife, her aged mother,\r\nand his own mother how to make tiles, and made workmen of them. How they\r\nmanaged, I do not know, upon my honor! Vigneau probably borrowed fuel to\r\nheat his kiln, he certainly worked by day, and fetched in his materials\r\nin basket-loads by night; in short, no one knew what boundless energy\r\nhe brought to bear upon his enterprise; and the two old mothers, clad in\r\nrags, worked like negroes. In this way Vigneau contrived to fire several\r\nbatches, and lived for the first year on bread that was hardly won by\r\nthe toil of his household.\r\n\r\n“Still, he made a living. His courage, patience, and sterling worth\r\ninterested many people in him, and he began to be known. He was\r\nindefatigable. He would hurry over to Grenoble in the morning, and sell\r\nhis bricks and tiles there; then he would return home about the middle\r\nof the day, and go back again to the town at night. He seemed to be in\r\nseveral places at once. Towards the end of the first year he took two\r\nlittle lads to help him. Seeing how things were, I lent him some\r\nmoney, and since then from year to year the fortunes of the family have\r\nsteadily improved. After the second year was over the two old mothers no\r\nlonger moulded bricks nor pounded stones; they looked after the little\r\ngardens, made the soup, mended the clothes, they did spinning in the\r\nevenings, and gathered firewood in the daytime; while the young wife,\r\nwho can read and write, kept the accounts. Vigneau had a small horse,\r\nand rode on his business errands about the neighborhood; next he\r\nthoroughly studied the art of brick and tile making, discovering how to\r\nmake excellent square white paving-tiles, and sold them for less than\r\nthe usual prices. In the third year he had a cart and a pair of horses,\r\nand at the same time his wife’s appearance became almost elegant.\r\nEverything about his household improved with the improvement in his\r\nbusiness, and everywhere there was the same neatness, method, and thrift\r\nthat had been the making of his little fortune.\r\n\r\n“At last he had work enough for six men, to whom he pays good wages; he\r\nemploys a wagoner, and everything about him wears an air of prosperity.\r\nLittle by little, in short, by dint of taking pains and extending his\r\nbusiness, his income has increased. He bought the tile-works last year,\r\nand next year he will rebuild his house. To-day all the worthy folk\r\nthere are well clothed and in good health. His wife, who used to be so\r\nthin and pale when the burden of her husband’s cares and anxieties used\r\nto press so hardly upon her, has recovered her good looks, and has grown\r\nquite young and pretty again. The two old mothers are thoroughly happy,\r\nand take the deepest interest in every detail of the housekeeping or of\r\nthe business. Work has brought money, and the money that brought freedom\r\nfrom care brought health and plenty and happiness. The story of this\r\nhousehold is a living history in miniature of the Commune since I have\r\nknown it, and of all young industrial states. The tile factory that\r\nused to look so empty, melancholy, ill-kept, and useless, is now in full\r\nwork, astir with life, and well stocked with everything required. There\r\nis a good stock of wood here, and all the raw material for the season’s\r\nwork: for, as you know, tiles can only be made during a few months in\r\nthe year, between June and September. Is it not a pleasure to see all\r\nthis activity? My tile-maker has done his share of the work in every\r\nbuilding going, always busy--‘the devourer,’ they call him in these\r\nparts.”\r\n\r\nBenassis had scarcely finished speaking when the wicket gate which\r\ngave entrance to the garden opened, and a nicely-dressed young woman\r\nappeared. She came forward as quickly as her condition allowed, though\r\nthe two horsemen hastened towards her. Her attire somewhat recalled her\r\nformer quality of ladies’ maid, for she wore a pretty cap, a pink\r\ndress, a silk apron, and white stockings. Mme. Vigneau in short, was\r\na nice-looking woman, sufficiently plump, and if she was somewhat\r\nsunburned, her natural complexion must have been very fair. There were\r\na few lines still left on her forehead, traced there by the troubles\r\nof past days, but she had a bright and winsome face. She spoke in a\r\npersuasive voice, as she saw that the doctor came no further, “Will\r\nyou not do me the honor of coming inside and resting for a moment, M.\r\nBenassis?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly we will. Come this way, captain.”\r\n\r\n“The gentleman must be very hot! Will you take a little milk or some\r\nwine? M. Benassis, please try a little of the wine that my husband has\r\nbeen so kind as to buy for my confinement. You will tell me if it is\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“You have a good man for your husband.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” she turned and spoke in quiet tones, “I am very well off.”\r\n\r\n“We will not take anything, Mme. Vigneau; I only came round this way to\r\nsee that nothing troublesome had happened.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” she said. “I was busy out in the garden, as you saw, turning\r\nthe soil over for the sake of something to do.”\r\n\r\nThen the two old mothers came out to speak to Benassis, and the young\r\nwagoner planted himself in the middle of the yard, in a spot from whence\r\nhe could have a good view of the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Let us see, let me have your hand,” said Benassis, addressing Mme.\r\nVigneau; and as he carefully felt her pulse, he stood in silence,\r\nabsorbed in thought. The three women, meanwhile, scrutinized the\r\ncommandant with the undisguised curiosity that country people do not\r\nscruple to express.\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be better!” cried the doctor cheerily.\r\n\r\n“Will she be confined soon?” both the mothers asked together.\r\n\r\n“This week beyond a doubt. Is Vigneau away from home?” he asked, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” the young wife answered; “he is hurrying about settling\r\nhis business affairs, so as to be able to stay at home during my\r\nconfinement, the dear man!”\r\n\r\n“Well, my children, go on and prosper; continue to increase your wealth\r\nand to add to your family.”\r\n\r\nThe cleanliness of the almost ruinous dwelling filled Genestas with\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nBenassis saw the officer’s astonishment, and said, “There is no one like\r\nMme. Vigneau for keeping a house clean and tidy like this. I wish that\r\nseveral people in the town would come here to take a lesson.”\r\n\r\nThe tile-maker’s wife blushed and turned her head away; but the faces of\r\nthe two old mothers beamed with pleasure at the doctor’s words, and the\r\nthree women walked with them to the spot where the horses were waiting.\r\n\r\n“Well, now,” the doctor said to the two old women, “here is happiness\r\nfor you both! Were you not longing to be grandmothers?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not talk about it,” said the young wife; “they will drive me\r\ncrazy among them. My two mothers wish for a boy, and my husband would\r\nlike to have a little girl. It will be very difficult to please them\r\nall, I think.”\r\n\r\n“But you yourself,” asked Benassis; “what is your wish?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir, I wish for a child of my own.”\r\n\r\n“There! She is a mother already, you see,” said the doctor to the\r\nofficer, as he laid his hand on the bridle of his horse.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, M. Benassis; my husband will be sadly disappointed to learn\r\nthat you have been here when he was not at home to see you.”\r\n\r\n“He has not forgotten to send the thousand tiles to the\r\nGrange-aux-Belles for me?”\r\n\r\n“You know quite well, sir, that he would keep all the orders in the\r\ncanton waiting to serve you. Why, taking your money is the thing that\r\ntroubles him most; but I always tell him that your crowns bring luck\r\nwith them, and so they do.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Benassis.\r\n\r\nA little group gathered about the bars across the entrance to the\r\ntile-works. The three women, the young wagoner, and two workmen who had\r\nleft off work to greet the doctor, lingered there to have the pleasure\r\nof being with him until the last moment, as we are wont to linger with\r\nthose we love. The promptings of men’s hearts must everywhere be the\r\nsame, and in every land friendship expresses itself in the same gracious\r\nways.\r\n\r\nBenassis looked at the height of the sun and spoke to his companion:\r\n\r\n“There are still two hours of daylight left; and if you are not too\r\nhungry, we will go to see some one with whom I nearly always spend the\r\ninterval between the last of my visits and the hour for dinner. She is\r\na charming girl whom every one here calls my ‘good friend.’ That is\r\nthe name that they usually give to an affianced bride; but you must not\r\nimagine that there is the slightest imputation of any kind implied or\r\nintended by the use of the word in this case. Poor child, the care\r\nthat I have taken of her has, as may be imagined, made her an object\r\nof jealousy, but the general opinion entertained as to my character\r\nhas prevented any spiteful gossip. If no one understands the apparent\r\ncaprice that has led me to make an allowance to La Fosseuse, so that she\r\ncan live without being compelled to work, nobody has any doubts as to\r\nher character. I have watched over her with friendly care, and every one\r\nknows that I should never hesitate to marry her if my affection for her\r\nexceeded the limits of friendship. But no woman exists for me here in\r\nthe canton or anywhere else,” said the doctor, forcing a smile. “Some\r\nnatures feel a tyrannous need to attach themselves to some one thing\r\nor being which they single out from among the beings and things around\r\nthem; this need is felt most keenly by a man of quick sympathies, and\r\nall the more pressingly if his life has been made desolate. So, trust\r\nme, it is a favorable sign if a man is strongly attached to his dog\r\nor his horse! Among the suffering flock which chance has given into my\r\ncare, this poor little sufferer has come to be for me like the pet\r\nlamb that the shepherd lasses deck with ribbons in my own sunny land of\r\nLanguedoc; they talk to it and allow it to find pasture by the side\r\nof the cornfields, and its leisurely pace is never hurried by the\r\nshepherd’s dog.”\r\n\r\nBenassis stood with his hand on his horse’s mane as he spoke, ready to\r\nspring into the saddle, but making no effort to do so, as though the\r\nthoughts that stirred in him were but little in keeping with rapid\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n“Let us go,” he said at last; “come with me and pay her a visit. I am\r\ntaking you to see her; does not that tell you that I treat her as a\r\nsister?”\r\n\r\nAs they rode on their way again, Genestas said to the doctor, “Will\r\nyou regard it as inquisitiveness on my part if I ask to hear more of La\r\nFosseuse? I have come to know the story of many lives through you, and\r\nhers cannot be less interesting than some of these.”\r\n\r\nBenassis stopped his horse as he answered. “Perhaps you will not share\r\nin the feelings of interest awakened in me by La Fosseuse. Her fate\r\nis like my own; we have both alike missed our vocation; it is the\r\nsimilarity of our lots that occasions my sympathy for her and the\r\nfeelings that I experience at the sight of her. You either followed\r\nyour natural bent when you entered upon a military career, or you took\r\na liking for your calling after you had adopted it, otherwise you would\r\nnot have borne the heavy yoke of military discipline till now; you,\r\ntherefore, cannot understand the sorrows of a soul that must always feel\r\nrenewed within it the stir of longings that can never be realized; nor\r\nthe pining existence of a creature forced to live in an alien sphere.\r\nSuch sufferings as these are known only to these natures and to God who\r\nsends their afflictions, for they alone can know how deeply the events\r\nof life affect them. You yourself have seen the miseries produced by\r\nlong wars, till they have almost ceased to impress you, but have you\r\nnever detected a trace of sadness in your mind at the sight of a tree\r\nbearing sere leaves in the midst of spring, some tree that is pining and\r\ndying because it has been planted in soil in which it could not find the\r\nsustenance required for its full development? Ever since my twentieth\r\nyear, there has been something painful and melancholy for me about the\r\ndrooping of a stunted plant, and now I cannot bear the sight and turn my\r\nhead away. My youthful sorrow was a vague presentiment of the sorrows of\r\nmy later life; it was a kind of sympathy between my present and a future\r\ndimly foreshadowed by the life of the tree that before its time was\r\ngoing the way of all trees and men.”\r\n\r\n“I thought that you had suffered when I saw how kind you were.”\r\n\r\n“You see, sir,” the doctor went on without any reply to the remark made\r\nby Genestas, “that to speak of La Fosseuse is to speak of myself. La\r\nFosseuse is a plant in an alien soil; a human plant moreover, consumed\r\nby sad thoughts that have their source in the depths of her nature, and\r\nthat never cease to multiply. The poor girl is never well and strong.\r\nThe soul within her kills the body. This fragile creature was suffering\r\nfrom the sorest of all troubles, a trouble which receives the least\r\npossible sympathy from our selfish world, and how could I look on with\r\nindifferent eyes? for I, a man, strong to wrestle with pain, was nightly\r\ntempted to refuse to bear the burden of a sorrow like hers. Perhaps I\r\nmight actually have refused to bear it but for a thought of religion\r\nwhich soothes my impatience and fills my heart with sweet illusions.\r\nEven if we were not children of the same Father in heaven, La Fosseuse\r\nwould still be my sister in suffering!”\r\n\r\nBenassis pressed his knees against his horse’s sides, and swept ahead of\r\nCommandant Genestas, as if he shrank from continuing this conversation\r\nany further. When their horses were once more cantering abreast of each\r\nother, he spoke again: “Nature has created this poor girl for sorrow,”\r\n he said, “as she has created other women for joy. It is impossible to\r\ndo otherwise than believe in a future life at the sight of natures thus\r\npredestined to suffer. La Fosseuse is sensitive and highly strung. If\r\nthe weather is dark and cloudy, she is depressed; she ‘weeps when the\r\nsky is weeping,’ a phrase of her own; she sings with the birds; she\r\ngrows happy and serene under a cloudless sky; the loveliness of a bright\r\nday passes into her face; a soft sweet perfume is an inexhaustible\r\npleasure to her; I have seen her take delight the whole day long in the\r\nscent breathed forth by some mignonette; and, after one of those\r\nrainy mornings that bring out all the soul of the flowers and give\r\nindescribable freshness and brightness to the day, she seems to overflow\r\nwith gladness like the green world around her. If it is close and hot,\r\nand there is thunder in the air, La Fosseuse feels a vague trouble\r\nthat nothing can soothe. She lies on her bed, complains of numberless\r\ndifferent ills, and does not know what ails her. In answer to my\r\nquestions, she tells me that her bones are melting, that she is\r\ndissolving into water; her ‘heart has left her,’ to quote another of her\r\nsayings.\r\n\r\n“I have sometimes come upon the poor child suddenly and found her in\r\ntears, as she gazed at the sunset effects we sometimes see here among\r\nour mountains, when bright masses of cloud gather and crowd together\r\nand pile themselves above the golden peaks of the hills. ‘Why are you\r\ncrying, little one?’ I have asked her. ‘I do not know, sir,’ has been\r\nthe answer; ‘I have grown so stupid with looking up there; I have looked\r\nand looked, till I hardly know where I am.’ ‘But what do you see there?’\r\n‘I cannot tell you, sir,’ and you might question her in this way all the\r\nevening, yet you would never draw a word from her; but she would look at\r\nyou, and every glance would seem full of thoughts, or she would sit with\r\ntears in her eyes, scarcely saying a word, apparently rapt in musing.\r\nThose musings of hers are so profound that you fall under the spell of\r\nthem; on me, at least, she has the effect of a cloud overcharged with\r\nelectricity. One day I plied her with questions; I tried with all my\r\nmight to make her talk; at last I let fall a few rather hasty words;\r\nand, well--she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“At other times La Fosseuse is bright and winning, active, merry, and\r\nsprightly; she enjoys talking, and the ideas which she expresses\r\nare fresh and original. She is however quite unable to apply herself\r\nsteadily to any kind of work. When she was out in the fields she used to\r\nspend whole hours in looking at a flower, in watching the water flow, in\r\ngazing at the wonders in the depths of the clear, still river pools, at\r\nthe picturesque mosaic made up of pebbles and earth and sand, of water\r\nplants and green moss, and the brown soil washed down by the stream,\r\na deposit full of soft shades of color, and of hues that contrast\r\nstrangely with each other.\r\n\r\n“When I first came to the district the poor girl was starving. It hurt\r\nher pride to accept the bread of others; and it was only when driven to\r\nthe last extremity of want and suffering that she could bring herself to\r\nask for charity. The feeling that this was a disgrace would often give\r\nher energy, and for several days she worked in the fields; but her\r\nstrength was soon exhausted, and illness obliged her to leave the work\r\nthat she had begun. She had scarcely recovered when she went to a farm\r\non the outskirts of the town and asked to be taken on to look after the\r\ncattle; she did her work well and intelligently, but after a while she\r\nleft without giving any reason for so doing. The constant toil, day\r\nafter day, was no doubt too heavy a yoke for one who is all independence\r\nand caprice. Then she set herself to look for mushrooms or for truffles,\r\ngoing over to Grenoble to sell them. But the gaudy trifles in the town\r\nwere very tempting, the few small coins in her hand seemed to be great\r\nriches; she would forget her poverty and buy ribbons and finery, without\r\na thought for tomorrow’s bread. But if some other girl here in the\r\ntown took a fancy to her brass crucifix, her agate heart or her velvet\r\nribbon, she would make them over to her at once, glad to give happiness,\r\nfor she lives by generous impulses. So La Fosseuse was loved and pitied\r\nand despised by turns. Everything in her nature was a cause of suffering\r\nto her--her indolence, her kindness of heart, her coquetry; for she is\r\ncoquettish, dainty, and inquisitive, in short, she is a woman; she is as\r\nsimple as a child, and, like a child, she is carried away by her\r\ntastes and her impressions. If you tell her about some noble deed, she\r\ntrembles, her color rises, her heart throbs fast, and she sheds tears of\r\njoy; if you begin a story about robbers, she turns pale with terror.\r\nYou could not find a more sincere, open-hearted, and scrupulously loyal\r\nnature anywhere; if you were to give a hundred gold pieces into her\r\nkeeping, she would bury them in some out-of-the-way nook and beg her\r\nbread as before.”\r\n\r\nThere was a change in Benassis’ tone as he uttered these last words.\r\n\r\n“I once determined to put her to the proof,” he said, “and I repented\r\nof it. It is like espionage to bring a test to bear upon another, is it\r\nnot? It means that we suspect them at any rate.”\r\n\r\nHere the doctor paused, as though some inward reflection engrossed him;\r\nhe was quite unconscious of the embarrassment that his last remark had\r\ncaused to his companion, who busied himself with disentangling the reins\r\nin order to hide his confusion. Benassis soon resumed his talk.\r\n\r\n“I should like to find a husband for my Fosseuse. I should be glad to\r\nmake over one of my farms to some good fellow who would make her\r\nhappy. And she would be happy. The poor girl would love her children\r\nto distraction; for motherhood, which develops the whole of a woman’s\r\nnature, would give full scope to her overflowing sentiments. She has\r\nnever cared for any one, however. Yet her impressionable nature is\r\na danger to her. She knows this herself, and when she saw that I\r\nrecognized it, she admitted the excitability of her temperament to me.\r\nShe belongs to the small minority of women whom the slightest contact\r\nwith others causes to vibrate perilously; so that she must be made to\r\nvalue herself on her discretion and her womanly pride. She is as wild\r\nand shy as a swallow! Ah! what a wealth of kindness there is in her!\r\nNature meant her to be a rich woman; she would be so beneficent: for\r\na well-loved woman; she would be so faithful and true. She is only\r\ntwenty-two years old, and is sinking already beneath the weight of her\r\nsoul; a victim to highly-strung nerves, to an organization either too\r\ndelicate or too full of power. A passionate love for a faithless lover\r\nwould drive her mad, my poor Fosseuse! I have made a study of her\r\ntemperament, recognized the reality of her prolonged nervous attacks,\r\nand of the swift mysterious recurrence of her uplifted moods. I found\r\nthat they were immediately dependent on atmospheric changes and on the\r\nvariations of the moon, a fact which I have carefully verified; and\r\nsince then I have cared for her, as a creature unlike all others, for\r\nshe is a being whose ailing existence I alone can understand. As I\r\nhave told you, she is the pet lamb. But you shall see her; this is her\r\ncottage.”\r\n\r\nThey had come about one-third of the way up the mountain side. Low\r\nbushes grew on either hand along the steep paths which they were\r\nascending at a foot pace. At last, at a turn in one of the paths,\r\nGenestas saw La Fosseuse’s dwelling, which stood on one of the largest\r\nknolls on the mountain. Around it was a green sloping space of lawn\r\nabout three acres in extent, planted with trees, and surrounded by a\r\nwall high enough to serve as a fence, but not so high as to shut out the\r\nview of the landscape. Several rivulets that had their source in this\r\ngarden formed little cascades among the trees. The brick-built cottage\r\nwith a low roof that projected several feet was a charming detail in the\r\nlandscape. It consisted of a ground floor and a single story, and stood\r\nfacing the south. All the windows were in the front of the house, for\r\nits small size and lack of depth from back to front made other openings\r\nunnecessary. The doors and shutters were painted green, and the\r\nunderside of the penthouses had been lined with deal boards in the\r\nGerman fashion, and painted white. The rustic charm of the whole little\r\ndwelling lay in its spotless cleanliness.\r\n\r\nClimbing plants and briar roses grew about the house; a great walnut\r\ntree had been allowed to remain among the flowering acacias and trees\r\nthat bore sweet-scented blossoms, and a few weeping willows had been\r\nset by the little streams in the garden space. A thick belt of pines and\r\nbeeches grew behind the house, so that the picturesque little dwelling\r\nwas brought out into strong relief by the sombre width of background.\r\nAt that hour of the day, the air was fragrant with the scents from the\r\nhillsides and the perfume from La Fosseuse’s garden. The sky overhead\r\nwas clear and serene, but low clouds hung on the horizon, and the\r\nfar-off peaks had begun to take the deep rose hues that the sunset often\r\nbrings. At the height which they had reached the whole valley lay before\r\ntheir eyes, from distant Grenoble to the little lake at the foot of the\r\ncircle of crags by which Genestas had passed on the previous day. Some\r\nlittle distance above the house a line of poplars on the hill indicated\r\nthe highway that led to Grenoble. Rays of sunlight fell slantwise across\r\nthe little town which glittered like a diamond, for the soft red light\r\nwhich poured over it like a flood was reflected by all its window-panes.\r\nGenestas reined in his horse at the sight, and pointed to the dwellings\r\nin the valley, to the new town, and to La Fosseuse’s house.\r\n\r\n“Since the victory of Wagram, and Napoleon’s return to the Tuileries in\r\n1815,” he said, with a sigh, “nothing has so stirred me as the sight of\r\nall this. I owe this pleasure to you, sir, for you have taught me to see\r\nbeauty in a landscape.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the doctor, smiling as he spoke, “It is better to build\r\ntowns than to storm them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! sir, how about the taking of Moscow and the surrender of Mantua!\r\nWhy, you do not really know what that means! Is it not a glory for all\r\nof us? You are a good man, but Napoleon also was a good man. If it had\r\nnot been for England, you both would have understood each other, and\r\nour Emperor would never have fallen. There are no spies here,” said the\r\nofficer, looking around him, “and I can say openly that I love him, now\r\nthat he is dead! What a ruler! He knew every man when he saw him!\r\nHe would have made you a Councillor of State, for he was a great\r\nadministrator himself; even to the point of knowing how many cartridges\r\nwere left in the men’s boxes after an action. Poor man! While you were\r\ntalking about La Fosseuse, I thought of him, and how he was lying dead\r\nin St. Helena! Was that the kind of climate and country to suit _him_,\r\nwhose seat had been a throne, and who had lived with his feet in the\r\nstirrups; hein? They say that he used to work in the garden. The\r\ndeuce! He was not made to plant cabbages.... And now we must serve the\r\nBourbons, and loyally, sir; for, after all, France is France, as you\r\nwere saying yesterday.”\r\n\r\nGenestas dismounted as he uttered these last words, and mechanically\r\nfollowed the example set by Benassis, who fastened his horse’s bridle to\r\na tree.\r\n\r\n“Can she be away?” said the doctor, when he did not see La Fosseuse on\r\nthe threshold. They went into the house, but there was no one in the\r\nsitting room on the ground floor.\r\n\r\n“She must have heard the sound of a second horse,” said Benassis, with\r\na smile, “and has gone upstairs to put on her cap, or her sash, or some\r\npiece of finery.”\r\n\r\nHe left Genestas alone, and went upstairs in search of La Fosseuse.\r\nThe commandant made a survey of the room. He noticed the pattern of the\r\npaper that covered the walls--roses scattered over a gray background,\r\nand the straw matting that did duty for a carpet on the floor. The\r\narmchair, the table, and the smaller chairs were made of wood from which\r\nthe bark had not been removed. The room was not without ornament; some\r\nflower-stands, as they might be called, made of osiers and wooden hoops,\r\nhad been filled with moss and flowers, and the windows were draped by\r\nwhite dimity curtains bordered with a scarlet fringe. There was a mirror\r\nabove the chimney-piece, where a plain china jar stood between two\r\ncandlesticks. Some calico lay on the table; shirts, apparently, had\r\nbeen cut out and begun, several pairs of gussets were finished, and\r\na work-basket, scissors, needles and thread, and all a needle-woman’s\r\nrequirements lay beside them. Everything was as fresh and clean as\r\na shell that the sea had tossed up on the beach. Genestas saw that a\r\nkitchen lay on the other side of the passage, and that the staircase\r\nwas at the further end of it. The upper story, like the ground floor,\r\nevidently consisted of two rooms only. “Come, do not be frightened,”\r\n Benassis was saying to La Fosseuse; “come down-stairs!”\r\n\r\nGenestas promptly retreated into the sitting-room when he heard these\r\nwords, and in another moment a slender girl, well and gracefully made,\r\nappeared in the doorway. She wore a gown of cambric, covered with narrow\r\npink stripes, and cut low at the throat, so as to display a muslin\r\nchemisette. Shyness and timidity had brought the color to a face which\r\nhad nothing very remarkable about it save a certain flatness of feature\r\nwhich called to mind the Cossack and Russian countenances that since\r\nthe disasters of 1814 have unfortunately come to be so widely known in\r\nFrance. La Fosseuse was, in fact, very like these men of the North. Her\r\nnose turned up at the end, and was sunk in her face, her mouth was wide\r\nand her chin small, her hands and arms were red and, like her feet, were\r\nof the peasant type, large and strong. Although she had been used to an\r\noutdoor life, to exposure to the sun and the scorching summer winds, her\r\ncomplexion had the bleached look of withered grass; but after the first\r\nglance this made her face more interesting, and there was such a sweet\r\nexpression in her blue eyes, so much grace about her movements, and such\r\nmusic in her voice, that little as her features seemed to harmonize\r\nwith the disposition which Benassis had praised to the commandant, the\r\nofficer recognized in her the capricious and ailing creature, condemned\r\nto suffering by a nature that had been thwarted in its growth.\r\n\r\nLa Fosseuse deftly stirred the fire of dry branches and turfs of peat,\r\nthen sat down in an armchair and took up one of the shirts that she had\r\nbegun. She sat there under the officer’s eyes, half bashful, afraid to\r\nlook up, and calm to all appearance; but her bodice rose and fell\r\nwith the rapid breathing that betrayed her nervousness, and it struck\r\nGenestas that her figure was very graceful.\r\n\r\n“Well, my poor child, is your work going on nicely?” said Benassis,\r\ntaking up the material intended for the shirts, and passing it through\r\nhis fingers.\r\n\r\nLa Fosseuse gave the doctor a timid and beseeching glance.\r\n\r\n“Do not scold me, sir,” she entreated; “I have not touched them to-day,\r\nalthough they were ordered by you, and for people who need them very\r\nbadly. But the weather has been so fine! I wandered out and picked\r\na quantity of mushrooms and white truffles, and took them over to\r\nJacquotte; she was very pleased, for some people are coming to dinner.\r\nI was so glad that I thought of it; something seemed to tell me to go to\r\nlook for them.”\r\n\r\nShe began to ply her needle again.\r\n\r\n“You have a very pretty house here, mademoiselle,” said Genestas,\r\naddressing her.\r\n\r\n“It is not mine at all, sir,” she said, looking at the stranger, and her\r\neyes seemed to grow red and tearful; “it belongs to M. Benassis,” and\r\nshe turned towards the doctor with a gentle expression on her face.\r\n\r\n“You know quite well, my child, that you will never have to leave it,”\r\n he said, as he took her hand in his.\r\n\r\nLa Fosseuse suddenly rose and left the room.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the doctor, addressing the officer, “what do you think of\r\nher?”\r\n\r\n“There is something strangely touching about her,” Genestas answered.\r\n“How very nicely you have fitted up this little nest of hers!”\r\n\r\n“Bah! a wall-paper at fifteen or twenty sous; it was carefully chosen,\r\nbut that was all. The furniture is nothing very much either, my\r\nbasket-maker made it for me; he wanted to show his gratitude; and La\r\nFosseuse made the curtains herself out of a few yards of calico. This\r\nlittle house of hers, and her simple furniture, seem pretty to you,\r\nbecause you come upon them up here on a hillside in a forlorn part of\r\nthe world where you did not expect to find things clean and tidy. The\r\nreason of the prettiness is a kind of harmony between the little house\r\nand its surroundings. Nature has set picturesque groups of trees and\r\nrunning streams about it, and has scattered her fairest flowers among\r\nthe grass, her sweet-scented wild strawberry blossoms, and her lovely\r\nviolets.... Well, what is the matter?” asked Benassis, as La Fosseuse\r\ncame back to them.\r\n\r\n“Oh! nothing, nothing,” she answered. “I fancied that one of my chickens\r\nwas missing, and had not been shut up.”\r\n\r\nHer remark was disingenuous, but this was only noticed by the doctor,\r\nwho said in her ear, “You have been crying!”\r\n\r\n“Why do you say things like that to me before some one else?” she asked\r\nin reply.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said Genestas, “it is a great pity that you live here\r\nall by yourself; you ought to have a mate in such a charming cage as\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” she said, “but what would you have? I am poor, and I\r\nam hard to please. I feel that it would not suit me at all to carry the\r\nsoup out into the fields, nor to push a hand-cart; to feel the misery\r\nof those whom I should love, and have no power to put an end to it; to\r\ncarry my children in my arms all day, and patch and re-patch a man’s\r\nrags. The cure tells me that such thoughts as these are not very\r\nChristian; I know that myself, but how can I help it? There are days\r\nwhen I would rather eat a morsel of dry bread than cook anything for\r\nmy dinner. Why would you have me worry some man’s life out with my\r\nfailings? He would perhaps work himself to death to satisfy my whims,\r\nand that would not be right. Pshaw! an unlucky lot has fallen to me, and\r\nI ought to bear it by myself.”\r\n\r\n“And besides, she is a born do-nothing,” said Benassis. “We must take\r\nmy poor Fosseuse as we find her. But all that she has been saying to you\r\nsimply means that she has never loved as yet,” he added, smiling. Then\r\nhe rose and went out on to the lawn for a moment.\r\n\r\n“You must be very fond of M. Benassis?” asked Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, sir; and there are plenty of people hereabouts who feel as I\r\ndo--that they would be glad to do anything in the world for him. And yet\r\nhe who cures other people has some trouble of his own that nothing can\r\ncure. You are his friend, perhaps you know what it is? Who could have\r\ngiven pain to such a man, who is the very image of God on earth? I know\r\na great many who think that the corn grows faster if he has passed by\r\ntheir field in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I, sir? When I have seen him,” she seemed to hesitate, then she went\r\non, “I am happy all the rest of the day.”\r\n\r\nShe bent her head over her work, and plied her needle with unwonted\r\nswiftness.\r\n\r\n“Well, has the captain been telling you something about Napoleon?” said\r\nthe doctor, as he came in again.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the Emperor, sir?” cried La Fosseuse, gazing at the\r\nofficer’s face with eager curiosity.\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_” said Genestas, “hundreds of times!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! how I should like to know something about the army!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we will come to take a cup of coffee with you to-morrow, and\r\nyou shall hear ‘something about the army,’ dear child,” said Benassis,\r\nwho laid his hand on her shoulder and kissed her brow. “She is my\r\ndaughter, you see!” he added, turning to the commandant; “there is\r\nsomething wanting in the day, somehow, when I have not kissed her\r\nforehead.”\r\n\r\nLa Fosseuse held Benassis’ hand in a tight clasp as she murmured, “Oh!\r\nyou are very kind!”\r\n\r\nThey left the house; but she came after them to see them mount. She\r\nwaited till Genestas was in the saddle, and then whispered in Benassis’\r\near, “Tell me who that gentleman is?”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” said the doctor, putting a foot in the stirrup, “a husband for\r\nyou, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nShe stood on the spot where they left her, absorbed in watching their\r\nprogress down the steep path; and when they came past the end of the\r\ngarden, they saw her already perched on a little heap of stones, so that\r\nshe might still keep them in view and give them a last nod of farewell.\r\n\r\n“There is something very unusual about that girl, sir,” Genestas said to\r\nthe doctor when they had left the house far behind.\r\n\r\n“There is, is there not?” he answered. “Many a time I have said to\r\nmyself that she will make a charming wife, but I can only love her as a\r\nsister or a daughter, and in no other way; my heart is dead.”\r\n\r\n“Has she any relations?” asked Genestas. “What did her father and mother\r\ndo?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it is quite a long story,” answered Benassis. “Neither her father\r\nnor mother nor any of her relations are living. Everything about her\r\ndown to her name interested me. La Fosseuse was born here in the town.\r\nHer father, a laborer from Saint Laurent du Pont, was nicknamed _Le\r\nFosseur_, which is no doubt a contraction of _fossoyeur_, for the\r\noffice of sexton had been in his family time out of mind. All the sad\r\nassociations of the graveyard hang about the name. Here as in some other\r\nparts of France, there is an old custom, dating from the times of the\r\nLatin civilization, in virtue of which a woman takes her husband’s name,\r\nwith the addition of a feminine termination, and this girl has been\r\ncalled La Fosseuse, after her father.\r\n\r\n“The laborer had married the waiting-woman of some countess or other\r\nwho owns an estate at a distance of a few leagues. It was a love-match.\r\nHere, as in all country districts, love is a very small element in\r\na marriage. The peasant, as a rule, wants a wife who will bear him\r\nchildren, a housewife who will make good soup and take it out to him in\r\nthe fields, who will spin and make his shirts and mend his clothes. Such\r\na thing had not happened for a long while in a district where a young\r\nman not unfrequently leaves his betrothed for another girl who is richer\r\nby three or four acres of land. The fate of Le Fosseur and his wife\r\nwas scarcely happy enough to induce our Dauphinois to forsake their\r\ncalculating habits and practical way of regarding things. La Fosseuse,\r\nwho was a very pretty woman, died when her daughter was born, and her\r\nhusband’s grief for his loss was so great that he followed her within\r\nthe year, leaving nothing in the world to this little one except an\r\nexistence whose continuance was very doubtful--a mere feeble flicker of\r\na life. A charitable neighbor took the care of the baby upon herself,\r\nand brought her up till she was nine years old. Then the burden of\r\nsupporting La Fosseuse became too heavy for the good woman; so at the\r\ntime of year when travelers are passing along the roads, she sent her\r\ncharge to beg for her living upon the highways.\r\n\r\n“One day the little orphan asked for bread at the countess’ chateau, and\r\nthey kept the child for her mother’s sake. She was to be waiting-maid\r\nsome day to the daughter of the house, and was brought up to this end.\r\nHer young mistress was married five years later; but meanwhile the poor\r\nlittle thing was the victim of all the caprices of wealthy people, whose\r\nbeneficence for the most part is not to be depended upon even while\r\nit lasts. They are generous by fits and starts--sometimes patrons,\r\nsometimes friends, sometimes masters, in this way they falsify the\r\nalready false position of the poor children in whom they interest\r\nthemselves, and trifle with the hearts, the lives, and futures of their\r\nprotegees, whom they regard very lightly. From the first La Fosseuse\r\nbecame almost a companion to the young heiress; she was taught to read\r\nand write, and her future mistress sometimes amused herself by giving\r\nher music lessons. She was treated sometimes as a lady’s companion,\r\nsometimes as a waiting-maid, and in this way they made an incomplete\r\nbeing of her. She acquired a taste for luxury and for dress, together\r\nwith manners ill-suited to her real position. She has been roughly\r\nschooled by misfortune since then, but the vague feeling that she is\r\ndestined for a higher lot has not been effaced in her.\r\n\r\n“A day came at last, however, a fateful day for the poor girl, when the\r\nyoung countess (who was married by this time) discovered La Fosseuse\r\narrayed in one of her ball dresses, and dancing before a mirror. La\r\nFosseuse was no longer anything but a waiting-maid, and the orphan girl,\r\nthen sixteen years of age, was dismissed without pity. Her idle ways\r\nplunged her once more into poverty; she wandered about begging by the\r\nroadside, and working at times as I have told you. Sometimes she thought\r\nof drowning herself, sometimes also of giving herself to the first\r\ncomer; she spent most of her time thinking dark thoughts, lying by\r\nthe side of a wall in the sun, with her face buried in the grass, and\r\npassers-by would sometimes throw a few halfpence to her, simply because\r\nshe asked them for nothing. One whole year she spent in a hospital at\r\nAnnecy after heavy toil in the harvest field; she had only undertaken\r\nthe work in the hope that it would kill her, and that so she might die.\r\nYou should hear her herself when she speaks of her feelings and ideas\r\nduring this time of her life; her simple confidences are often very\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\n“She came back to the little town at last, just about the time when I\r\ndecided to take up my abode in it. I wanted to understand the minds of\r\nthe people beneath my rule; her character struck me, and I made a\r\nstudy of it; then when I became aware of her physical infirmities, I\r\ndetermined to watch over her. Perhaps in time she may grow accustomed to\r\nwork with her needle, but, whatever happens, I have secured her future.”\r\n\r\n“She is quite alone up there!” said Genestas.\r\n\r\n“No. One of my herdswomen sleeps in the house,” the doctor answered.\r\n“You did not see my farm buildings which lie behind the house. They are\r\nhidden by the pine-trees. Oh! she is quite safe. Moreover, there are no\r\nmauvais sujets here in the valley; if any come among us by any chance, I\r\nsend them into the army, where they make excellent solders.”\r\n\r\n“Poor girl!” said Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the folk round about do not pity her at all,” said Benassis; “on\r\nthe other hand, they think her very lucky; but there is this difference\r\nbetween her and the other women: God has given strength to them and\r\nweakness to her, and they do not see that.”\r\n\r\nThe moment that the two horsemen came out upon the road to Grenoble,\r\nBenassis stopped with an air of satisfaction; a different view had\r\nsuddenly opened out before them; he foresaw its effect upon Genestas,\r\nand wished to enjoy his surprise. As far as the eye could see, two green\r\nwalls sixty feet high rose above a road which was rounded like a garden\r\npath. The trees had not been cut or trimmed, each one preserved the\r\nmagnificent palm-branch shape that makes the Lombard poplar one of the\r\ngrandest of trees; there they stood, a natural monument which a man\r\nmight well be proud of having reared. The shadow had already reached one\r\nside of the road, transforming it into a vast wall of black leaves,\r\nbut the setting sun shone full upon the other side, which stood out in\r\ncontrast, for the young leaves at the tips of every branch had been\r\ndyed a bright golden hue, and, as the breeze stirred through the waving\r\ncurtain, it gleamed in the light.\r\n\r\n“You must be very happy here!” cried Genestas. “The sight of this must\r\nbe all pleasure to you.”\r\n\r\n“The love of Nature is the only love that does not deceive human hopes.\r\nThere is no disappointment here,” said the doctor. “Those poplars are\r\nten years old; have you ever seen any that are better grown than these\r\nof mine?”\r\n\r\n“God is great!” said the soldier, coming to a stand in the middle of the\r\nroad, of which he saw neither beginning nor end.\r\n\r\n“You do me good,” cried Benassis. “It was a pleasure to hear you say\r\nover again what I have so often said in the midst of this avenue. There\r\nis something holy about this place. Here, we are like two mere specks;\r\nand the feeling of our own littleness always brings us into the presence\r\nof God.”\r\n\r\nThey rode on slowly and in silence, listening to their horses’\r\nhoof-beats; the sound echoed along the green corridor as it might have\r\ndone beneath the vaulted roof of a cathedral.\r\n\r\n“How many things have a power to stir us which town-dwellers do not\r\nsuspect,” said the doctor. “Do you not notice the sweet scent given\r\noff by the gum of the poplar buds, and the resin of the larches? How\r\ndelightful it is!”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” exclaimed Genestas. “Let us wait a moment.”\r\n\r\nA distant sound of singing came to their ears.\r\n\r\n“Is it a woman or a man, or is it a bird?” asked the commandant in a low\r\nvoice. “Is it the voice of this wonderful landscape?”\r\n\r\n“It is something of all these things,” the doctor answered, as he\r\ndismounted and fastened his horse to a branch of a poplar tree.\r\n\r\nHe made a sign to the officer to follow his example and to come with\r\nhim. They went slowly along a footpath between two hedges of blossoming\r\nhawthorn which filled the damp evening air with its delicate fragrance.\r\nThe sun shone full into the pathway; the light and warmth were very\r\nperceptible after the shade thrown by the long wall of poplar trees; the\r\nstill powerful rays poured a flood of red light over a cottage at the\r\nend of the stony track. The ridge of the cottage roof was usually a\r\nbright green with its overgrowth of mosses and house-leeks, and the\r\nthatch was brown as a chestnut shell, but just now it seemed to be\r\npowdered with a golden dust. The cottage itself was scarcely visible\r\nthrough the haze of light; the ruinous wall, the doorway and everything\r\nabout it was radiant with a fleeting glory and a beauty due to chance,\r\nsuch as is sometimes seen for an instant in a human face, beneath the\r\ninfluence of a strong emotion that brings warmth and color into it. In\r\na life under the open sky and among the fields, the transient and tender\r\ngrace of such moments as these draws from us the wish of the apostle who\r\nsaid to Jesus Christ upon the mountain, “Let us build a tabernacle and\r\ndwell here.”\r\n\r\nThe wide landscape seemed at that moment to have found a voice whose\r\npurity, and sweetness equaled its own sweetness and purity, a voice as\r\nmournful as the dying light in the west--for a vague reminder of Death\r\nis divinely set in the heavens, and the sun above gives the same warning\r\nthat is given here on earth by the flowers and the bright insects of the\r\nday. There is a tinge of sadness about the radiance of sunset, and the\r\nmelody was sad. It was a song widely known in the days of yore, a ballad\r\nof love and sorrow that once had served to stir a national hatred of\r\nFrance for England. Beaumarchais, in a later day, had given it back its\r\ntrue poetry by adapting it for the French theatre and putting it into\r\nthe mouth of a page, who pours out his heart to his stepmother. Just\r\nnow it was simply the air that rose and fell. There were no words; the\r\nplaintive voice of the singer touched and thrilled the soul.\r\n\r\n“It is the swan’s song,” said Benassis. “That voice does not sound twice\r\nin a century for human ears. Let us hurry; we must put a stop to the\r\nsinging! The child is killing himself; it would be cruel to listen to\r\nhim any longer. Be quiet, Jacques! Come, come, be quiet!” cried the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nThe music ceased. Genestas stood motionless and overcome with\r\nastonishment. A cloud had drifted across the sun, the landscape and the\r\nvoice were both mute. Shadow, chillness, and silence had taken the place\r\nof the soft glory of the light, the warm breath of the breeze, and the\r\nchild’s singing.\r\n\r\n“What makes you disobey me?” asked Benassis. “I shall not bring you any\r\nmore rice pudding nor snail broth! No more fresh dates and white bread\r\nfor you! So you want to die and break your poor mother’s heart, do you?”\r\n\r\nGenestas came into a little yard, which was sufficiently clean and\r\ntidily kept, and saw before him a lad of fifteen, who looked as delicate\r\nas a woman. His hair was fair but scanty, and the color in his face\r\nwas so bright that it seemed hardly natural. He rose up slowly from the\r\nbench where he was sitting, beneath a thick bush of jessamine and some\r\nblossoming lilacs that were running riot, so that he was almost hidden\r\namong the leaves.\r\n\r\n“You know very well,” said the doctor, “that I told you not to talk, not\r\nto expose yourself to the chilly evening air, and to go to bed as soon\r\nas the sun was set. What put it into your head to sing?”\r\n\r\n“_Dame!_ M. Benassis, it was so very warm out here, and it is so nice\r\nto feel warm! I am always cold. I felt so happy that without thinking I\r\nbegan to try over _Malbrouk s’en va-t-en guerre_, just for fun, and\r\nthen I began to listen to myself because my voice was something like the\r\nsound of the flute your shepherd plays.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my poor Jacques, this must not happen again; do you hear? Let me\r\nhave your hand,” and the doctor felt his pulse.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s eyes had their usual sweet expression, but just now they shone\r\nwith a feverish light.\r\n\r\n“It is just as I thought, you are covered with perspiration,” said\r\nBenassis. “Your mother has not come in yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Come! go in-doors and get into bed.”\r\n\r\nThe young invalid went back into the cottage, followed by Benassis and\r\nthe officer.\r\n\r\n“Just light a candle, Captain Bluteau,” said the doctor, who was helping\r\nJacques to take off his rough, tattered clothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Genestas had struck a light, and the interior of the room was\r\nvisible, he was surprised by the extreme thinness of the child, who\r\nseemed to be little more than skin and bone. When the little peasant had\r\nbeen put to bed, Benassis tapped the lad’s chest, and listened to\r\nthe ominous sounds made in this way by his fingers; then, after some\r\ndeliberation, he drew back the coverlet over Jacques, stepped back a\r\nfew paces, folded his arms across his chest, and closely scrutinized his\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel, my little man?”\r\n\r\n“Quite comfortable, sir.”\r\n\r\nA table, with four spindle legs, stood in the room; the doctor drew\r\nit up to the bed, found a tumbler and a phial on the mantel-shelf, and\r\ncomposed a draught, by carefully measuring a few drops of brown liquid\r\nfrom the phial into some water, Genestas holding the light the while.\r\n\r\n“Your mother is very late.”\r\n\r\n“She is coming, sir,” said the child; “I can hear her footsteps on the\r\npath.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the officer looked around them while they waited. At the\r\nfoot of the bed there was a sort of mattress made of moss, on which,\r\ndoubtless, the mother was wont to sleep in her clothes, for there were\r\nneither sheets nor coverlet. Genestas pointed out this bed to Benassis,\r\nwho nodded slightly to show that he likewise had already admired this\r\nmotherly devotion. There was a clatter of sabots in the yard, and the\r\ndoctor went out.\r\n\r\n“You will have to sit up with Jacques to-night, Mother Colas. If he\r\ntells you that his breathing is bad, you must let him drink some of the\r\ndraught that I have poured into the tumbler on the table. Take care not\r\nto let him have more than two or three sips at a time; there ought to\r\nbe enough in the tumbler to last him all through the night. Above all\r\nthings, do not touch the phial, and change the child’s clothing at once.\r\nHe is perspiring heavily.”\r\n\r\n“I could not manage to wash his shirts to-day, sir; I had to take the\r\nhemp over to Grenoble, as we wanted the money.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, I will send you some shirts.”\r\n\r\n“Then is he worse, my poor lad?” asked the woman.\r\n\r\n“He has been so imprudent as to sing, Mother Colas; and it is not to be\r\nexpected that any good can come of it; but do not be hard upon him, nor\r\nscold him. Do not be down-hearted about it; and if Jacques complains\r\novermuch, send a neighbor to fetch me. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor called to his friend, and they went back along the foot-path.\r\n\r\n“Is that little peasant consumptive?” asked Genestas.\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu_! yes,” answered Benassis. “Science cannot save him, unless\r\nNature works a miracle. Our professors at the Ecole de Médecine in\r\nParis often used to speak to us of the phenomenon which you have\r\njust witnessed. Some maladies of this kind bring about changes in the\r\nvoice-producing organs that give the sufferer a short-lived power\r\nof song that no trained voice can surpass. I have made you spend a\r\nmelancholy day, sir,” said the doctor when he was once more in\r\nthe saddle. “Suffering and death everywhere, but everywhere also\r\nresignation. All these peasant folk take death philosophically; they\r\nfall ill, say nothing about it, and take to their beds like dumb\r\nanimals. But let us say no more about death, and let us quicken our\r\nhorses’ paces a little; we ought to reach the town before nightfall, so\r\nthat you may see the new quarter.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! some place is on fire over there,” said Genestas, pointing to a\r\nspot on the mountain, where a sheaf of flames was rising.\r\n\r\n“It is not a dangerous fire. Our lime-burner is heating his kiln,\r\nno doubt. It is a newly-started industry, which turns our heather to\r\naccount.”\r\n\r\nThere was the sudden report of a gun, followed by an involuntary\r\nexclamation from Benassis, who said, with an impatient gesture, “If that\r\nis Butifer, we shall see which of us two is the stronger.”\r\n\r\n“The shot came from that quarter,” said Genestas, indicating a\r\nbeech-wood up above them on the mountain side. “Yes, up there; you may\r\ntrust an old soldier’s ear.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go there at once!” cried Benassis, and he made straight for the\r\nlittle wood, urging his horse at a furious speed across the ditches and\r\nfields, as if he were riding a steeplechase, in his anxiety to catch the\r\nsportsman red-handed.\r\n\r\n“The man you are after has made off,” shouted Genestas, who could\r\nscarcely keep up with him.\r\n\r\nBenassis wheeled his horse round sharply, and came back again. The man\r\nof whom he was in search soon appeared on the top of a perpendicular\r\ncrag, a hundred feet above the level of the two horsemen.\r\n\r\n“Butifer!” shouted Benassis when he saw that this figure carried a\r\nfowling-piece; “come down!”\r\n\r\nButifer recognized the doctor, and replied by a respectful and friendly\r\nsign which showed that he had every intention of obeying.\r\n\r\n“I can imagine that if a man were driven to it by fear or by some\r\novermastering impulse that he might possibly contrive to scramble up to\r\nthat point among the rocks,” said Genestas; “but how will he manage to\r\ncome down again?”\r\n\r\n“I have no anxiety on that score,” answered Benassis; “the wild goats\r\nmust feel envious of that fellow yonder! You will see.”\r\n\r\nThe emergencies of warfare had accustomed the commandant to gauge the\r\nreal worth of men; he admired the wonderful quickness of Butifer’s\r\nmovements, the sure-footed grace with which the hunter swung himself\r\ndown the rugged sides of the crag, to the top of which he had so boldly\r\nclimbed. The strong, slender form of the mountaineer was gracefully\r\npoised in every attitude which the precipitous nature of the path\r\ncompelled him to assume; and so certain did he seem of his power to hold\r\non at need, that if the pinnacle of rock on which he took his stand had\r\nbeen a level floor, he could not have set his foot down upon it\r\nmore calmly. He carried his fowling-piece as if it had been a light\r\nwalking-cane. Butifer was a young man of middle height, thin, muscular,\r\nand in good training; his beauty was of a masculine order, which\r\nimpressed Genestas on a closer view.\r\n\r\nEvidently he belonged to the class of smugglers who ply their trade\r\nwithout resorting to violent courses, and who only exert patience and\r\ncraft to defraud the government. His face was manly and sunburned. His\r\neyes, which were bright as an eagle’s, were of a clear yellow color, and\r\nhis sharply-cut nose with its slight curve at the tip was very much like\r\nan eagle’s beak. His cheeks were covered with down, his red lips were\r\nhalf open, giving a glimpse of a set of teeth of dazzling whiteness. His\r\nbeard, moustache, and the reddish whiskers, which he allowed to grow,\r\nand which curled naturally, still further heightened the masculine\r\nand forbidding expression of his face. Everything about him spoke of\r\nstrength. He was broad-chested; constant activity had made the\r\nmuscles of his hands curiously firm and prominent. There was the\r\nquick intelligence of a savage about his glances; he looked resolute,\r\nfearless, and imperturbable, like a man accustomed to put his life in\r\nperil, and whose physical and mental strength had been so often tried by\r\ndangers of every kind, that he no longer felt any doubts about himself.\r\nHe wore a blouse that had suffered a good deal from thorns and briars,\r\nand he had a pair of leather soles bound to his feet by eel-skin thongs,\r\nand a pair of torn and tattered blue linen breeches through which his\r\nlegs were visible, red, wiry, hard, and muscular as those of a stag.\r\n\r\n“There you see the man who once fired a shot at me,” Benassis remarked\r\nto the commandant in a low voice. “If at this moment I were to signify\r\nto him my desire to be rid of any one, he would kill them without\r\nscruple.--Butifer!” he went on, addressing the poacher, “I fully\r\nbelieved you to be a man of your word; I pledged mine for you because I\r\nhad your promise. My promise to the _procureur du roi_ at Grenoble was\r\nbased upon your vow never to go poaching again, and to turn over a new\r\nleaf and become a steady, industrious worker. You fired that shot just\r\nnow, and here you are, on the Comte de Labranchoir’s estate! Eh! you\r\nmiscreant? Suppose his keeper had happened to hear you? It is a lucky\r\nthing for you that I shall take no formal cognizance of this offence; if\r\nI did, you would come up as an old offender, and of course you have no\r\ngun license! I let you keep that gun of yours out of tenderness for your\r\nattachment to the weapon.”\r\n\r\n“It is a beauty,” said the commandant, who recognized a duck gun from\r\nSainte Etienne.\r\n\r\nThe smuggler raised his head and looked at Genestas by way of\r\nacknowledging the compliment.\r\n\r\n“Butifer,” continued Benassis, “if your conscience does not reproach\r\nyou, it ought to do so. If you are going to begin your old tricks again,\r\nyou will find yourself once more in a park enclosed by four stone walls,\r\nand no power on earth will save you from the hulks; you will be a marked\r\nman, and your character will be ruined. Bring your gun to me to-night, I\r\nwill take care of it for you.”\r\n\r\nButifer gripped the barrel of his weapon in a convulsive clutch.\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir,” he said; “I have done wrong, I have broken bounds,\r\nI am a cur. My gun ought to go to you, but when you take it away from\r\nme, you take all that I have in the world. The last shot which my\r\nmother’s son will fire shall be through my own head.... What would you\r\nhave? I did as you wanted me. I kept quiet all winter; but the spring\r\ncame, and the sap rose. I am not used to day labor. It is not in my\r\nnature to spend my life in fattening fowls; I cannot stoop about turning\r\nover the soil for vegetables, nor flourish a whip and drive a cart, nor\r\nscrub down a horse in a stable all my life, so I must die of starvation,\r\nI suppose? I am only happy when I am up there,” he went on after a\r\npause, pointing to the mountains. “And I have been about among the hills\r\nfor the past week; I got a sight of a chamois, and I have the chamois\r\nthere,” he said, pointing to the top of the crag; “it is at your\r\nservice! Dear M. Benassis, leave me my gun. Listen! I will leave the\r\nCommune, _foi de Butifer_! I will go to the Alps; the chamois-hunters\r\nwill not say a word; on the contrary, they will receive me with open\r\narms. I shall come to grief at the bottom of some glacier; but, if I am\r\nto speak my mind, I would rather live for a couple of years among the\r\nheights, where there are no governments, nor excisemen, nor gamekeepers,\r\nnor procureurs du roi, than grovel in a marsh for a century. You are\r\nthe only one that I shall be sorry to leave behind; all the rest of them\r\nbore me! When you are in the right, at any rate you don’t worry one’s\r\nlife out----”\r\n\r\n“And how about Louise?” asked Benassis. Butifer paused and turned\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Eh! learn to read and write, my lad,” said Genestas; “come and enlist\r\nin my regiment, have a horse to ride, and turn carabineer. If they\r\nonce sound ‘to horse’ for something like a war, you will find out\r\nthat Providence made you to live in the midst of cannon, bullets, and\r\nbattalions, and they will make a general of you.”\r\n\r\n“Ye-es, if Napoleon was back again,” answered Butifer.\r\n\r\n“You know our agreement,” said the doctor. “At the second infraction of\r\nit, you undertook to go for a soldier. I give you six months in which to\r\nlearn to read and write, and then I will find some young gentleman who\r\nwants a substitute.”\r\n\r\nButifer looked at the mountains.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you shall not go to the Alps,” cried Benassis. “A man like you, a\r\nman of his word, with plenty of good stuff in him, ought to serve his\r\ncountry and command a brigade, and not come to his end trailing after\r\na chamois. The life that you are leading will take you straight to the\r\nconvict’s prison. After over-fatiguing yourself, you are obliged to take\r\na long rest; and, in the end, you will fall into idle ways that will be\r\nthe ruin of any notions of orderly existence that you have; you will get\r\ninto the habit of putting your strength to bad uses, and you will take\r\nthe law into your own hands. I want to put you, in spite of yourself,\r\ninto the right path.”\r\n\r\n“So I am to pine and fret myself to death? I feel suffocated whenever I\r\nam in a town. I cannot hold out for more than a day, in Grenoble, when I\r\ntake Louise there----”\r\n\r\n“We all have our whims, which we must manage to control, or turn them to\r\naccount for our neighbor’s benefit. But it is late, and I am in a hurry.\r\nCome to see me to-morrow, and bring your gun along with you. We will\r\ntalk this over, my boy. Good-bye. Go and sell your chamois in Grenoble.”\r\n\r\nThe two horsemen went on their way.\r\n\r\n“That is what I call a man,” said Genestas.\r\n\r\n“A man in a bad way,” answered Benassis. “But what help is there for it?\r\nYou heard what he said. Is it not lamentable to see such fine qualities\r\nrunning to waste? If France were invaded by a foreign foe, Butifer at\r\nthe head of a hundred young fellows would keep a whole division busy in\r\nMaurienne for a month; but in a time of peace the only outlets for his\r\nenergy are those which set the law at defiance. He must wrestle with\r\nsomething; whenever he is not risking his neck he is at odds with\r\nsociety, he lends a helping hand to smugglers. The rogue will cross the\r\nRhone, all by himself, in a little boat, to take shoes over into Savoy;\r\nhe makes good his retreat, heavy laden as he is, to some inaccessible\r\nplace high up among the hills, where he stays for two days at a time,\r\nliving on dry crusts. In short, danger is as welcome to him as sleep\r\nwould be to anybody else, and by dint of experience he has acquired a\r\nrelish for extreme sensations that has totally unfitted him for ordinary\r\nlife. It vexes me that a man like that should take a wrong turn and\r\ngradually go to the bad, become a bandit, and die on the gallows. But,\r\nsee, captain, how our village looks from here!”\r\n\r\nGenestas obtained a distant view of a wide circular space, planted with\r\ntrees, a fountain surrounded by poplars stood in the middle of it.\r\nRound the enclosure were high banks on which a triple line of trees of\r\ndifferent kinds were growing; the first row consisted of acacias,\r\nthe second of Japanese varnish trees, and some young elms grew on the\r\nhighest row of all.\r\n\r\n“That is where we hold our fair,” said Benassis. “That is the beginning\r\nof the High Street, by those two handsome houses that I told you about;\r\none belongs to the notary, and the other to the justice of the peace.”\r\n\r\nThey came at that moment into a broad road, fairly evenly paved with\r\nlarge cobble-stones. There were altogether about a hundred new houses on\r\neither side of it, and almost every house stood in a garden.\r\n\r\nThe view of the church with its doorway made a pretty termination to\r\nthis road. Two more roads had been recently planned out half-way down\r\nthe course of the first, and many new houses had already been built\r\nalong them. The town-hall stood opposite the parsonage, in the square by\r\nthe church. As Benassis went down the road, women and children stood in\r\ntheir doorways to wish him good-evening, the men took off their caps,\r\nand the little children danced and shouted about his horse, as if the\r\nanimal’s good-nature were as well known as the kindness of its master.\r\nThe gladness was undemonstrative; there was the instinctive delicacy of\r\nall deep feeling about it, and it had the same pervasive power. At the\r\nsight of this welcome it seemed to Genestas that the doctor had been too\r\nmodest in his description of the affection with which he was regarded by\r\nthe people of the district. His truly was a sovereignty of the sweetest\r\nkind; a right royal sovereignty moreover, for its title was engraven\r\nin the hearts of its subjects. However dazzling the rays of glory that\r\nsurround a man, however great the power that he enjoys, in his inmost\r\nsoul he soon comes to a just estimate of the sentiments that all\r\nexternal action causes for him. He very soon sees that no change has\r\nbeen wrought in him, that there is nothing new and nothing greater\r\nin the exercise of his physical faculties, and discovers his own real\r\nnothingness. Kings, even should they rule over the whole world, are\r\ncondemned to live in a narrow circle like other men. They must even\r\nsubmit to the conditions of their lot, and their happiness depends\r\nupon the personal impressions that they receive. But Benassis met with\r\nnothing but goodwill and loyalty throughout the district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE NAPOLEON OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Pray, come in, sir!” cried Jacquotte. “A pretty time the gentlemen have\r\nbeen waiting for you! It is always the way! You always manage to spoil\r\nthe dinner for me whenever it ought to be particularly good. Everything\r\nis cooked to death by this time----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! well, here we are,” answered Benassis with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe two horsemen dismounted, and went off to the salon, where the guests\r\ninvited by the doctor were assembled.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said taking Genestas by the hand, “I have the honor\r\nof introducing you to M. Bluteau, captain of a regiment of cavalry\r\nstationed at Grenoble--an old soldier, who has promised me that he will\r\nstay among us for a little while.”\r\n\r\nThen, turning to Genestas, he presented to him a tall, thin, gray-haired\r\nman, dressed in black.\r\n\r\n“This gentleman,” said Benassis, “is M. Dufau, the justice of the peace\r\nof whom I have already spoken to you, and who has so largely contributed\r\nto the prosperity of the Commune.” Then he led his guest up to a pale,\r\nslight young man of middle height, who wore spectacles, and was also\r\ndressed in black. “And this is M. Tonnelet,” he went on, “M. Gravier’s\r\nson-in-law, and the first notary who came to the village.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor next turned to a stout man, who seemed to belong half to\r\nthe peasant, half to the middle class, the owner of a rough-pimpled but\r\ngood-humored countenance.\r\n\r\n“This is my worthy colleague M. Cambon,” he went on, “the\r\ntimber-merchant, to whom I owe the confidence and good-will of the\r\npeople here. He was one of the promoters of the road which you have\r\nadmired. I have no need to tell you the profession of this gentleman,”\r\n Benassis added, turning to the curate. “Here is a man whom no one can\r\nhelp loving.”\r\n\r\nThere was an irresistible attraction in the moral beauty expressed\r\nby the cure’s countenance, which engrossed Genestas’ attention. Yet a\r\ncertain harshness and austerity of outline might make M. Janvier’s\r\nface seem unpleasing at a first glance. His attitude, and his slight,\r\nemaciated frame, showed that he was far from strong physically, but\r\nthe unchanging serenity of his face bore witness to the profound inward\r\npeace of heart. Heaven seemed to be reflected in his eyes, and the\r\ninextinguishable fervor of charity which glowed in his heart appeared\r\nto shine from them. The gestures that he made but rarely were simple and\r\nnatural, his appeared to be a quiet and retiring nature, and there was\r\na modesty and simplicity like that of a young girl about his actions. At\r\nfirst sight he inspired respect and a vague desire to be admitted to his\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n“Ah! M. le Maire,” he said, bending as though to escape from Benassis’\r\neulogium.\r\n\r\nSomething in the cure’s tones brought a thrill to Genestas’ heart, and\r\nthe two insignificant words uttered by this stranger priest plunged him\r\ninto musings that were almost devout.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Jacquotte, who came into the middle of the room, and\r\nthere took her stand, with her hands on her hips, “the soup is on the\r\ntable.”\r\n\r\nInvited by Benassis, who summoned each in turn so as to avoid questions\r\nof precedence, the doctor’s five guests went into the dining-room; and\r\nafter the cure, in low and quiet tones, had repeated a _Benedicite_,\r\nthey took their places at table. The cloth that covered the table was of\r\nthat peculiar kind of damask linen invented in the time of Henry IV. by\r\nthe brothers Graindorge, the skilful weavers, who gave their name to the\r\nheavy fabric so well known to housekeepers. The linen was of dazzling\r\nwhiteness, and fragrant with the scent of the thyme that Jacquotte\r\nalways put into her wash-tubs. The dinner service was of white\r\nporcelain, edged with blue, and was in perfect order. The decanters\r\nwere of the old-fashioned octagonal kind still in use in the provinces,\r\nthough they have disappeared elsewhere. Grotesque figures had been\r\ncarved on the horn handles of the knives. These relics of ancient\r\nsplendor, which, nevertheless, looked almost new, seemed to those who\r\nscrutinized them to be in keeping with the kindly and open-hearted\r\nnature of the master of the house.\r\n\r\nThe lid of the soup-tureen drew a momentary glance from Genestas; he\r\nnoticed that it was surmounted by a group of vegetables in high relief,\r\nskilfully colored after the manner of Bernard Palissy, the celebrated\r\nsixteenth century craftsman.\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of character about the group of men thus assembled.\r\nThe powerful heads of Genestas and Benassis contrasted admirably with\r\nM. Janvier’s apostolic countenance; and in the same fashion the elderly\r\nfaces of the justice of the peace and the deputy-mayor brought out the\r\nyouthfulness of the notary. Society seemed to be represented by these\r\nvarious types. The expression of each one indicated contentment with\r\nhimself and with the present, and a faith in the future. M. Tonnelet\r\nand M. Janvier, who were still young, loved to make forecasts of coming\r\nevents, for they felt that the future was theirs; while the other guests\r\nwere fain rather to turn their talk upon the past. All of them faced the\r\nthings of life seriously, and their opinions seemed to reflect a double\r\ntinge of soberness, on the one hand, from the twilight hues of well-nigh\r\nforgotten joys that could never more be revived for them; and, on the\r\nother, from the gray dawn which gave promise of a glorious day.\r\n\r\n“You must have had a very tiring day, sir?” said M. Cambon, addressing\r\nthe cure.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered M. Janvier, “the poor cretin and Pere Pelletier\r\nwere buried at different hours.”\r\n\r\n“Now we can pull down all the hovels of the old village,” Benassis\r\nremarked to his deputy. “When the space on which the houses stand has\r\nbeen grubbed up, it will mean at least another acre of meadow land for\r\nus; and furthermore, there will be a clear saving to the Commune of the\r\nhundred francs that it used to cost to keep Chautard the cretin.”\r\n\r\n“For the next three years we ought to lay out the hundred francs in\r\nmaking a single-span bridge to carry the lower road over the main\r\nstream,” said M. Cambon. “The townsfolk and the people down the valley\r\nhave fallen into the way of taking a short cut across that patch of land\r\nof Jean Francois Pastoureau’s; before they have done they will cut it up\r\nin a way that will do a lot of harm to that poor fellow.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure that the money could not be put to a better use,” said the\r\njustice of peace. “In my opinion the abuse of the right of way is one of\r\nthe worst nuisances in a country district. One-tenth of the cases that\r\ncome before the court are caused by unfair easement. The rights of\r\nproperty are infringed in this way almost with impunity in many and many\r\na commune. A respect for the law and a respect for property are ideas\r\ntoo often disregarded in France, and it is most important that they\r\nshould be inculcated. Many people think that there is something\r\ndishonorable in assisting the law to take its course. ‘Go and be\r\nhanged somewhere else,’ is a saying which seems to be dictated by an\r\nunpraiseworthy generosity of feeling; but at the bottom it is nothing\r\nbut a hypocritical formula--a sort of veil which we throw over our own\r\nselfishness. Let us own to it, we lack patriotism! The true patriot is\r\nthe citizen who is so deeply impressed with a sense of the importance\r\nof the laws that he will see them carried out even at his own cost and\r\ninconvenience. If you let the criminal go in peace, are you not making\r\nyourself answerable for the crimes he will commit?”\r\n\r\n“It is all of a piece,” said Benassis. “If the mayors kept their roads\r\nin better order, there would not be so many footpaths. And if the\r\nmembers of Municipal Councils knew a little better, they would uphold\r\nthe small landowner and the mayor when the two combine to oppose the\r\nestablishment of unfair easements. The fact that chateau, cottage,\r\nfield, and tree are all equally sacred would then be brought home in\r\nevery way to the ignorant; they would be made to understand that Right\r\nis just the same in all cases, whether the value of the property in\r\nquestion be large or small. But such salutary changes cannot be brought\r\nabout all at once. They depend almost entirely on the moral condition of\r\nthe population, which we can never completely reform without the potent\r\naid of the cures. This remark does not apply to you in any way, M.\r\nJanvier.”\r\n\r\n“Nor do I take it to myself,” laughed the cure. “Is not my heart set on\r\nbringing the teaching of the Catholic religion to co-operate with your\r\nplans of administration? For instance, I have often tried, in my pulpit\r\ndiscourses on theft, to imbue the folk of this parish with the very\r\nideas of Right to which you have just given utterance. For truly, God\r\ndoes not estimate theft by the value of the thing stolen, He looks at\r\nthe thief. That has been the gist of the parables which I have tried to\r\nadapt to the comprehension of my parishioners.”\r\n\r\n“You have succeeded, sir,” said Cambon. “I know the change you have\r\nbrought about in people’s ways of looking at things, for I can compare\r\nthe Commune as it is now with the Commune as it used to be. There are\r\ncertainly very few places where the laborers are as careful as ours\r\nare about keeping the time in their working hours. The cattle are well\r\nlooked after; any damage that they do is done by accident. There is no\r\npilfering in the woods, and finally you have made our peasants clearly\r\nunderstand that the leisure of the rich is the reward of a thrifty and\r\nhard-working life.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Genestas, “you ought to be pretty well pleased with\r\nyour infantry, M. le Cure.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot expect to find angels anywhere here below, captain,” answered\r\nthe priest. “Wherever there is poverty, there is suffering too; and\r\nsuffering and poverty are strong compelling forces which have their\r\nabuses, just as power has. When the peasants have a couple of leagues to\r\nwalk to their work, and have to tramp back wearily in the evening, they\r\nperhaps see sportsmen taking short cuts over ploughed land and pasture\r\nso as to be back to dinner a little sooner, and is it to be supposed\r\nthat they will hesitate to follow the example? And of those who in\r\nthis way beat out a footpath such as these gentlemen have just been\r\ncomplaining about, which are the real offenders, the workers or the\r\npeople who are simply amusing themselves? Both the rich and the poor\r\ngive us a great deal of trouble these days. Faith, like power, ought\r\nalways to descend from the heights above us, in heaven or on earth; and\r\ncertainly in our times the upper classes have less faith in them than\r\nthe mass of the people, who have God’s promise of heaven hereafter as\r\na reward for evils patiently endured. With due submission to\r\necclesiastical discipline, and deference to the views of my superiors,\r\nI think that for some time to come we should be less exacting as to\r\nquestions of doctrine, and rather endeavor to revive the sentiment of\r\nreligion in the hearts of the intermediary classes, who debate over\r\nthe maxims of Christianity instead of putting them in practice. The\r\nphilosophism of the rich has set a fatal example to the poor, and has\r\nbrought about intervals of too long duration when men have faltered\r\nin their allegiance to God. Such ascendency as we have over our flocks\r\nto-day depends entirely on our personal influence with them; is it not\r\ndeplorable that the existence of religious belief in a commune should\r\nbe dependent on the esteem in which a single man is held? When the\r\npreservative force of Christianity permeating all classes of society\r\nshall have put life into the new order of things, there will be an end\r\nof sterile disputes about doctrine. The cult of a religion is its form;\r\nsocieties only exist by forms. You have your standard, we have the\r\ncross----”\r\n\r\n“I should very much like to know, sir,” said Genestas, breaking in upon\r\nM. Janvier, “why you forbid these poor folk to dance on Sunday?”\r\n\r\n“We do not quarrel with dancing in itself, captain; it is forbidden\r\nbecause it leads to immorality, which troubles the peace of the\r\ncountryside and corrupts its manners. Does not the attempt to purify the\r\nspirit of the family and to maintain the sanctity of family ties strike\r\nat the root of the evil?”\r\n\r\n“Some irregularities are always to be found in every district, I know,”\r\n said M. Tonnelet, “but they very seldom occur among us. Perhaps there\r\nare peasants who remove their neighbor’s landmark without much scruple;\r\nor they may cut a few osiers that belong to some one else, if they\r\nhappen to want some; but these are mere peccadilloes compared with the\r\nwrongdoing that goes on among a town population. Moreover, the people in\r\nthis valley seem to me to be devoutly religious.”\r\n\r\n“Devout?” queried the cure with a smile; “there is no fear of fanaticism\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“But,” objected Cambon, “if the people all went to mass every morning,\r\nsir, and to confession every week, how would the fields be cultivated?\r\nAnd three priests would hardly be enough.”\r\n\r\n“Work is prayer,” said the cure. “Doing one’s duty brings a knowledge of\r\nthe religious principles which are a vital necessity to society.”\r\n\r\n“How about patriotism?” asked Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Patriotism can only inspire a short-lived enthusiasm,” the curate\r\nanswered gravely; “religion gives it permanence. Patriotism consists\r\nin a brief impulse of forgetfulness of self and self-interest, while\r\nChristianity is a complete system of opposition to the depraved\r\ntendencies of mankind.”\r\n\r\n“And yet, during the wars undertaken by the Revolution, patriotism----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we worked wonders at the time of the Revolution,” said Benassis,\r\ninterrupting Genestas; “but only twenty years later, in 1814, our\r\npatriotism was extinct; while, in former times, a religious impulse\r\nmoved France and Europe to fling themselves upon Asia a dozen times in\r\nthe course of a century.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe it is easier for two nations to come to terms when the strife has\r\narisen out of some question of material interests,” said the justice of\r\nthe peace; “while wars undertaken with the idea of supporting dogmas\r\nare bound to be interminable, because the object can never be clearly\r\ndefined.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, you are not helping any one to fish!” put in Jacquotte, who\r\nhad removed the soup with Nicolle’s assistance. Faithful to her custom,\r\nJacquotte herself always brought in every dish one after another, a plan\r\nwhich had its drawbacks, for it compelled gluttonous folk to over-eat\r\nthemselves, and the more abstemious, having satisfied their hunger at\r\nan early stage, were obliged to leave the best part of the dinner\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said the cure, with a glance at the justice of the peace,\r\n“how can you allege that religious wars have had no definite aim?\r\nReligion in olden times was such a powerful binding force, that material\r\ninterests and religious questions were inseparable. Every soldier,\r\ntherefore, knew quite well what he was fighting for.”\r\n\r\n“If there has been so much fighting about religion,” said Genestas, “God\r\nmust have built up the system very perfunctorily. Should not a divine\r\ninstitution impress men at once by the truth that is in it?”\r\n\r\nAll the guests looked at the cure.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said M. Janvier, “religion is something that is felt and\r\nthat cannot be defined. We cannot know the purpose of the Almighty; we\r\nare no judges of the means He employs.”\r\n\r\n“Then, according to you, we are to believe in all your rigmaroles,” said\r\nGenestas, with the easy good-humor of a soldier who has never given a\r\nthought to these things.\r\n\r\n“The Catholic religion, better than any other, resolves men’s doubts and\r\nfears; but even were it otherwise, I might ask you if you run any risks\r\nby believing in its truths.”\r\n\r\n“None worth speaking of,” answered Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Good! and what risks do you not run by not believing? But let us talk\r\nof the worldly aspect of the matter, which most appeals to you. The\r\nfinger of God is visible in human affairs; see how He directs them by\r\nthe hand of His vicar on earth. How much men have lost by leaving the\r\npath traced out for them by Christianity! So few think of reading Church\r\nhistory, that erroneous notions deliberately sown among the people lead\r\nthem to condemn the Church; yet the Church has been a pattern of perfect\r\ngovernment such as men seek to establish to-day. The principle of\r\nelection made it for a long while the great political power. Except the\r\nCatholic Church, there was no single religious institution which was\r\nfounded upon liberty and equality. Everything was ordered to this end.\r\nThe father-superior, the abbot, the bishop, the general of an order,\r\nand the pope were then chosen conscientiously for their fitness for\r\nthe requirements of the Church. They were the expression of its\r\nintelligence, of the thinking power of the Church, and blind obedience\r\nwas therefore their due. I will say nothing of the ways in which society\r\nhas benefited by that power which has created modern nations and has\r\ninspired so many poems, so much music, so many cathedrals, statues, and\r\npictures. I will simply call your attention to the fact that your modern\r\nsystems of popular election, of two chambers, and of juries all\r\nhad their origin in provincial and oecumenical councils, and in the\r\nepiscopate and college of cardinals; but there is this difference,--the\r\nviews of civilization held by our present-day philosophy seem to me\r\nto fade away before the sublime and divine conception of Catholic\r\ncommunion, the type of a universal social communion brought about by the\r\nword and the fact that are combined in religious dogma. It would be very\r\ndifficult for any modern political system, however perfect people may\r\nthink it, to work once more such miracles as were wrought in those ages\r\nwhen the Church as the stay and support of the human intellect.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Because, in the first place, if the principle of election is to be\r\nthe basis of a system, absolute equality among the electors is a first\r\nrequirement; they ought to be ‘equal quantities,’ things which modern\r\npolitics will never bring about. Then, great social changes can only be\r\neffected by means of some common sentiment so powerful that it brings\r\nmen into concerted action, while latter-day philosophism has discovered\r\nthat law is based upon personal interest, which keeps men apart. Men\r\nfull of the generous spirit that watches with tender care over the\r\ntrampled rights of the suffering poor, were more often found among the\r\nnations of past ages than in our generation. The priesthood, also,\r\nwhich sprang from the middle classes, resisted material forces and stood\r\nbetween the people and their enemies. But the territorial possessions of\r\nthe Church and her temporal power, which seemingly made her position yet\r\nstronger, ended by crippling and weakening her action. As a matter of\r\nfact, if the priest has possessions and privileges, he at once appears\r\nin the light of an oppressor. He is paid by the State, therefore he is\r\nan official: if he gives his time, his life, his whole heart, this is\r\na matter of course, and nothing more than he ought to do; the citizens\r\nexpect and demand his devotion; and the spontaneous kindliness of his\r\nnature is dried up. But, let the priest be vowed to poverty, let him\r\nturn to his calling of his own free will, let him stay himself on God\r\nalone, and have no resource on earth but the hearts of the faithful, and\r\nhe becomes once more the missionary of America, he takes the rank of an\r\napostle, he has all things under his feet. Indeed, the burden of wealth\r\ndrags him down, and it is only by renouncing everything that he gains\r\ndominion over all men’s hearts.”\r\n\r\nM. Janvier had compelled the attention of every one present. No one\r\nspoke; for all the guests were thoughtful. It was something new to hear\r\nsuch words as these in the mouth of a simple cure.\r\n\r\n“There is one serious error, M. Janvier, among the truths to which you\r\nhave given expression,” said Benassis. “As you know, I do not like to\r\nraise discussions on points of general interest which modern authorities\r\nand modern writers have called in question. In my opinion, a man who has\r\nthought out a political system, and who is conscious that he has within\r\nhim the power of applying it in practical politics, should keep his mind\r\nto himself, seize his opportunity and act; but if he dwells in peaceful\r\nobscurity as a simple citizen, is it not sheer lunacy to think to bring\r\nthe great mass over to his opinion by means of individual discussions?\r\nFor all that, I am about to argue with you, my dear pastor, for I am\r\nspeaking before sensible men, each of whom is accustomed always to bring\r\nhis individual light to a common search for the truth. My ideas may seem\r\nstrange to you, but they are the outcome of much thought caused by the\r\ncalamities of the last forty years. Universal suffrage, which finds such\r\nfavor in the sight of those persons who belong to the constitutional\r\nopposition, as it is called, was a capital institution in the Church,\r\nbecause (as you yourself have just pointed out, dear pastor) the\r\nindividuals of whom the Church was composed were all well educated,\r\ndisciplined by religious feeling, thoroughly imbued with the spirit of\r\nthe same system, well aware of what they wanted and whither they\r\nwere going. But modern Liberalism rashly made war upon the prosperous\r\ngovernment of the Bourbons, by means of ideas which, should they\r\ntriumph, would be the ruin of France and of the Liberals themselves.\r\nThis is well known to the leaders of the Left, who are merely\r\nendeavoring to get the power into their own hands. If (which Heaven\r\nforbid) the middle classes ranged under the banner of the opposition\r\nshould succeed in overthrowing those social superiorities which are so\r\nrepugnant to their vanity, another struggle would follow hard upon their\r\nvictory. It would not be very long before the middle classes in their\r\nturn would be looked upon by the people as a sort of _noblesse_; they\r\nwould be a sorry kind of _noblesse_, it is true, but their wealth and\r\nprivileges would seem so much the more hateful in the eyes of the people\r\nbecause they would have a closer vision of these things. I do not say\r\nthat the nation would come to grief in the struggle, but society would\r\nperish anew; for the day of triumph of a suffering people is always\r\nbrief, and involves disorders of the worst kind. There would be no truce\r\nin a desperate strife arising out of an inherent or acquired difference\r\nof opinion among the electors. The less enlightened and more numerous\r\nportion would sweep away social inequalities, thanks to a system in\r\nwhich votes are reckoned by count and not by weight. Hence it follows\r\nthat a government is never more strongly organized, and as a consequence\r\nis never more perfect than when it has been established for the\r\nprotection of Privilege of the most restricted kind. By Privilege I\r\ndo not at this moment mean the old abuses by which certain rights were\r\nconceded to a few, to the prejudice of the many; no, I am using it\r\nto express the social circle of the governing class. But throughout\r\ncreation Nature has confined the vital principle within a narrow space,\r\nin order to concentrate its power; and so it is with the body politic.\r\nI will illustrate this thought of mine by examples. Let us suppose that\r\nthere are a hundred peers in France, there are only one hundred causes\r\nof offence. Abolish the peerage, and all the wealthy people will\r\nconstitute the privileged class; instead of a hundred, you will have\r\nten thousand, instead of removing class distinctions, you have merely\r\nwidened the mischief. In fact, from the people’s point of view, the\r\nright to live without working is in itself a privilege. The unproductive\r\nconsumer is a robber in their eyes. The only work that they understand\r\nhas palpable results; they set no value on intellectual labor--the\r\nkind of labor which is the principal source of wealth to them. So by\r\nmultiplying causes of offence in this way, you extend the field of\r\nbattle; the social war would be waged on all points instead of being\r\nconfined within a limited circle; and when attack and resistance become\r\ngeneral, the ruin of a country is imminent. Because the rich will always\r\nbe fewer in number, the victory will be to the poor as soon as it comes\r\nto actual fighting. I will throw the burden of proof on history.\r\n\r\n“The institution of Senatorial Privilege enabled the Roman Republic to\r\nconquer the world. The Senate preserved the tradition of authority. But\r\nwhen the _equites_ and the _novi homines_ had extended the governing\r\nclasses by adding to the numbers of the Patricians, the State came to\r\nruin. In spite of Sylla, and after the time of Julius Caesar, Tiberius\r\nraised it into the Roman Empire; the system was embodied in one man,\r\nand all authority was centered in him, a measure which prolonged the\r\nmagnificent sway of the Roman for several centuries. The Emperor had\r\nceased to dwell in Rome when the Eternal City fell into the hands of\r\nbarbarians. When the conqueror invaded our country, the Franks who\r\ndivided the land among themselves invented feudal privilege as a\r\nsafeguard for property. The hundred or the thousand chiefs who owned\r\nthe country, established their institutions with a view to defending\r\nthe rights gained by conquest. The duration of the feudal system was\r\nco-existent with the restriction of Privilege. But when the _leudes_\r\n(an exact translation of the word _gentlemen_) from five hundred became\r\nfifty thousand, there came a revolution. The governing power was too\r\nwidely diffused; it lacked force and concentration; and they had not\r\nreckoned with the two powers, Money and Thought, that had set those free\r\nwho had been beneath their rule. So the victory over the monarchical\r\nsystem, obtained by the middle classes with a view to extending the\r\nnumber of the privileged class, will produce its natural effect--the\r\npeople will triumph in turn over the middle classes. If this trouble\r\ncomes to pass, the indiscriminate right of suffrage bestowed upon the\r\nmasses will be a dangerous weapon in their hands. The man who votes,\r\ncriticises. An authority that is called in question is no longer an\r\nauthority. Can you imagine a society without a governing authority?\r\nNo, you cannot. Therefore, authority means force, and a basis of just\r\njudgement should underlie force. Such are the reasons which have led me\r\nto think that the principle of popular election is a most fatal one for\r\nmodern governments. I think that my attachment to the poor and suffering\r\nclasses has been sufficiently proved, and that no one will accuse me\r\nof bearing any ill-will towards them, but though I admire the sublime\r\npatience and resignation with which they tread the path of toil, I\r\nmust pronounce them to be unfit to take part in the government. The\r\nproletariat seem to me to be the minors of a nation, and ought to remain\r\nin a condition of tutelage. Therefore, gentlemen, the word _election_,\r\nto my thinking, is in a fair way to cause as much mischief as the words\r\n_conscience_ and _liberty_, which ill-defined and ill-understood, were\r\nflung broadcast among the people, to serve as watchwords of revolt and\r\nincitements to destruction. It seems to me to be a right and necessary\r\nthing that the masses should be kept in tutelage for the good of\r\nsociety.”\r\n\r\n“This system of yours runs so clean contrary to everybody’s notions\r\nnowadays, that we have some right to ask your reasons for it,” said\r\nGenestas, interrupting the doctor.\r\n\r\n“By all means, captain.”\r\n\r\n“What is this the master is saying?” cried Jacquotte, as she went back\r\nto her kitchen. “There he is, the poor dear man, and what is he doing\r\nbut advising them to crush the people! And they are listening to\r\nhim----”\r\n\r\n“I would never have believed it of M. Benassis,” answered Nicolle.\r\n\r\n“If I require that the ignorant masses should be governed by a strong\r\nhand,” the doctor resumed, after a brief pause, “I should desire at the\r\nsame time that the framework of the social system should be sufficiently\r\nyielding and elastic to allow those who have the will and are conscious\r\nof their ability to emerge from the crowd, to rise and take their place\r\namong the privileged classes. The aim of power of every kind is its own\r\npreservation. In order to live, a government, to-day as in the past,\r\nmust press the strong men of the nation into its service, taking them\r\nfrom every quarter, so as to make them its defenders, and to remove\r\nfrom among the people the men of energy who incite the masses to\r\ninsurrection. By opening out in this way to the public ambition paths\r\nthat are at once difficult and easy, easy for strong wills, difficult\r\nfor weak or imperfect ones, a State averts the perils of the revolutions\r\ncaused by the struggles of men of superior powers to rise to their\r\nproper level. Our long agony of forty years should have made it clear to\r\nany man who has brains that social superiorities are a natural\r\noutcome of the order of things. They are of three kinds that cannot\r\nbe questioned--the superiority of the thinker, the superiority of the\r\npolitician, the superiority of wealth. Is not that as much as to say,\r\ngenius, power, and money, or, in yet other words--the cause, the means,\r\nand the effect? But suppose a kind of social _tabula rasa_, every social\r\nunit perfectly equal, an increase of population everywhere in the same\r\nratio, and give the same amount of land to each family; it would not\r\nbe long before you would again have all the existing inequalities of\r\nfortune; it is glaringly evident, therefore, that there are such things\r\nas superiority of fortune, of thinking capacity, and of power, and we\r\nmust make up our minds to this fact; but the masses will always regard\r\nrights that have been most honestly acquired as privileges, and as a\r\nwrong done to themselves.\r\n\r\n“The _social contract_ founded upon this basis will be a perpetual\r\npact between those who have and those who have not. And acting on these\r\nprinciples, those who benefit by the laws will be the lawmakers, for\r\nthey necessarily have the instinct of self-preservation, and foresee\r\ntheir dangers. It is even more to their interest than to the interest of\r\nthe masses themselves that the latter should be quiet and contented. The\r\nhappiness of the people should be ready made for the people. If you look\r\nat society as a whole from this point of view, you will soon see, as I\r\ndo, that the privilege of election ought only to be exercised by men who\r\npossess wealth, power, or intelligence, and you will likewise see that\r\nthe action of the deputies they may choose to represent them should be\r\nconsiderably restricted.\r\n\r\n“The maker of laws, gentlemen, should be in advance of his age. It is\r\nhis business to ascertain the tendency of erroneous notions popularly\r\nheld, to see the exact direction in which the ideas of a nation are\r\ntending; he labors for the future rather than for the present, and for\r\nthe rising generation rather than for the one that is passing away. But\r\nif you call in the masses to make the laws, can they rise above their\r\nown level? Nay. The more faithfully an assembly represents the opinions\r\nheld by the crowd, the less it will know about government, the less\r\nlofty its ideas will be, and the more vague and vacillating its policy,\r\nfor the crowd is and always will be simply a crowd, and this especially\r\nwith us in France. Law involves submission to regulations; man is\r\nnaturally opposed to rules and regulations of all kinds, especially if\r\nthey interfere with his interests; so is it likely that the masses will\r\nenact laws that are contrary to their own inclinations? No.\r\n\r\n“Very often legislation ought to run counter to the prevailing\r\ntendencies of the time. If the law is to be shaped by the prevailing\r\nhabits of thought and tendencies of a nation, would not that mean that\r\nin Spain a direct encouragement would be given to idleness and religious\r\nintolerance; in England, to the commercial spirit; in Italy, to the love\r\nof the arts that may be the expression of a society, but by which no\r\nsociety can entirely exist; in Germany, feudal class distinctions would\r\nbe fostered; and here, in France, popular legislation would promote the\r\nspirit of frivolity, the sudden craze for an idea, and the readiness to\r\nsplit into factions which has always been our bane.\r\n\r\n“What has happened in the forty years since the electors took it\r\nupon themselves to make laws for France? We have something like forty\r\nthousand laws! A people with forty thousand laws might as well have none\r\nat all. Is it likely that five hundred mediocrities (for there are never\r\nmore than a hundred great minds to do the work of any one century), is\r\nit likely that five hundred mediocrities will have the wit to rise to\r\nthe level of these considerations? Not they! Here is a constant stream\r\nof men poured forth from five hundred different places; they will\r\ninterpret the spirit of the law in divers manners, and there should be a\r\nunity of conception in the law.\r\n\r\n“But I will go yet further. Sooner or later an assembly of this kind\r\ncomes to be swayed by one man, and instead of a dynasty of kings, you\r\nhave a constantly changing and costly succession of prime ministers.\r\nThere comes a Mirabeau or a Danton, a Robespierre or a Napoleon, or\r\nproconsuls, or an emperor, and there is an end of deliberations and\r\ndebates. In fact, it takes a determinate amount of force to raise a\r\ngiven weight; the force may be distributed, and you may have a less or\r\ngreater number of levers, but it comes to the same thing in the end: the\r\nforce must be in proportion to the weight. The weight in this case is\r\nthe ignorant and suffering mass of people who form the lowest stratum of\r\nsociety. The attitude of authority is bound to be repressive, and great\r\nconcentration of the governing power is needed to neutralize the force\r\nof a popular movement. This is the application of the principle that I\r\nunfolded when I spoke just now of the way in which the class privileged\r\nto govern should be restricted. If this class is composed of men of\r\nability, they will obey this natural law, and compel the country to\r\nobey. If you collect a crowd of mediocrities together, sooner or later\r\nthey will fall under the dominion of a stronger head. A deputy of talent\r\nunderstands the reasons for which a government exists; the mediocre\r\ndeputy simply comes to terms with force. An assembly either obeys\r\nan idea, like the Convention in the time of the Terror; a powerful\r\npersonality, like the Corps Legislatif under the rule of Napoleon; or\r\nfalls under the domination of a system or of wealth, as it has done in\r\nour own day. The Republican Assembly, that dream of some innocent souls,\r\nis an impossibility. Those who would fain bring it to pass are either\r\ngrossly deluded dupes or would-be tyrants. Do you not think that there\r\nis something ludicrous about an Assembly which gravely sits in debate\r\nupon the perils of a nation which ought to be roused into immediate\r\naction? It is only right of course that the people should elect a\r\nbody of representatives who will decide questions of supplies and of\r\ntaxation; this institution has always existed, under the sway of the\r\nmost tyrannous ruler no less than under the sceptre of the mildest of\r\nprinces. Money is not to be taken by force; there are natural limits\r\nto taxation, and if they are overstepped, a nation either rises up\r\nin revolt, or lays itself down to die. Again, if this elective body,\r\nchanging from time to time according to the needs and ideas of those\r\nwhom it represents, should refuse obedience to a bad law in the name of\r\nthe people, well and good. But to imagine that five hundred men, drawn\r\nfrom every corner of the kingdom, will make a good law! Is it not a\r\ndreary joke, for which the people will sooner or later have to pay? They\r\nhave a change of masters, that is all.\r\n\r\n“Authority ought to be given to one man, he alone should have the\r\ntask of making the laws; and he should be a man who, by force of\r\ncircumstances, is continually obliged to submit his actions to general\r\napprobation. But the only restraints that can be brought to bear upon\r\nthe exercise of power, be it the power of the one, of the many, or\r\nof the multitude, are to be found in the religious institutions of a\r\ncountry. Religion forms the only adequate safeguard against the abuse of\r\nsupreme power. When a nation ceases to believe in religion, it becomes\r\nungovernable in consequence, and its prince perforce becomes a tyrant.\r\nThe Chambers that occupy an intermediate place between rulers and their\r\nsubjects are powerless to prevent these results, and can only mitigate\r\nthem to a very slight extent; Assemblies, as I have said before, are\r\nbound to become the accomplices of tyranny on the one hand, or of\r\ninsurrection on the other. My own leanings are towards a government by\r\none man; but though it is good, it cannot be absolutely good, for the\r\nresults of every policy will always depend upon the condition and the\r\nbelief of the nation. If a nation is in its dotage, if it has been\r\ncorrupted to the core by philosophism and the spirit of discussion, it\r\nis on the high-road to despotism, from which no form of free government\r\nwill save it. And, at the same time, a righteous people will nearly\r\nalways find liberty even under a despotic rule. All this goes to show\r\nthe necessity for restricting the right of election within very narrow\r\nlimits, the necessity for a strong government, the necessity for a\r\npowerful religion which makes the rich man the friend of the poor, and\r\nenjoins upon the poor an absolute submission to their lot. It is, in\r\nfact, really imperative that the Assemblies should be deprived of\r\nall direct legislative power, and should confine themselves to the\r\nregistration of laws and to questions of taxation.\r\n\r\n“I know that different ideas from these exist in many minds. To-day, as\r\nin past ages, there ware enthusiasts who seek for perfection, and who\r\nwould like to have society better ordered than it is at present. But\r\ninnovations which tend to bring about a kind of social topsy-turvydom,\r\nought only to be undertaken by general consent. Let the innovators\r\nhave patience. When I remember how long it has taken Christianity to\r\nestablish itself; how many centuries it has taken to bring about a\r\npurely moral revolution which surely ought to have been accomplished\r\npeacefully, the thought of the horrors of a revolution, in which\r\nmaterial interests are concerned, makes me shudder, and I am for\r\nmaintaining existing institutions. ‘Each shall have his own thought,’\r\nis the dictum of Christianity; ‘Each man shall have his own field,’ says\r\nmodern law; and in this, modern law is in harmony with Christianity.\r\nEach shall have his own thought; that is a consecration of the rights\r\nof intelligence; and each shall have his own field, is a consecration of\r\nthe right to property that has been acquired by toil. Hence our society.\r\nNature has based human life upon the instinct of self-preservation, and\r\nsocial life is founded upon personal interest. Such ideas as these are,\r\nto my thinking, the very rudiments of politics. Religion keeps these two\r\nselfish sentiments in subordination by the thought of a future life; and\r\nin this way the harshness of the conflict of interests has been somewhat\r\nsoftened. God has mitigated the sufferings that arise from social\r\nfriction by a religious sentiment which raises self-forgetfulness into\r\na virtue; just as He has moderated the friction of the mechanism of the\r\nuniverse by laws which we do not know. Christianity bids the poor bear\r\npatiently with the rich, and commands the rich to lighten the burdens of\r\nthe poor; these few words, to my mind, contain the essence of all laws,\r\nhuman and divine!”\r\n\r\n“I am no statesman,” said the notary; “I see in a ruler a liquidator of\r\nsociety which should always remain in liquidation; he should hand over\r\nto his successor the exact value of the assets which he received.”\r\n\r\n“I am no statesman either,” said Benassis, hastily interrupting the\r\nnotary. “It takes nothing but a little common sense to better the lot of\r\na commune, of a canton, or of an even wider district; a department calls\r\nfor some administrative talent, but all these four spheres of action are\r\ncomparatively limited, the outlook is not too wide for ordinary powers\r\nof vision, and there is a visible connection between their interests and\r\nthe general progress made by the State.\r\n\r\n“But in yet higher regions, everything is on a larger scale, the horizon\r\nwidens, and from the standpoint where he is placed, the statesman\r\nought to grasp the whole situation. It is only necessary to consider\r\nliabilities due ten years hence, in order to bring about a great deal\r\nof good in the case of the department, the district, the canton, or\r\nthe commune; but when it is a question of the destinies of a nation, a\r\nstatesman must foresee a more distant future and the course that events\r\nare likely to take for the next hundred years. The genius of a Colbert\r\nor of a Sully avails nothing, unless it is supported by the energetic\r\nwill that makes a Napoleon or a Cromwell. A great minister, gentlemen,\r\nis a great thought written at large over all the years of a century of\r\nprosperity and splendor for which he has prepared the way. Steadfast\r\nperseverance is the virtue of which he stands most in need; and in all\r\nhuman affairs does not steadfast perseverance indicate a power of the\r\nvery highest order? We have had for some time past too many men who\r\nthink only of the ministry instead of the nation, so that we cannot\r\nbut admire the real statesman as the vastest human Poetry. Ever to look\r\nbeyond the present moment, to foresee the ways of Destiny, to care so\r\nlittle for power that he only retains it because he is conscious of his\r\nusefulness, while he does not overestimate his strength; ever to lay\r\naside all personal feeling and low ambitions, so that he may always be\r\nmaster of his faculties, and foresee, will, and act without ceasing; to\r\ncompel himself to be just and impartial, to keep order on a large scale,\r\nto silence his heart that he may be guided by his intellect alone, to\r\nbe neither apprehensive nor sanguine, neither suspicious nor confiding,\r\nneither grateful nor ungrateful, never to be unprepared for an event,\r\nnor taken unawares by an idea; to live, in fact, with the requirements\r\nof the masses ever in his mind, to spread the protecting wings of his\r\nthought above them, to sway them by the thunder of his voice and the\r\nkeenness of his glance; seeing all the while not the details of affairs,\r\nbut the great issues at stake--is not that to be something more than a\r\nmere man? Therefore the names of the great and noble fathers of nations\r\ncannot but be household words for ever.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment, during which the guests looked at one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, you have not said a word about the army!” cried Genestas. “A\r\nmilitary organization seems to me to be the real type on which all good\r\ncivil society should be modeled; the Sword is the guardian of a nation.”\r\n\r\nThe justice of the peace laughed softly.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” he said, “an old lawyer once said that empires began with the\r\nsword and ended with the desk; we have reached the desk stage by this\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“And now that we have settled the fate of the world, gentlemen, let\r\nus change the subject. Come, captain, a glass of Hermitage,” cried the\r\ndoctor, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Two, rather than one,” said Genestas, holding out his glass. “I mean to\r\ndrink them both to your health--to a man who does honor to the species.”\r\n\r\n“And who is dear to all of us,” said the cure in gentle tones.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to force me into the sin of pride, M. Janvier?”\r\n\r\n“M. le Cure has only said in a low voice what all the canton says\r\naloud,” said Cambon.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I propose that we take a walk to the parsonage by moonlight,\r\nand see M. Janvier home.”\r\n\r\n“Let us start,” said the guests, and they prepared to accompany the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\n“Shall we go to the barn?” said the doctor, laying a hand on Genestas’\r\narm. They had taken leave of the cure and the other guests. “You\r\nwill hear them talking about Napoleon, Captain Bluteau. Goguelat, the\r\npostman, is there, and there are several of his cronies who are sure\r\nto draw him out on the subject of the idol of the people. Nicolle, my\r\nstableman, has set a ladder so that we can climb up on to the hay; there\r\nis a place from which we can look down on the whole scene. Come along,\r\nan up-sitting is something worth seeing, believe me. It will not be the\r\nfirst time that I have hidden in the hay to overhear a soldier’s tales\r\nor the stories that peasants tell among themselves. We must be careful\r\nto keep out of sight though, as these folk turn shy and put on company\r\nmanners as soon as they see a stranger.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! my dear sir,” said Genestas, “have I not often pretended to be\r\nasleep so as to hear my troopers talking out on bivouac? My word, I\r\nonce heard a droll yarn reeled off by an old quartermaster for some\r\nconscripts who were afraid of war; I never laughed so heartily in any\r\ntheatre in Paris. He was telling them about the Retreat from Moscow. He\r\ntold them that the army had nothing but the clothes they stood up in;\r\nthat their wine was iced; that the dead stood stock-still in the road\r\njust where they were; that they had seen White Russia, and that they\r\ncurrycombed the horses there with their teeth; that those who were fond\r\nof skating had fine times of it, and people who had a fancy for savory\r\nices had as much as they could put away; that the women were generally\r\npoor company; but that the only thing they could really complain of was\r\nthe want of hot water for shaving. In fact, he told them such a pack of\r\nabsurdities, that even an old quartermaster who had lost his nose with\r\na frost-bite, so that they had dubbed him _Nezrestant_, was fain to\r\nlaugh.”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Benassis, “here we are. I will go first; follow after me.”\r\n\r\nBoth of them scaled the ladder and hid themselves in the hay, in a place\r\nfrom whence they could have a good view of the party below, who had\r\nnot heard a sound overhead. Little groups of women were clustered about\r\nthree or four candles. Some of them sewed, others were spinning, a\r\ngood few of them were doing nothing, and sat with their heads strained\r\nforward, and their eyes fixed on an old peasant who was telling a story.\r\nThe men were standing about for the most part, or lying at full length\r\non the trusses of hay. Every group was absolutely silent. Their faces\r\nwere barely visible by the flickering gleams of the candles by which the\r\nwomen were working, although each candle was surrounded by a glass globe\r\nfilled with water, in order to concentrate the light. The thick darkness\r\nand shadow that filled the roof and all the upper part of the barn\r\nseemed still further to diminish the light that fell here and there upon\r\nthe workers’ heads with such picturesque effects of light and shade.\r\nHere, it shone full upon the bright wondering eyes and brown forehead of\r\na little peasant maiden; and there the straggling beams brought out the\r\noutlines of the rugged brows of some of the older men, throwing up\r\ntheir figures in sharp relief against the dark background, and giving\r\na fantastic appearance to their worn and weather-stained garb. The\r\nattentive attitude of all these people and the expression on all their\r\nfaces showed that they had given themselves up entirely to the pleasure\r\nof listening, and that the narrator’s sway was absolute. It was a\r\ncurious scene. The immense influence that poetry exerts over every mind\r\nwas plainly to be seen. For is not the peasant who demands that the tale\r\nof wonder should be simple, and that the impossible should be well-nigh\r\ncredible, a lover of poetry of the purest kind?\r\n\r\n“She did not like the look of the house at all,” the peasant was saying\r\nas the two newcomers took their places where they could overhear him;\r\n“but the poor little hunchback was so tired out with carrying her bundle\r\nof hemp to market, that she went in; besides, the night had come, and\r\nshe could go no further. She only asked to be allowed to sleep there,\r\nand ate nothing but a crust of bread that she took from her wallet. And\r\ninasmuch as the woman who kept house for the brigands knew nothing about\r\nwhat they had planned to do that night, she let the old woman into\r\nthe house, and sent her upstairs without a light. Our hunchback throws\r\nherself down on a rickety truckle bed, says her prayers, thinks about\r\nher hemp, and is dropping off to sleep. But before she is fairly asleep,\r\nshe hears a noise, and in walk two men carrying a lantern, and each man\r\nhad a knife in his hand. Then fear came upon her; for in those times,\r\nlook you, they used to make pates of human flesh for the seigneurs, who\r\nwere very fond of them. But the old woman plucked up heart again, for\r\nshe was so thoroughly shriveled and wrinkled that she thought they would\r\nthink her a poorish sort of diet. The two men went past the hunchback\r\nand walked up to a bed that there was in the great room, and in which\r\nthey had put the gentleman with the big portmanteau, the one that passed\r\nfor a _negromancer_. The taller man holds up the lantern and takes\r\nthe gentleman by the feet, and the short one, that had pretended to be\r\ndrunk, clutches hold of his head and cuts his throat, clean, with one\r\nstroke, swish! Then they leave the head and body lying in its own blood\r\nup there, steal the portmanteau, and go downstairs with it. Here is our\r\nwoman in a nice fix! First of all she thinks of slipping out, before any\r\none can suspect it, not knowing that Providence had brought her there to\r\nglorify God and to bring down punishment on the murderers. She was in a\r\ngreat fright, and when one is frightened one thinks of nothing else. But\r\nthe woman of the house had asked the two brigands about the hunchback,\r\nand that had alarmed them. So back they came, creeping softly up the\r\nwooden staircase. The poor hunchback curls up in a ball with fright, and\r\nshe hears them talking about her in whispers.\r\n\r\n“‘Kill her, I tell you.’\r\n\r\n“‘No need to kill her.’\r\n\r\n“‘Kill her!’\r\n\r\n“‘No!’\r\n\r\n“Then they came in. The woman, who was no fool, shuts her eyes and\r\npretends to be asleep. She sets to work to sleep like a child, with her\r\nhand on her heart, and takes to breathing like a cherub. The man opens\r\nthe lantern and shines the light straight into the eyes of the sleeping\r\nold woman--she does not move an eyelash, she is in such terror for her\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n“‘She is sleeping like a log; you can see that quite well,’ so says the\r\ntall one.\r\n\r\n“‘Old women are so cunning!’ answers the short man. ‘I will kill her. We\r\nshall feel easier in our minds. Besides, we will salt her down to feed\r\nthe pigs.’\r\n\r\n“The old woman hears all this talk, but she does not stir.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! it is all right, she is asleep,’ says the short ruffian, when he\r\nsaw that the hunchback had not stirred.\r\n\r\n“That is how the old woman saved her life. And she may be fairly called\r\ncourageous; for it is a fact that there are not many girls here who\r\ncould have breathed like cherubs while they heard that talk going on\r\nabout the pigs. Well, the two brigands set to work to lift up the dead\r\nman; they wrap him round in the sheets and chuck him out into the little\r\nyard; and the old woman hears the pigs scampering up to eat him, and\r\ngrunting, _hon! hon_!\r\n\r\n“So when morning comes,” the narrator resumed after a pause, “the woman\r\ngets up and goes down, paying a couple of sous for her bed. She takes up\r\nher wallet, goes on just as if nothing had happened, asks for the news\r\nof the countryside, and gets away in peace. She wants to run. Running\r\nis quite out of the question, her legs fail her for fright; and lucky it\r\nwas for her that she could not run, for this reason. She had barely gone\r\nhalf a quarter of a league before she sees one of the brigands coming\r\nafter her, just out of craftiness to make quite sure that she had seen\r\nnothing. She guesses this, and sits herself down on a boulder.\r\n\r\n“‘What is the matter, good woman?’ asks the short one, for it was the\r\nshorter one and the wickeder of the two who was dogging her.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! master,’ says she, ‘my wallet is so heavy, and I am so tired, that\r\nI badly want some good man to give me his arm’ (sly thing, only listen\r\nto her!) ‘if I am to get back to my poor home.’\r\n\r\n“Thereupon the brigand offers to go along with her, and she accepts his\r\noffer. The fellow takes hold of her arm to see if she is afraid. Not\r\nshe! She does not tremble a bit, and walks quietly along. So there they\r\nare, chatting away as nicely as possible, all about farming, and the\r\nway to grow hemp, till they come to the outskirts of the town, where the\r\nhunchback lived, and the brigand made off for fear of meeting some of\r\nthe sheriff’s people. The woman reached her house at mid-day, and waited\r\nthere till her husband came home; she thought and thought over all that\r\nhad happened on her journey and during the night. The hemp-grower came\r\nhome in the evening. He was hungry; something must be got ready for\r\nhim to eat. So while she greases her frying-pan, and gets ready to fry\r\nsomething for him, she tells him how she sold her hemp, and gabbles away\r\nas females do, but not a word does she say about the pigs, nor about\r\nthe gentleman who was murdered and robbed and eaten. She holds her\r\nfrying-pan in the flames so as to clean it, draws it out again to give\r\nit a wipe, and finds it full of blood.\r\n\r\n“‘What have you been putting into it?’ says she to her man.\r\n\r\n“‘Nothing,’ says he.\r\n\r\n“She thinks it must have been a nonsensical piece of woman’s fancy,\r\nand puts her frying-pan into the fire again.... _Pouf!_ A head comes\r\ntumbling down the chimney!\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! look! It is nothing more nor less than the dead man’s head,’ says\r\nthe old woman. ‘How he stares at me! What does he want!’\r\n\r\n“‘_You must avenge me_!’ says a voice.\r\n\r\n“‘What an idiot you are!’ said the hemp-grower. ‘Always seeing something\r\nor other that has no sort of sense about it! Just you all over.’\r\n\r\n“He takes up the head, which snaps at his finger, and pitches it out\r\ninto the yard.\r\n\r\n“‘Get on with my omelette,’ he says, ‘and do not bother yourself about\r\nthat. ‘Tis a cat.’\r\n\r\n“‘A cat! says she; ‘it was as round as a ball.’\r\n\r\n“She puts back her frying-pan on the fire.... _Pouf!_ Down comes a leg\r\nthis time, and they go through the whole story again. The man was no\r\nmore astonished at the foot than he had been at the head; he snatched\r\nup the leg and threw it out at the door. Before they had finished, the\r\nother leg, both arms, the body, the whole murdered traveler, in fact,\r\ncame down piecemeal. No omelette all this time! The old hemp-seller grew\r\nvery hungry indeed.\r\n\r\n“‘By my salvation!’ said he, ‘when once my omelette is made we will see\r\nabout satisfying that man yonder.’\r\n\r\n“‘So you admit, now, that it was a man?’ said the hunchback wife. ‘What\r\nmade you say that it was not a head a minute ago, you great worry?’\r\n\r\n“The woman breaks the eggs, fries the omelette, and dishes it up without\r\nany more grumbling; somehow this squabble began to make her feel very\r\nuncomfortable. Her husband sits down and begins to eat. The hunchback\r\nwas frightened, and said that she was not hungry.\r\n\r\n“‘Tap! tap!’ There was a stranger rapping at the door.\r\n\r\n“‘Who is there?’\r\n\r\n“‘The man that died yesterday!’\r\n\r\n“‘Come in,’ answers the hemp-grower.\r\n\r\n“So the traveler comes in, sits himself down on a three-legged stool,\r\nand says: ‘Are you mindful of God, who gives eternal peace to those who\r\nconfess His Name? Woman! You saw me done to death, and you have said\r\nnothing! I have been eaten by the pigs! The pigs do not enter Paradise,\r\nand therefore I, a Christian man, shall go down into hell, all because a\r\nwoman forsooth will not speak, a thing that has never been known before.\r\nYou must deliver me,’ and so on, and so on.\r\n\r\n“The woman, who was more and more frightened every minute, cleaned her\r\nfrying-pan, put on her Sunday clothes, went to the justice, and told him\r\nabout the crime, which was brought to light, and the robbers were\r\nbroken on the wheel in proper style on the Market Place. This good work\r\naccomplished, the woman and her husband always had the finest hemp\r\nyou ever set eyes on. Then, which pleased them still better, they had\r\nsomething that they had wished for for a long time, to-wit, a man-child,\r\nwho in course of time became a great lord of the king’s.\r\n\r\n“That is the true story of _The Courageous Hunchback Woman_.\r\n\r\n“I do not like stories of that sort; they make me dream at night,” said\r\nLa Fosseuse. “Napoleon’s adventures are much nicer, I think.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” said the keeper. “Come now, M. Goguelat, tell us about the\r\nEmperor.”\r\n\r\n“The evening is too far gone,” said the postman, “and I do not care\r\nabout cutting short the story of a victory.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind, let us hear about it all the same! We know the stories, for\r\nwe have heard you tell them many a time; but it is always a pleasure to\r\nhear them.”\r\n\r\n“Tell us about the Emperor!” cried several voices at once.\r\n\r\n“You will have it?” answered Goguelat. “Very good, but you will see that\r\nthere is no sense in the story when it is gone through at a gallop.\r\nI would rather tell you all about a single battle. Shall it be\r\nChamp-Aubert, where we ran out of cartridges, and furbished them just\r\nthe same with the bayonet?”\r\n\r\n“No, the Emperor! the Emperor!”\r\n\r\nThe old infantry man got up from his truss of hay and glanced round\r\nabout on those assembled, with the peculiar sombre expression in which\r\nmay be read all the miseries, adventures, and hardships of an old\r\nsoldier’s career. He took his coat by the two skirts in front, and\r\nraised them, as if it were a question of once more packing up the\r\nknapsack in which his kit, his shoes, and all he had in the world used\r\nto be stowed; for a moment he stood leaning all his weight on his left\r\nfoot, then he swung the right foot forward, and yielded with a good\r\ngrace to the wishes of his audience. He swept his gray hair to one side,\r\nso as to leave his forehead bare, and flung back his head and gazed\r\nupwards, as if to raise himself to the lofty height of the gigantic\r\nstory that he was about to tell.\r\n\r\n“Napoleon, you see, my friends, was born in Corsica, which is a French\r\nisland warmed by the Italian sun; it is like a furnace there, everything\r\nis scorched up, and they keep on killing each other from father to son\r\nfor generations all about nothing at all--‘tis a notion they have. To\r\nbegin at the beginning, there was something extraordinary about the\r\nthing from the first; it occurred to his mother, who was the handsomest\r\nwoman of her time, and a shrewd soul, to dedicate him to God, so that he\r\nshould escape all the dangers of infancy and of his after life; for she\r\nhad dreamed that the world was on fire on the day he was born. It was\r\na prophecy! So she asked God to protect him, on condition that Napoleon\r\nshould re-establish His holy religion, which had been thrown to the\r\nground just then. That was the agreement; we shall see what came of it.\r\n\r\n“Now, do you follow me carefully, and tell me whether what you are about\r\nto hear is natural.\r\n\r\n“It is certain sure that only a man who had had imagination enough to\r\nmake a mysterious compact would be capable of going further than anybody\r\nelse, and of passing through volleys of grape-shot and showers of\r\nbullets which carried us off like flies, but which had a respect for his\r\nhead. I myself had particular proof of that at Eylau. I see him yet;\r\nhe climbs a hillock, takes his field-glass, looks along our lines, and\r\nsays, ‘That is going on all right.’ One of the deep fellows, with a\r\nbunch of feathers in his cap, used to plague him a good deal from all\r\naccounts, following him about everywhere, even when he was getting\r\nhis meals. This fellow wants to do something clever, so as soon as the\r\nEmperor goes away he takes his place. Oh! swept away in a moment! And\r\nthis is the last of the bunch of feathers! You understand quite clearly\r\nthat Napoleon had undertaken to keep his secret to himself. That is why\r\nthose who accompanied him, and even his especial friends, used to drop\r\nlike nuts: Duroc, Bessieres, Lannes--men as strong as bars of steel,\r\nwhich he cast into shape for his own ends. And here is a final proof\r\nthat he was the child of God, created to be the soldier’s father; for\r\nno one ever saw him as a lieutenant or a captain. He is a\r\ncommandant straight off! Ah! yes, indeed! He did not look more than\r\nfour-and-twenty, but he was an old general ever since the taking of\r\nToulon, when he made a beginning by showing the rest that they knew\r\nnothing about handling cannon. Next thing he does, he tumbles upon us.\r\nA little slip of a general-in-chief of the army of Italy, which had\r\nneither bread nor ammunition nor shoes nor clothes--a wretched army as\r\nnaked as a worm.\r\n\r\n“‘Friends,’ he said, ‘here we all are together. Now, get it well into\r\nyour pates that in a fortnight’s time from now you will be the victors,\r\nand dressed in new clothes; you shall all have greatcoats, strong\r\ngaiters, and famous pairs of shoes; but, my children, you will have to\r\nmarch on Milan to take them, where all these things are.’\r\n\r\n“So they marched. The French, crushed as flat as a pancake, held up\r\ntheir heads again. There were thirty thousand of us tatterdemalions\r\nagainst eighty thousand swaggerers of Germans--fine tall men and well\r\nequipped; I can see them yet. Then Napoleon, who was only Bonaparte\r\nin those days, breathed goodness knows what into us, and on we marched\r\nnight and day. We rap their knuckles at Montenotte; we hurry on to\r\nthrash them at Rivoli, Lodi, Arcola, and Millesimo, and we never let\r\nthem go. The army came to have a liking for winning battles. Then\r\nNapoleon hems them in on all sides, these German generals did not know\r\nwhere to hide themselves so as to have a little peace and comfort;\r\nhe drubs them soundly, cribs ten thousand of their men at a time by\r\nsurrounding them with fifteen hundred Frenchmen, whom he makes to spring\r\nup after his fashion, and at last he takes their cannon, victuals,\r\nmoney, ammunition, and everything they have that is worth taking; he\r\npitches them into the water, beats them on the mountains, snaps at them\r\nin the air, gobbles them up on the earth, and thrashes them everywhere.\r\n\r\n“There are the troops in full feather again! For, look you, the Emperor\r\n(who, for that matter, was a wit) soon sent for the inhabitant, and told\r\nhim that he had come there to deliver him. Whereupon the civilian finds\r\nus free quarters and makes much of us, so do the women, who showed great\r\ndiscernment. To come to a final end; in Ventose ‘96, which was at that\r\ntime what the month of March is now, we had been driven up into a corner\r\nof the Pays des Marmottes; but after the campaign, lo and behold! we\r\nwere the masters of Italy, just as Napoleon had prophesied. And in the\r\nmonth of March following, in one year and in two campaigns, he brings\r\nus within sight of Vienna; we had made a clean sweep of them. We had\r\ngobbled down three armies one after another, and taken the conceit out\r\nof four Austrian generals; one of them, an old man who had white hair,\r\nhad been roasted like a rat in the straw before Mantua. The kings were\r\nsuing for mercy on their knees. Peace had been won. Could a mere mortal\r\nhave done that? No. God helped him, that is certain. He distributed\r\nhimself about like the five loaves in the Gospel, commanded on the\r\nbattlefield all day, and drew up his plans at night. The sentries always\r\nsaw him coming; he neither ate nor slept. Therefore, recognizing these\r\nprodigies, the soldier adopts him for his father. But, forward!\r\n\r\n“The other folk there in Paris, seeing all this, say among themselves:\r\n\r\n“‘Here is a pilgrim who appears to take his instructions from Heaven\r\nabove; he is uncommonly likely to lay a hand on France. We must let him\r\nloose on Asia or America, and that, perhaps, will keep him quiet.\r\n\r\n“The same thing was decreed for him as for Jesus Christ; for, as a\r\nmatter of fact, they give him orders to go on duty down in Egypt. See\r\nhis resemblance to the Son of God! That is not all, though. He calls all\r\nhis fire-eaters about him, all those into whom he had more particularly\r\nput the devil, and talks to them in this way:\r\n\r\n“‘My friends, for the time being they are giving us Egypt to stop our\r\nmouths. But we will swallow down Egypt in a brace of shakes, just as we\r\nswallowed Italy, and private soldiers shall be princes, and shall have\r\nbroad lands of their own. Forward!’\r\n\r\n“‘Forward, lads!’ cry the sergeants.\r\n\r\n“So we come to Toulon on the way to Egypt. Whereupon the English put to\r\nsea with all their fleet. But when we are on board, Napoleon says to us:\r\n\r\n“‘They will not see us: and it is right and proper that you should know\r\nhenceforward that your general has a star in the sky that guides us and\r\nwatches over us!’\r\n\r\n“So said, so done. As we sailed over the sea we took Malta, by way of\r\nan orange to quench his thirst for victory, for he was a man who\r\nmust always be doing something. There we are in Egypt. Well and good.\r\nDifferent orders. The Egyptians, look you, are men who, ever since the\r\nworld has been the world, have been in the habit of having giants to\r\nreign over them, and armies like swarms of ants; because it is a country\r\nfull of genii and crocodiles, where they have built up pyramids as big\r\nas our mountains, the fancy took them to stow their kings under the\r\npyramids, so as to keep them fresh, a thing which mightily pleases them\r\nall round out there. Whereupon, as we landed, the Little Corporal said\r\nto us:\r\n\r\n“‘My children, the country which you are about to conquer worships a lot\r\nof idols which you must respect, because the Frenchman ought to be\r\non good terms with all the world, and fight people without giving\r\nannoyance. Get it well into your heads to let everything alone at first;\r\nfor we shall have it all by and by! and forward!’\r\n\r\n“So far so good. But all those people had heard a prophecy of Napoleon,\r\nunder the name of _Kebir Bonaberdis_; a word which in our lingo means,\r\n‘The Sultan fires a shot,’ and they feared him like the devil. So the\r\nGrand Turk, Asia, and Africa have recourse to magic, and they send a\r\ndemon against us, named the Mahdi, who it was thought had come down from\r\nheaven on a white charger which, like its master was bullet-proof, and\r\nthe pair of them lived on the air of that part of the world. There are\r\npeople who have seen them, but for my part I cannot give you any certain\r\ninformations about them. They were the divinities of Arabia and of the\r\nMamelukes who wished their troopers to believe that the Mahdi had the\r\npower of preventing them from dying in battle. They gave out that he was\r\nan angel sent down to wage war on Napoleon, and to get back Solomon’s\r\nseal, part of their paraphernalia which they pretended our general had\r\nstolen. You will readily understand that we made them cry peccavi all\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n“Ah, just tell me now how they came to know about that compact of\r\nNapoleon’s? Was that natural?\r\n\r\n“They took it into their heads for certain that he commanded the genii,\r\nand that he went from place to place like a bird in the twinkling of an\r\neye; and it is a fact that he was everywhere. At length it came about\r\nthat he carried off a queen of theirs. She was the private property of\r\na Mameluke, who, although he had several more of them, flatly refused to\r\nstrike a bargain, though ‘the other’ offered all his treasures for her\r\nand diamonds as big as pigeon’s eggs. When things had come to that pass,\r\nthey could not well be settled without a good deal of fighting; and\r\nthere was fighting enough for everybody and no mistake about it.\r\n\r\n“Then we are drawn up before Alexandria, and again at Gizeh, and before\r\nthe Pyramids. We had to march over the sands and in the sun; people\r\nwhose eyes dazzled used to see water that they could not drink and shade\r\nthat made them fume. But we made short work of the Mamelukes as usual,\r\nand everything goes down before the voice of Napoleon, who seizes Upper\r\nand Lower Egypt and Arabia, far and wide, till we came to the capitals\r\nof kingdoms which no longer existed, where there were thousands and\r\nthousands of statues of all the devils in creation, all done to\r\nthe life, and another curious thing too, any quantity of lizards. A\r\nconfounded country where any one could have as many acres of land as he\r\nwished for as little as he pleased.\r\n\r\n“While he was busy inland, where he meant to carry out some wonderful\r\nideas of his, the English burn his fleet for him in Aboukir Bay, for\r\nthey never could do enough to annoy us. But Napoleon, who was respected\r\nEast and West, and called ‘My Son’ by the Pope, and ‘My dear Father’ by\r\nMahomet’s cousin, makes up his mind to have his revenge on England,\r\nand to take India in exchange for his fleet. He set out to lead us into\r\nAsia, by way of the Red Sea, through a country where there were palaces\r\nfor halting-places, and nothing but gold and diamonds to pay the troops\r\nwith, when the Mahdi comes to an understanding with the Plague, and\r\nsends it among us to make a break in our victories. Halt! Then every man\r\nfiles off to that parade from which no one comes back on his two feet.\r\nThe dying soldier cannot take Acre, into which he forces an entrance\r\nthree times with a warrior’s impetuous enthusiasm; the Plague was too\r\nstrong for us; there was not even time to say ‘Your servant, sir!’ to\r\nthe Plague. Every man was down with it. Napoleon alone was as fresh as a\r\nrose; the whole army saw him drinking in the Plague without it doing him\r\nany harm whatever.\r\n\r\n“There now, my friends, was that natural, do you think?\r\n\r\n“The Mamelukes, knowing that we were all on the sick-list, want to stop\r\nour road; but it was no use trying that nonsense with Napoleon. So he\r\nspoke to his familiars, who had tougher skins than the rest:\r\n\r\n“‘Go and clear the road for me.’\r\n\r\n“Junot, who was his devoted friend, and a first-class fighter, only\r\ntakes a thousand men, and makes a clean sweep of the Pasha’s army, which\r\nhad the impudence to bar our way. Thereupon back we came to Cairo, our\r\nheadquarters, and now for another story.\r\n\r\n“Napoleon being out of the country, France allowed the people in Paris\r\nto worry the life out of her. They kept back the soldiers’ pay and all\r\ntheir linen and clothing, left them to starve, and expected them to\r\nlay down law to the universe, without taking any further trouble in\r\nthe matter. They were idiots of the kind that amuse themselves with\r\nchattering instead of setting themselves to knead the dough. So our\r\narmies were defeated, France could not keep her frontiers; The Man was\r\nnot there. I say The Man, look you, because that was how they called\r\nhim; but it was stuff and nonsense, for he had a star of his own and all\r\nhis other peculiarities, it was the rest of us that were mere men. He\r\nhears this history of France after his famous battle of Aboukir,\r\nwhere with a single division he routed the grand army of the Turks,\r\ntwenty-five thousand strong, and jostled more than half of them into the\r\nsea, rrrah! without losing more than three hundred of his own men. That\r\nwas his last thunder-clap in Egypt. He said to himself, seeing that all\r\nwas lost down there, ‘I know that I am the saviour of France, and to\r\nFrance I must go.’\r\n\r\n“But you must clearly understand that the army did not know of his\r\ndeparture; for if they had, they would have kept him there by force to\r\nmake him Emperor of the East. So there we all are without him, and in\r\nlow spirits, for he was the life of us. He leaves Kleber in command,\r\na great watchdog who passed in his checks at Cairo, murdered by an\r\nEgyptian whom they put to death by spiking him with a bayonet, which\r\nis their way of guillotining people out there; but he suffered so much,\r\nthat a soldier took pity on the scoundrel and handed his flask to him;\r\nand the Egyptian turned up his eyes then and there with all the pleasure\r\nin life. But there is not much fun for us about this little affair.\r\nNapoleon steps aboard of a little cockleshell, a mere nothing of a\r\nskiff, called the _Fortune_, and in the twinkling of an eye, and in the\r\nteeth of the English, who were blockading the place with vessels of the\r\nline and cruisers and everything that carries canvas, he lands in France\r\nfor he always had the faculty of taking the sea at a stride. Was that\r\nnatural? Bah! as soon as he landed at Frejus, it is as good as saying\r\nthat he has set foot in Paris. Everybody there worships him; but he\r\ncalls the Government together.\r\n\r\n“‘What have you done to my children, the soldiers?’ he says to the\r\nlawyers. ‘You are a set of good-for-nothings who make fools of other\r\npeople, and feather your own nests at the expense of France. It will not\r\ndo. I speak in the name of every one who is discontented.’\r\n\r\n“Thereupon they want to put him off and to get rid of him; but not a bit\r\nof it! He locks them up in the barracks where they used to argufy and\r\nmakes them jump out of the windows. Then he makes them follow in his\r\ntrain, and they all become as mute as fishes and supple as tobacco\r\npouches. So he becomes Consul at a blow. He was not the man to doubt the\r\nexistence of the Supreme Being; he kept his word with Providence, who\r\nhad kept His promise in earnest; he sets up religion again, and gives\r\nback the churches, and they ring the bells for God and Napoleon. So\r\nevery one is satisfied: _primo_, the priests with whom he allows no\r\none to meddle; _segondo_, the merchant folk who carry on their trades\r\nwithout fear of the _rapiamus_ of the law that had pressed too heavily\r\non them; _tertio_, the nobles; for people had fallen into an unfortunate\r\nhabit of putting them to death, and he puts a stop to this.\r\n\r\n“But there were enemies to be cleared out of the way, and he was not the\r\none to go to sleep after mess; and his eyes, look you, traveled all over\r\nthe world as if it had been a man’s face. The next thing he did was\r\nto turn up in Italy; it was just as if he had put his head out of the\r\nwindow and the sight of him was enough; they gulp down the Austrians at\r\nMarengo like a whale swallowing gudgeons! _Haouf!_ The French Victories\r\nblew their trumpets so loud that the whole world could hear the noise,\r\nand there was an end of it.\r\n\r\n“‘We will not keep on at this game any longer!’ say the Germans.\r\n\r\n“‘That is enough of this sort of thing,’ say the others.\r\n\r\n“Here is the upshot. Europe shows the white feather, England knuckles\r\nunder, general peace all round, and kings and peoples pretending to\r\nembrace each other. While then and there the Emperor hits on the idea of\r\nthe Legion of Honor. There’s a fine thing if you like!\r\n\r\n“He spoke to the whole army at Boulogne. ‘In France,’ so he said, ‘every\r\nman is brave. So the civilian who does gloriously shall be the soldier’s\r\nsister, the soldier shall be his brother, and both shall stand together\r\nbeneath the flag of honor.’\r\n\r\n“By the time that the rest of us who were away down there in Egypt\r\nhad come back again, everything was changed. We had seen him last as a\r\ngeneral, and in no time we find that he is Emperor! And when this was\r\nsettled (and it may safely be said that every one was satisfied) there\r\nwas a holy ceremony such as was never seen under the canopy of heaven.\r\nFaith, France gave herself to him, like a handsome girl to a lancer, and\r\nthe Pope and all his cardinals in robes of red and gold come across the\r\nAlps on purpose to anoint him before the army and the people, who clap\r\ntheir hands.\r\n\r\n“There is one thing that it would be very wrong to keep back from you.\r\nWhile he was in Egypt, in the desert not far away from Syria, the Red\r\nMan had appeared to him on the mountain of Moses, in order to say,\r\n‘Everything is going on well.’ Then again, on the eve of victory at\r\nMarengo, _the Red Man_ springs to his feet in front of the Emperor for\r\nthe second time, and says to him:\r\n\r\n“‘You shall see the world at your feet; you shall be Emperor of the\r\nFrench, King of Italy, master of Holland, ruler of Spain, Portugal, and\r\nthe Illyrian Provinces, protector of Germany, saviour of Poland, first\r\neagle of the Legion of Honor and all the rest of it.’\r\n\r\n“That Red Man, look you, was a notion of his own, who ran on errands and\r\ncarried messages, so many people say, between him and his star. I myself\r\nhave never believed that; but the Red Man is, undoubtedly, a fact.\r\nNapoleon himself spoke of the Red Man who lived up in the roof of the\r\nTuileries, and who used to come to him, he said, in moments of trouble\r\nand difficulty. So on the night after his coronation Napoleon saw him\r\nfor the third time, and they talked over a lot of things together.\r\n\r\n“Then the Emperor goes straight to Milan to have himself crowned King of\r\nItaly, and then came the real triumph of the soldier. For every one\r\nwho could write became an officer forthwith, and pensions and gifts of\r\nduchies poured down in showers. There were fortunes for the staff that\r\nnever cost France a penny, and the Legion of Honor was as good as an\r\nannuity for the rank and file; I still draw my pension on the strength\r\nof it. In short, here were armies provided for in a way that had never\r\nbeen seen before! But the Emperor, who knew that he was to be Emperor\r\nover everybody, and not only over the army, bethinks himself of the\r\nbourgeois, and sets them to build fairy monuments in places that had\r\nbeen as bare as the back of my hand till then. Suppose, now, that you\r\nare coming out of Spain and on the way to Berlin; well, you would see\r\ntriumphal arches, and in the sculpture upon them the common soldiers are\r\ndone every bit as beautifully as the generals!\r\n\r\n“In two or three years Napoleon fills his cellars with gold, makes\r\nbridges, palaces, roads, scholars, festivals, laws, fleets, and harbors;\r\nhe spends millions on millions, ever so much, and ever so much more to\r\nit, so that I have heard it said that he could have paved the whole of\r\nFrance with five-franc pieces if the fancy had taken him; and all this\r\nwithout putting any taxes on you people here. So when he was comfortably\r\nseated on his throne, and so thoroughly the master of the situation,\r\nthat all Europe was waiting for leave to do anything for him that he\r\nmight happen to want; as he had four brothers and three sisters, he said\r\nto us, just as it might be by way of conversation, in the order of the\r\nday:\r\n\r\n“‘Children, is it fitting that your Emperor’s relations should beg their\r\nbread? No; I want them all to be luminaries, like me in fact! Therefore,\r\nit is urgently necessary to conquer a kingdom for each one of them, so\r\nthat the French nation may be masters everywhere, so that the Guard may\r\nmake the whole earth tremble, and France may spit wherever she likes,\r\nand every nation shall say to her, as it is written on my coins, “God\r\nprotects you.”’\r\n\r\n“‘All right!’ answers the army, ‘we will fish up kingdoms for you with\r\nthe bayonet.’\r\n\r\n“Ah! there was no backing out of it, look you! If he had taken it into\r\nhis head to conquer the moon, we should have had to put everything in\r\ntrain, pack our knapsacks, and scramble up; luckily, he had no wish for\r\nthat excursion. The kings who were used to the comforts of a throne, of\r\ncourse, objected to be lugged off, so we had marching orders. We march,\r\nwe get there, and the earth begins to shake to its centre again. What\r\ntimes they were for wearing out men and shoe-leather! And the hard\r\nknocks that they gave us! Only Frenchmen could have stood it. But you\r\nare not ignorant that a Frenchman is a born philosopher; he knows that\r\nhe must die a little sooner or a litter later. So we used to die without\r\na word, because we had the pleasure of watching the Emperor do _this_ on\r\nthe maps.”\r\n\r\nHere the soldier swung quickly round on one foot, so as to trace a\r\ncircle on the barn floor with the other.\r\n\r\n“‘There, that shall be a kingdom,’ he used to say, and it was a kingdom.\r\nWhat fine times they were! Colonels became generals whilst you were\r\nlooking at them, generals became marshals of France, and marshals became\r\nkings. There is one of them still left on his feet to keep Europe in\r\nmind of those days, Gascon though he may be, and a traitor to France\r\nthat he might keep his crown; and he did not blush for his shame, for,\r\nafter all, a crown, look you, is made of gold. The very sappers and\r\nminers who knew how to read became great nobles in the same way. And I\r\nwho am telling you all this have seen in Paris eleven kings and a crowd\r\nof princes all round about Napoleon, like rays about the sun! Keep this\r\nwell in your minds, that as every soldier stood a chance of having a\r\nthrone of his own (provided he showed himself worthy of it), a corporal\r\nof the Guard was by way of being a sight to see, and they gaped at him\r\nas he went by; for every one came by his share after a victory, it\r\nwas made perfectly clear in the bulletin. And what battles they were!\r\nAusterlitz, where the army was manoeuvred as if it had been a review;\r\nEylau, where the Russians were drowned in a lake, just as if Napoleon\r\nhad breathed on them and blown them in; Wagram, where the fighting was\r\nkept up for three whole days without flinching. In short, there were as\r\nmany battles as there are saints in the calendar.\r\n\r\n“Then it was made clear beyond a doubt that Napoleon bore the Sword\r\nof God in his scabbard. He had a regard for the soldier. He took the\r\nsoldier for his child. He was anxious that you should have shoes,\r\nshirts, greatcoats, bread, and cartridges; but he kept up his majesty,\r\ntoo, for reigning was his own particular occupation. But, all the same,\r\na sergeant, or even a common soldier, could go up to him and call him\r\n‘Emperor,’ just as you might say ‘My good friend’ to me at times. And he\r\nwould give an answer to anything you put before him. He used to sleep\r\non the snow just like the rest of us--in short, he looked almost like\r\nan ordinary man; but I who am telling you all these things have seen him\r\nmyself with the grape-shot whizzing about his ears, no more put out by\r\nit than you are at this moment; never moving a limb, watching through\r\nhis field-glass, always looking after his business; so we stood our\r\nground likewise, as cool and calm as John the Baptist. I do not know\r\nhow he did it; but whenever he spoke, a something in his words made\r\nour hearts burn within us; and just to let him see that we were his\r\nchildren, and that it was not in us to shirk or flinch, we used to walk\r\njust as usual right up to the sluts of cannon that were belching smoke\r\nand vomiting battalions of balls, and never a man would so much as say,\r\n‘Look out!’ It was a something that made dying men raise their heads to\r\nsalute him and cry, ‘Long live the Emperor!’\r\n\r\n“Was that natural? Would you have done this for a mere man?\r\n\r\n“Thereupon, having fitted up all his family, and things having so\r\nturned out that the Empress Josephine (a good woman for all that) had no\r\nchildren, he was obliged to part company with her, although he loved her\r\nnot a little. But he must have children, for reasons of State. All the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe, when they heard of his difficulty, squabbled\r\namong themselves as to who should find him a wife. He married an\r\nAustrian princess, so they say, who was the daughter of the Caesars, a\r\nman of antiquity whom everybody talks about, not only in our country,\r\nwhere it is said that most things were his doing, but also all over\r\nEurope. And so certain sure is that, that I who am talking to you have\r\nbeen myself across the Danube, where I saw the ruins of a bridge built\r\nby that man; and it appeared that he was some connection of Napoleon’s\r\nat Rome, for the Emperor claimed succession there for his son.\r\n\r\n“So, after his wedding, which was a holiday for the whole world, and\r\nwhen they let the people off their taxes for ten years to come (though\r\nthey had to pay them just the same after all, because the excisemen took\r\nno notice of the proclamation)--after his wedding, I say, his wife had a\r\nchild who was King of Rome; a child was born a King while his father was\r\nalive, a thing that had never been seen in the world before! That day a\r\nballoon set out from Paris to carry the news to Rome, and went all the\r\nway in one day. There, now! Is there one of you who will stand me out\r\nthat there was nothing supernatural in that? No, it was decreed on high.\r\nAnd the mischief take those who will not allow that it was wafted over\r\nby God Himself, so as to add to the honor and glory of France!\r\n\r\n“But there was the Emperor of Russia, a friend of our Emperor’s, who was\r\nput out because he had not married a Russian lady. So the Russian backs\r\nup our enemies the English; for there had always been something to\r\nprevent Napoleon from putting a spoke in their wheel. Clearly an end\r\nmust be made of fowl of that feather. Napoleon is vexed, and he says to\r\nus:\r\n\r\n“‘Soldiers! You have been the masters of every capital in Europe, except\r\nMoscow, which is allied to England. So, in order to conquer London and\r\nIndia, which belongs to them in London, I find it absolutely necessary\r\nthat we go to Moscow.’\r\n\r\n“Thereupon the greatest army that ever wore gaiters, and left its\r\nfootprints all over the globe, is brought together, and drawn up with\r\nsuch peculiar cleverness, that the Emperor passed a million men in\r\nreview, all in a single day.\r\n\r\n“‘Hourra!’ cry the Russians, and there is all Russia assembled, a lot\r\nof brutes of Cossacks, that you never can come up with! It was country\r\nagainst country, a general stramash; we had to look out for ourselves.\r\n‘It was all Asia against Europe,’ as the Red Man had said to Napoleon.\r\n‘All right,’ Napoleon had answered, ‘I shall be ready for them.’\r\n\r\n“And there, in fact, were all the kings who came to lick Napoleon’s\r\nhand. Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Poland, and Italy, all speaking\r\nus fair and going along with us; it was a fine thing! The Eagles had\r\nnever cooed before as they did on parade in those days, when they were\r\nreared above all the flags of all the nations of Europe. The Poles could\r\nnot contain their joy because the Emperor had a notion of setting up\r\ntheir kingdom again; and ever since Poland and France have always been\r\nlike brothers. In short, the army shouts, ‘Russia shall be ours!’\r\n\r\n“We cross the frontiers, all the lot of us. We march and better march,\r\nbut never a Russian do we see. At last all our watch-dogs are encamped\r\nat Borodino. That was where I received the Cross, and there is no\r\ndenying that it was a cursed battle. The Emperor was not easy in his\r\nmind; he had seen the Red Man, who said to him, ‘My child, you are going\r\na little too fast for your feet; you will run short of men, and your\r\nfriends will play you false.’\r\n\r\n“Thereupon the Emperor proposes a treaty. But before he signs it, he\r\nsays to us:\r\n\r\n“‘Let us give these Russians a drubbing!’\r\n\r\n“‘All right!’ cried the army.\r\n\r\n“‘Forward!’ say the sergeants.\r\n\r\n“My clothes were all falling to pieces, my shoes were worn out with\r\ntrapezing over those roads out there, which are not good going at\r\nall. But it is all one. ‘Since here is the last of the row,’ said I to\r\nmyself, ‘I mean to get all I can out of it.’\r\n\r\n“We were posted before the great ravine; we had seats in the front row.\r\nThe signal is given, and seven hundred guns begin a conversation fit to\r\nmake the blood spirt from your ears. One should give the devil his due,\r\nand the Russians let themselves be cut in pieces just like Frenchmen;\r\nthey did not give way, and we made no advance.\r\n\r\n“‘Forward!’ is the cry; ‘here is the Emperor!’\r\n\r\n“So it was. He rides past us at a gallop, and makes a sign to us that a\r\ngreat deal depends on our carrying the redoubt. He puts fresh heart into\r\nus; we rush forward, I am the first man to reach the gorge. Ah! _mon\r\nDieu_! how they fell, colonels, lieutenants, and common soldiers, all\r\nalike! There were shoes to fit up those who had none, and epaulettes for\r\nthe knowing fellows that knew how to write.... Victory is the cry all\r\nalong the line! And, upon my word, there were twenty-five thousand\r\nFrenchmen lying on the field. No more, I assure you! Such a thing was\r\nnever seen before, it was just like a field when the corn is cut, with a\r\nman lying there for every ear of corn. That sobered the rest of us. The\r\nMan comes, and we make a circle round about him, and he coaxes us round\r\n(for he could be very nice when he chose), and persuades us to dine\r\nwith Duke Humphrey, when we were hungry as hunters. Then our consoler\r\ndistributes the Crosses of the Legion of Honor himself, salutes the\r\ndead, and says to us, ‘On to Moscow!’\r\n\r\n“‘To Moscow, so be it,’ says the army.\r\n\r\n“We take Moscow. What do the Russians do but set fire to their city!\r\nThere was a blaze, two leagues of bonfire that burned for two days! The\r\nbuildings fell about our ears like slates, and molten lead and iron\r\ncame down in showers; it was really horrible; it was a light to see our\r\nsorrows by, I can tell you! The Emperor said, ‘There, that is enough of\r\nthis sort of thing; all my men shall stay here.’\r\n\r\n“We amuse ourselves for a bit by recruiting and repairing our frames,\r\nfor we really were much fatigued by the campaign. We take away with us\r\na gold cross from the top of the Kremlin, and every soldier had a little\r\nfortune. But on the way back the winter came down on us a month earlier\r\nthan usual, a matter which the learned (like a set of fools) have never\r\nsufficiently explained; and we are nipped with the cold. We were no\r\nlonger an army after that, do you understand? There was an end of\r\ngenerals and even of the sergeants; hunger and misery took the command\r\ninstead, and all of us were absolutely equal under their reign. All we\r\nthought of was how to get back to France; no one stooped to pick up\r\nhis gun or his money; every one walked straight before him, and armed\r\nhimself as he thought fit, and no one cared about glory.\r\n\r\n“The Emperor saw nothing of his star all the time, for the weather was\r\nso bad. There was some misunderstanding between him and heaven. Poor\r\nman, how bad he felt when he saw his Eagles flying with their backs\r\nturned on victory! That was really too rough! Well, the next thing is\r\nthe Beresina. And here and now, my friends, any one can assure you on\r\nhis honor, and by all that is sacred, that _never_, no, never since\r\nthere have been men on earth, never in this world has there been such\r\na fricasse of an army, caissons, transports, artillery and all, in such\r\nsnow as that and under such a pitiless sky. It was so cold that you\r\nburned your hand on the barrel of your gun if you happened to touch\r\nit. There it was that the pontooners saved the army, for the pontooners\r\nstood firm at their posts; it was there that Gondrin behaved like a\r\nhero, and he is the sole survivor of all the men who were dogged enough\r\nto stand in the river so as to build the bridges on which the army\r\ncrossed over, and so escaped the Russians, who still respected the Grand\r\nArmy on account of its past victories. And Gondrin is an accomplished\r\nsoldier,” he went on, pointing to his friend, who was gazing at him with\r\nthe rapt attention peculiar to deaf people, “a distinguished soldier who\r\ndeserves to have your very highest esteem.\r\n\r\n“I saw the Emperor standing by the bridge,” he went on, “and never\r\nfeeling the cold at all. Was that, again, a natural thing? He was\r\nlooking on at the loss of his treasures, of his friends, and those who\r\nhad fought with him in Egypt. Bah! there was an end of everything. Women\r\nand wagons and guns were all engulfed and swallowed up, everything went\r\nto wreck and ruin. A few of the bravest among us saved the Eagles, for\r\nthe Eagles, look you, meant France, and all the rest of you; it was the\r\ncivil and military honor of France that was in our keeping, there must\r\nbe no spot on the honor of France, and the cold could never make her bow\r\nher head. There was no getting warm except in the neighborhood of the\r\nEmperor; for whenever he was in danger we hurried up, all frozen as we\r\nwere--we who would not stop to hold out a hand to a fallen friend.\r\n\r\n“They say, too, that he shed tears of a night over his poor family of\r\nsoldiers. Only he and Frenchmen could have pulled themselves out of such\r\na plight; but we did pull ourselves out, though, as I am telling you,\r\nit was with loss, ay, and heavy loss. The Allies had eaten up all our\r\nprovisions; everybody began to betray him, just as the Red Man had\r\nforetold. The rattle-pates in Paris, who had kept quiet ever since the\r\nImperial Guard had been established, think that HE is dead, and hatch a\r\nconspiracy. They set to work in the Home Office to overturn the Emperor.\r\nThese things come to his knowledge and worry him; he says to us at\r\nparting, ‘Good-bye, children; keep to your posts, I will come back\r\nagain.’\r\n\r\n“Bah! Those generals of his lose their heads at once; for when he\r\nwas away, it was not like the same thing. The marshals fall out among\r\nthemselves, and make blunders, as was only natural, for Napoleon in his\r\nkindness had fed them on gold till they had grown as fat as butter,\r\nand they had no mind to march. Troubles came of this, for many of them\r\nstayed inactive in garrison towns in the rear, without attempting to\r\ntickle up the backs of the enemy behind us, and we were being driven\r\nback on France. But Napoleon comes back among us with fresh troops;\r\nconscripts they were, and famous conscripts too; he had put some\r\nthorough notions of discipline into them--the whelps were good to set\r\ntheir teeth in anybody. He had a bourgeois guard of honor too, and fine\r\ntroops they were! They melted away like butter on a gridiron. We may\r\nput a bold front on it, but everything is against us, although the army\r\nstill performs prodigies of valor. Whole nations fought against nations\r\nin tremendous battles, at Dresden, Lutzen, and Bautzen, and then it was\r\nthat France showed extraordinary heroism, for you must all of you bear\r\nin mind that in those times a stout grenadier only lasted six months.\r\n\r\n“We always won the day, but the English were always on our track,\r\nputting nonsense into other nations’ heads, and stirring them up to\r\nrevolt. In short, we cleared a way through all these mobs of nations;\r\nfor wherever the Emperor appeared, we made a passage for him; for on the\r\nland as on the sea, whenever he said, ‘I wish to go forward,’ we made\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n“There comes a final end to it at last. We are back in France; and in\r\nspite of the bitter weather, it did one’s heart good to breathe one’s\r\nnative air again, it set up many a poor fellow; and as for me, it put\r\nnew life into me, I can tell you. But it was a question all at once of\r\ndefending France, our fair land of France. All Europe was up in arms\r\nagainst us; they took it in bad part that we had tried to keep the\r\nRussians in order by driving them back within their own borders, so\r\nthat they should not gobble us up, for those Northern folk have a strong\r\nliking for eating up the men of the South, it is a habit they have; I\r\nhave heard the same thing of them from several generals.\r\n\r\n“So the Emperor finds his own father-in-law, his friends whom he had\r\nmade crowned kings, and the rabble of princes to whom he had given back\r\ntheir thrones, were all against him. Even Frenchmen and allies in\r\nour own ranks turned against us, by orders from high quarters, as at\r\nLeipsic. Common soldiers would hardly be capable of such abominations;\r\nyet these princes, as they called themselves, broke their words three\r\ntimes a day! The next thing they do is to invade France. Wherever our\r\nEmperor shows his lion’s face, the enemy beats a retreat; he worked\r\nmore miracles for the defence of France than he had ever wrought in the\r\nconquest of Italy, the East, Spain, Europe, and Russia; he has a mind to\r\nbury every foreigner in French soil, to give them a respect for France,\r\nso he lets them come close up to Paris, so as to do for them at a single\r\nblow, and to rise to the highest height of genius in the biggest battle\r\nthat ever was fought, a mother of battles! But the Parisians wanting\r\nto save their trumpery skins, and afraid for their twopenny shops, open\r\ntheir gates and there is a beginning of the _ragusades_, and an end\r\nof all joy and happiness; they make a fool of the Empress, and fly the\r\nwhite flag out at the windows. The Emperor’s closest friends among his\r\ngenerals forsake him at last and go over to the Bourbons, of whom no one\r\nhad ever heard tell. Then he bids us farewell at Fontainbleau:\r\n\r\n“‘Soldiers!’... (I can hear him yet, we were all crying just like\r\nchildren; the Eagles and the flags had been lowered as if for a funeral.\r\nAh! and it was a funeral, I can tell you; it was the funeral of the\r\nEmpire; those smart armies of his were nothing but skeletons now.) So he\r\nstood there on the flight of steps before his chateau, and he said:\r\n\r\n“‘Children, we have been overcome by treachery, but we shall meet again\r\nup above in the country of the brave. Protect my child, I leave him in\r\nyour care. _Long live Napoleon II.!_’\r\n\r\n“He had thought of killing himself, so that no one should behold\r\nNapoleon after his defeat; like Jesus Christ before the Crucifixion,\r\nhe thought himself forsaken by God and by his talisman, and so he took\r\nenough poison to kill a regiment, but it had no effect whatever upon\r\nhim. Another marvel! he discovered that he was immortal; and feeling\r\nsure of his case, and knowing that he would be Emperor for ever, he\r\nwent to an island for a little while, so as to study the dispositions of\r\nthose folk who did not fail to make blunder upon blunder. Whilst he was\r\nbiding his time, the Chinese and the brutes out in Africa, the Moors and\r\nwhat-not, awkward customers all of them, were so convinced that he was\r\nsomething more than mortal, that they respected his flag, saying that\r\nGod would be displeased if any one meddled with it. So he reigned over\r\nall the rest of the world, although the doors of his own France had been\r\nclosed upon him.\r\n\r\n“Then he goes on board the same nutshell of a skiff that he sailed in\r\nfrom Egypt, passes under the noses of the English vessels, and sets foot\r\nin France. France recognizes her Emperor, the cuckoo flits from steeple\r\nto steeple; France cries with one voice, ‘Long live the Emperor!’ The\r\nenthusiasm for that Wonder of the Ages was thoroughly genuine in these\r\nparts. Dauphine behaved handsomely; and I was uncommonly pleased to\r\nlearn that people here shed tears of joy on seeing his gray overcoat\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n“It was on March 1st that Napoleon set out with two hundred men to\r\nconquer the kingdom of France and Navarre, which by March 20th had\r\nbecome the French Empire again. On that day he found himself in Paris,\r\nand a clean sweep had been made of everything; he had won back his\r\nbeloved France, and had called all his soldiers about him again, and\r\nthree words of his had done it all--‘Here am I!’ ‘Twas the greatest\r\nmiracle God ever worked! Was it ever known in the world before that a\r\nman should do nothing but show his hat, and a whole Empire became his?\r\nThey fancied that France was crushed, did they? Never a bit of it. A\r\nNational Army springs up again at the sight of the Eagle, and we all\r\nmarch to Waterloo. There the Guard fall all as one man. Napoleon in his\r\ndespair heads the rest, and flings himself three times on the enemy’s\r\nguns without finding the death he sought; we all saw him do it, we\r\nsoldiers, and the day was lost! That night the Emperor calls all his old\r\nsoldiers about him, and there on the battlefield, which was soaked with\r\nour blood, he burns his flags and his Eagles--the poor Eagles that had\r\nnever been defeated, that had cried, ‘Forward!’ in battle after\r\nbattle, and had flown above us all over Europe. That was the end of\r\nthe Eagles--all the wealth of England could not purchase for her one\r\ntail-feather. The rest is sufficiently known.\r\n\r\n“The Red Man went over to the Bourbons like the low scoundrel he is.\r\nFrance is prostrate, the soldier counts for nothing, they rob him of\r\nhis due, send him about his business, and fill his place with nobles who\r\ncould not walk, they were so old, so that it made you sorry to see them.\r\nThey seize Napoleon by treachery, the English shut him up on a desert\r\nisland in the ocean, on a rock ten thousand feet above the rest of the\r\nworld. That is the final end of it; there he has to stop till the Red\r\nMan gives him back his power again, for the happiness of France. A lot\r\nof them say that he is dead! Dead? Oh! yes, very likely. They do not\r\nknow him, that is plain! They go on telling that fib to deceive the\r\npeople, and to keep things quiet for their tumble-down government.\r\nListen; this is the whole truth of the matter. His friends have left him\r\nalone in the desert to fulfil a prophecy that was made about him, for I\r\nforgot to tell you that his name Napoleon really means the _Lion of the\r\nDesert_. And that is gospel truth. You will hear plenty of other things\r\nsaid about the Emperor, but they are all monstrous nonsense. Because,\r\nlook you, to no man of woman born would God have given the power to\r\nwrite his name in red, as he did, across the earth, where he will be\r\nremembered for ever!... Long live ‘Napoleon, the father of the soldier,\r\nthe father of the people!’”\r\n\r\n“Long live General Eble!” cried the pontooner.\r\n\r\n“How did you manage not to die in the gorge of the redoubts at\r\nBorodino?” asked a peasant woman.\r\n\r\n“Do I know? we were a whole regiment when we went down into it, and only\r\na hundred foot were left standing; only infantry could have carried it;\r\nfor the infantry, look you, is everything in an army----”\r\n\r\n“But how about the cavalry?” cried Genestas, slipping down out of the\r\nhay in a sudden fashion that drew a startled cry from the boldest.\r\n\r\n“He, old boy! you are forgetting Poniatowski’s Red Lancers, the\r\nCuirassiers, the Dragoons, and the whole boiling. Whenever Napoleon\r\ngrew tired of seeing his battalions gain no ground towards the end of a\r\nvictory, he would say to Murat, ‘Here, you! cut them in two for me!’ and\r\nwe set out first at a trot, and then at a gallop, _one, two_! and cut a\r\nway clean through the ranks of the enemy; it was like slicing an apple\r\nin two with a knife. Why, a charge of cavalry is nothing more nor less\r\nthan a column of cannon balls.”\r\n\r\n“And how about the pontooners?” cried the deaf veteran.\r\n\r\n“There, there! my children,” Genestas went on, repenting in his\r\nconfusion of the sally he had made, when he found himself in the middle\r\nof a silent and bewildered group, “there are no agents of police spying\r\nhere! Here, drink to the Little Corporal with this!”\r\n\r\n“Long live the Emperor!” all cried with one voice.\r\n\r\n“Hush! children,” said the officer, concealing his own deep sorrow with\r\nan effort. “Hush! _He is dead_. He died saying, ‘_Glory, France,\r\nand battle_.’ So it had to be, children, he must die; but his\r\nmemory--never!”\r\n\r\nGoguelat made an incredulous gesture, then he whispered to those about\r\nhim, “The officer is still in the service, and orders have been issued\r\nthat they are to tell the people that the Emperor is dead. You must not\r\nthink any harm of him because, after all, a soldier must obey orders.”\r\n\r\nAs Genestas went out of the barn, he heard La Fosseuse say, “That\r\nofficer, you know, is M. Benassis’ friend, and a friend of the\r\nEmperor’s.”\r\n\r\nEvery soul in the barn rushed to the door to see the commandant again;\r\nthey saw him in the moonlight, as he took the doctor’s arm.\r\n\r\n“It was a stupid thing to do,” said Genestas. “Quick! let us go into\r\nthe house. Those Eagles, cannon, and campaigns!... I had quite forgotten\r\nwhere I was.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what do you think of our Goguelat?” asked Benassis.\r\n\r\n“So long as such stories are told in France, sir, she will always find\r\nthe fourteen armies of the Republic within her, at need; and her cannon\r\nwill be perfectly able to keep up a conversation with the rest of\r\nEurope. That is what I think.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later they reached Benassis’ dwelling, and soon were\r\nsitting on either side of the hearth in the salon; the dying fire in\r\nthe grate still sent up a few sparks now and then. Each was absorbed in\r\nthought. Genestas was hesitating to ask one last question. In spite of\r\nthe marks of confidence that he had received, he feared lest the doctor\r\nshould regard his inquiry as indiscreet. He looked searchingly at\r\nBenassis more than once; and an answering smile, full of a kindly\r\ncordiality, such as lights up the faces of men of real strength of\r\ncharacter, seemed to give him in advance the favorable reply for which\r\nhe sought. So he spoke:\r\n\r\n“Your life, sir, is so different from the lives of ordinary men, that\r\nyou will not be surprised to hear me ask you the reason of your retired\r\nexistence. My curiosity may seem to you to be unmannerly, but you will\r\nadmit that it is very natural. Listen a moment: I have had comrades with\r\nwhom I have never been on intimate terms, even though I have made many\r\ncampaigns with them; but there have been others to whom I would say, ‘Go\r\nto the paymaster and draw our money,’ three days after we had got drunk\r\ntogether, a thing that will happen, for the quietest folk must have a\r\nfrolic fit at times. Well, then, you are one of those people whom I\r\ntake for a friend without waiting to ask leave, nay, without so much as\r\nknowing wherefore.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Bluteau----”\r\n\r\nWhenever the doctor had called his guest by his assumed name, the\r\nlatter had been unable for some time past to suppress a slight grimace.\r\nBenassis, happening to look up just then, caught this expression of\r\nrepugnance; he sought to discover the reason of it, and looked full into\r\nthe soldier’s face, but the real enigma was well-nigh insoluble for him,\r\nso he set down these symptoms to physical suffering and went on:\r\n\r\n“Captain, I am about to speak of myself. I have had to force myself to\r\ndo so already several times since yesterday, while telling you about\r\nthe improvements that I have managed to introduce here; but it was a\r\nquestion of the interests of the people and the commune, with which mine\r\nare necessarily bound up. But, now, if I tell you my story, I should\r\nhave to speak wholly of myself, and mine has not been a very interesting\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“If it were as uneventful as La Fosseuse’s life,” answered Genestas,\r\n“I should still be glad to know about it; I should like to know the\r\nuntoward events that could bring a man of your calibre into this\r\ncanton.”\r\n\r\n“Captain, for these twelve years I have lived in silence; and now, as I\r\nwait at the brink of the grave for the stroke that will cast me into\r\nit, I will candidly own to you that this silence is beginning to weigh\r\nheavily upon me. I have borne my sorrows alone for twelve years; I have\r\nhad none of the comfort that friendship gives in such full measure to\r\na heart in pain. My poor sick folk and my peasants certainly set me\r\nan example of unmurmuring resignation; but they know that I at least\r\nunderstand them and their troubles, while there is not a soul here who\r\nknows of the tears that I have shed, no one to give me the hand-clasp of\r\na comrade, the noblest reward of all, a reward that falls to the lot of\r\nevery other; even Gondrin has not missed that.”\r\n\r\nGenestas held out his hand, a sudden impulsive movement by which\r\nBenassis was deeply touched.\r\n\r\n“There is La Fosseuse,” he went on in a different voice; “she perhaps\r\nwould have understood as the angels might; but then, too, she might\r\npossibly have loved me, and that would have been a misfortune. Listen,\r\ncaptain, my confession could only be made to an old soldier who looks as\r\nleniently as you do on the failings of others, or to some young man who\r\nhas not lost the illusions of youth; for only a man who knows life\r\nwell, or a lad to whom it is all unknown, could understand my story. The\r\ncaptains of past times who fell upon the field of battle used to make\r\ntheir last confession to the cross on the hilt of their sword; if there\r\nwas no priest at hand, it was the sword that received and kept the\r\nlast confidences between a human soul and God. And will you hear and\r\nunderstand me, for you are one of Napoleon’s finest sword-blades, as\r\nthoroughly tempered and as strong as steel? Some parts of my story can\r\nonly be understood by a delicate tenderness, and through a sympathy with\r\nthe beliefs that dwell in simple hearts; beliefs which would seem absurd\r\nto the sophisticated people who make use in their own lives of the\r\nprudential maxims of worldly wisdom that only apply to the government\r\nof states. To you I shall speak openly and without reserve, as a man who\r\ndoes not seek to apologize for his life with the good and evil done\r\nin the course of it; as one who will hide nothing from you, because he\r\nlives so far from the world of to-day, careless of the judgements of\r\nman, and full of hope in God.”\r\n\r\nBenassis stopped, rose to his feet, and said, “Before I begin my story,\r\nI will order tea. Jacquotte has never missed asking me if I will take it\r\nfor these twelve years past, and she will certainly interrupt us. Do you\r\ncare about it, captain?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you.”\r\n\r\nIn another moment Benassis returned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE COUNTRY DOCTOR’S CONFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n“I was born in a little town in Languedoc,” the doctor resumed. “My\r\nfather had been settled there for many years, and there my early\r\nchildhood was spent. When I was eight years old I was sent to the school\r\nof the Oratorians at Sorreze, and only left it to finish my studies\r\nin Paris. My father had squandered his patrimony in the course of an\r\nexceedingly wild and extravagant youth. He had retrieved his position\r\npartly by a fortunate marriage, partly by the slow persistent thrift\r\ncharacteristic of provincial life; for in the provinces people pride\r\nthemselves on accumulating rather than on spending, and all the ambition\r\nin a man’s nature is either extinguished or directed to money-getting,\r\nfor want of any nobler end. So he had grown rich at last, and thought\r\nto transmit to his only son all the cut-and-dried experience which he\r\nhimself had purchased at the price of his lost illusions; a noble last\r\nillusion of age which fondly seeks to bequeath its virtues and its\r\nwary prudence to heedless youth, intent only on the enjoyment of the\r\nenchanted life that lies before it.\r\n\r\n“This foresight on my father’s part led him to make plans for my\r\neducation for which I had to suffer. He sedulously concealed my\r\nexpectations of wealth from me, and during the fairest years of my\r\nyouth compelled me, for my own good, to endure the burden of anxiety and\r\nhardship that presses upon a young man who has his own way to make in\r\nthe world. His idea in so doing was to instill the virtues of poverty\r\ninto me--patience, a thirst for learning, and a love of work for its own\r\nsake. He hoped to teach me to set a proper value on my inheritance,\r\nby letting me learn, in this way, all that it costs to make a fortune;\r\nwherefore, as soon as I was old enough to understand his advice, he\r\nurged me to choose a profession and to work steadily at it. My tastes\r\ninclined me to the study of medicine.\r\n\r\n“So I left Sorreze, after ten years of almost monastic discipline of\r\nthe Oratorians; and, fresh from the quiet life of a remote provincial\r\nschool, I was taken straight to the capital. My father went with me in\r\norder to introduce me to the notice of a friend of his; and (all unknown\r\nto me) my two elders took the most elaborate precautions against any\r\nebullitions of youth on my part, innocent lad though I was. My allowance\r\nwas rigidly computed on a scale based upon the absolute necessaries of\r\nlife, and I was obliged to produce my certificate of attendance at the\r\nEcole de Médecine before I was allowed to draw my quarter’s income. The\r\nexcuse for this sufficiently humiliating distrust was the necessity of\r\nmy acquiring methodical and business-like habits. My father, however,\r\nwas not sparing of money for all the necessary expenses of my education\r\nand for the amusements of Parisian life.\r\n\r\n“His old friend was delighted to have a young man to guide through\r\nthe labyrinth into which I had entered. He was one of those men whose\r\nnatures lead them to docket their thoughts, feelings, and opinions\r\nevery whit as carefully as their papers. He would turn up last year’s\r\nmemorandum book, and could tell in a moment what he had been doing a\r\ntwelvemonth since in this very month, day, and hour of the present year.\r\nLife, for him, was a business enterprise, and he kept the books after\r\nthe most approved business methods. There was real worth in him though\r\nhe might be punctilious, shrewd, and suspicious, and though he never\r\nlacked specious excuses for the precautionary measures that he took with\r\nregard to me. He used to buy all my books; he paid for my lessons; and\r\nonce, when the fancy took me to learn to ride, the good soul himself\r\nfound me out a riding-school, went thither with me, and anticipated my\r\nwishes by putting a horse at my disposal whenever I had a holiday. In\r\nspite of all this cautious strategy, which I managed to defeat as soon\r\nas I had any temptation to do so, the kind old man was a second father\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n“‘My friend,’ he said, as soon as he surmised that I should break away\r\naltogether from my leading strings, unless he relaxed them, ‘young folk\r\nare apt to commit follies which draw down the wrath of their elders upon\r\ntheir heads, and you may happen to want money at some time or other;\r\nif so, come to me. Your father helped me nobly once upon a time, and\r\nI shall always have a few crowns to spare for you; but never tell any\r\nlies, and do not be ashamed to own to your faults. I myself was young\r\nonce; we shall always get on well together, like two good comrades.’\r\n\r\n“My father found lodgings for me with some quiet, middle-class people\r\nin the Latin Quarter, and my room was furnished nicely enough; but this\r\nfirst taste of independence, my father’s kindness, and the self-denial\r\nwhich he seemed to be exercising for me, brought me but little\r\nhappiness. Perhaps the value of liberty cannot be known until it has\r\nbeen experienced; and the memories of the freedom of my childhood had\r\nbeen almost effaced by the irksome and dreary life at school, from which\r\nmy spirits had scarcely recovered. In addition to this, my father had\r\nurged new tasks upon me, so that altogether Paris was an enigma. You\r\nmust acquire some knowledge of its pleasures before you can amuse\r\nyourself in Paris.\r\n\r\n“My real position, therefore, was quite unchanged, save that my\r\nnew _lycee_ was a much larger building, and was called the Ecole de\r\nMédecine. Nevertheless, I studied away bravely at first; I attended\r\nlectures diligently; I worked desperately hard and without relaxation,\r\nso strongly was my imagination affected by the abundant treasures of\r\nknowledge to be gained in the capital. But very soon I heedlessly\r\nmade acquaintances; danger lurks hidden beneath the rash confiding\r\nfriendships that have so strong a charm for youth, and gradually I was\r\ndrawn into the dissipated life of the capital. I became an enthusiastic\r\nlover of the theatre; and with my craze for actors and the play, the\r\nwork of my demoralization began. The stage, in a great metropolis,\r\nexerts a very deadly influence over the young; they never quit the\r\ntheatre save in a state of emotional excitement almost always beyond\r\ntheir power to control; society and the law seem to me to be accessories\r\nto the irregularities brought about in this way. Our legislation has\r\nshut its eyes, so to speak, to the passions that torment a young man\r\nbetween twenty and five-and-twenty years of age. In Paris he is assailed\r\nby temptations of every kind. Religion may preach and Law may demand\r\nthat he should walk uprightly, but all his surroundings and the tone of\r\nthose about him are so many incitements to evil. Do not the best of men\r\nand the most devout women there look upon continence as ridiculous? The\r\ngreat city, in fact, seems to have set herself to give encouragement to\r\nvice and to this alone; for a young man finds that the entrance to\r\nevery honorable career in which he might look for success is barred by\r\nhindrances even more numerous than the snares that are continually set\r\nfor him, so that through his weaknesses he may be robbed of his money.\r\n\r\n“For a long while I went every evening to some theatre, and little by\r\nlittle I fell into idle ways. I grew more and more slack over my work;\r\neven my most pressing tasks were apt to be put off till the morrow, and\r\nbefore very long there was an end of my search after knowledge for its\r\nown sake; I did nothing more than the work which was absolutely required\r\nto enable me to get through the examinations that must be passed before\r\nI could become a doctor. I attended the public lectures, but I no longer\r\npaid any attention to the professors, who, in my opinion, were a set of\r\ndotards. I had already broken my idols--I became a Parisian.\r\n\r\n“To be brief, I led the aimless drifting life of a young, provincial\r\nthrown into the heart of a great city; still retaining some good and\r\ntrue feeling, still clinging more or less to the observance of certain\r\nrules of conduct, still fighting in vain against the debasing\r\ninfluence of evil examples, though I offered but a feeble, half-hearted\r\nresistance, for the enemy had accomplices within me. Yes, sir, my face\r\nis not misleading; past storms have plainly left their traces there.\r\nYet, since I had drunk so deeply of the pure fountain of religion in\r\nmy early youth, I was haunted in the depths of my soul, through all my\r\nwanderings, by an ideal of moral perfection which could not fail one day\r\nto bring me back to God by the paths of weariness and remorse. Is not he\r\nwho feels the pleasures of earth most keenly, sure to be attracted, soon\r\nor late, by the fruits of heaven?\r\n\r\n“At first I went through the experience, more or less vivid, that always\r\ncomes with youth--the countless moments of exultation, the unnumbered\r\ntransports of despair. Sometimes I took my vehement energy of feeling\r\nfor a resolute will, and over-estimated my powers; sometimes, at the\r\nmere sight of some trifling obstacle with which I was about to come into\r\ncollision, I was far more cast down than I ought to have been. Then\r\nI would devise vast plans, would dream of glory, and betake myself to\r\nwork; but a pleasure party would divert me from the noble projects based\r\non so infirm a purpose. Vague recollections of these great abortive\r\nschemes of mine left a deceptive glow in my soul and fostered my belief\r\nin myself, without giving me the energy to produce. In my indolent\r\nself-sufficiency I was in a very fair way to become a fool, for what is\r\na fool but a man who fails to justify the excellent opinion which he has\r\nformed of himself? My energy was directed towards no definite aims; I\r\nwished for the flowers of life without the toil of cultivating them. I\r\nhad no idea of the obstacles, so I imagined that everything was easy;\r\nluck, I thought, accounted for success in science and in business, and\r\ngenius was charlatanism. I took it for granted that I should be a\r\ngreat man, because there was the power of becoming one within me; so I\r\ndiscounted all my future glory, without giving a thought to the patience\r\nrequired for the conception of a great work, nor of the execution, in\r\nthe course of which all the difficulties of the task appear.\r\n\r\n“The sources of my amusements were soon exhausted. The charm of the\r\ntheatre does not last for very long; and, for a poor student, Paris\r\nshortly became an empty wilderness. They were dull and uninteresting\r\npeople that I met with in the circle of the family with whom I lived;\r\nbut these, and an old man who had now lost touch with the world, were\r\nall the society that I had.\r\n\r\n“So, like every young man who takes a dislike to the career marked out\r\nfor him, I rambled about the streets for whole days together; I strolled\r\nalong the quays, through the museums and public gardens, making no\r\nattempt to arrive at a clear understanding of my position, and without\r\na single definite idea in my head. The burden of unemployed energies is\r\nmore felt at that age than at any other; there is such an abundance of\r\nvitality running to waste, so much activity without result. I had no\r\nidea of the power that a resolute will puts into the hands of a man in\r\nhis youth; for when he has ideas and puts his whole heart and soul into\r\nthe work of carrying them out, his strength is yet further increased by\r\nthe undaunted courage of youthful convictions.\r\n\r\n“Childhood in its simplicity knows nothing of the perils of life; youth\r\nsees both its vastness and its difficulties, and at the prospect\r\nthe courage of youth sometimes flags. We are still serving our\r\napprenticeship to life; we are new to the business, a kind of\r\nfaint-heartedness overpowers us, and leaves us in an almost dazed\r\ncondition of mind. We feel that we are helpless aliens in a strange\r\ncountry. At all ages we shrink back involuntarily from the unknown.\r\nAnd a young man is very much like the soldier who will walk up to the\r\ncannon’s mouth, and is put to flight by a ghost. He hesitates among the\r\nmaxims of the world. The rules of attack and of self-defence are alike\r\nunknown to him; he can neither give nor take; he is attracted by women,\r\nand stands in awe of them; his very good qualities tell against him,\r\nhe is all generosity and modesty, and completely innocent of mercenary\r\ndesigns. Pleasure and not interest is his object when he tells a lie;\r\nand among many dubious courses, the conscience, with which as yet he has\r\nnot juggled, points out to him the right way, which he is slow to take.\r\n\r\n“There are men whose lives are destined to be shaped by the impulses of\r\ntheir hearts, rather than by any reasoning process that takes place in\r\ntheir heads, and such natures as these will remain for a long while in\r\nthe position that I have described. This was my own case. I became the\r\nplaything of two contending impulses; the desires of youth were always\r\nheld in check by a faint-hearted sentimentality. Life in Paris is a\r\ncruel ordeal for impressionable natures, the great inequalities of\r\nfortune or of position inflame their souls and stir up bitter feelings.\r\nIn that world of magnificence and pettiness envy is more apt to be a\r\ndagger than a spur. You are bound either to fall a victim or to become a\r\npartisan in this incessant strife of ambitions, desires, and hatreds,\r\nin the midst of which you are placed; and by slow degrees the picture\r\nof vice triumphant and virtue made ridiculous produces its effect on\r\na young man, and he wavers; life in Paris soon rubs the bloom from\r\nconscience, the infernal work of demoralization has begun, and is\r\nsoon accomplished. The first of pleasures, that which at the outset\r\ncomprehends all the others, is set about with such perils that it is\r\nimpossible not to reflect upon the least actions which it provokes,\r\nimpossible not to calculate all its consequences. These calculations\r\nlead to selfishness. If some poor student, carried away by an\r\nimpassioned enthusiasm, is fain to rise above selfish considerations,\r\nthe suspicious attitude of those about him makes him pause and doubt;\r\nit is so hard not to share their mistrust, so difficult not to be on\r\nhis guard against his own generous thoughts. His heart is seared and\r\ncontracted by this struggle, the current of life sets toward the brain,\r\nand the callousness of the Parisian is the result--the condition of\r\nthings in which schemes for power and wealth are concealed by the most\r\ncharming frivolity, and lurk beneath the sentimental transports that\r\ntake the place of enthusiasm. The simplest-natured woman in Paris always\r\nkeeps a clear head even in the intoxication of happiness.\r\n\r\n“This atmosphere was bound to affect my opinions and my conduct. The\r\nerrors that have poisoned my life would have lain lightly on many a\r\nconscience, but we in the South have a religious faith that leads us to\r\nbelieve in a future life, and in the truths set forth by the Catholic\r\nChurch. These beliefs give depth and gravity to every feeling, and to\r\nremorse a terrible and lasting power.\r\n\r\n“The army were masters of society at the time when I was studying\r\nmedicine. In order to shine in women’s eyes, one had to be a colonel at\r\nthe very least. A poor student counted for absolutely nothing. Goaded by\r\nthe strength of my desires, and finding no outlet for them; hampered at\r\nevery step and in every wish by the want of money; looking on study and\r\nfame as too slow a means of arriving at the pleasures that tempted\r\nme; drawn one way by my inward scruples, and another by evil examples;\r\nmeeting with every facility for low dissipation, and finding nothing\r\nbut hindrances barring the way to good society, I passed my days\r\nin wretchedness, overwhelmed by a surging tumult of desires, and by\r\nindolence of the most deadly kind, utterly cast down at times, only to\r\nbe as suddenly elated.\r\n\r\n“The catastrophe which at length put an end to this crisis was\r\ncommonplace enough. The thought of troubling the peace of a household\r\nhas always been repugnant to me; and not only so, I could not dissemble\r\nmy feelings, the instinct of sincerity was too strong in me; I should\r\nhave found it a physical impossibility to lead a life of glaring\r\nfalsity. There is for me but little attraction in pleasures that must be\r\nsnatched. I wish for full consciousness of my happiness. I led a life\r\nof solitude, for which there seemed to be no remedy; for I shrank\r\nfrom openly vicious courses, and the many efforts that I made to enter\r\nsociety were all in vain. There I might have met with some woman who\r\nwould have undertaken the task of teaching me the perils of every path,\r\nwho would have formed my manners, counseled me without wounding my\r\nvanity, and introduced me everywhere where I was likely to make friends\r\nwho would be useful to me in my future career. In my despair, an\r\nintrigue of the most dangerous kind would perhaps have had its\r\nattractions for me; but even peril was out of my reach. My inexperience\r\nsent me back again to my solitude, where I dwelt face to face with my\r\nthwarted desires.\r\n\r\n“At last I formed a connection, at first a secret one, with a girl, whom\r\nI persuaded, half against her will, to share my life. Her people were\r\nworthy folk, who had but small means. It was not very long before she\r\nleft her simple sheltered life, and fearlessly intrusted me with a\r\nfuture that virtue would have made happy and fair; thinking, no doubt,\r\nthat my narrow income was the surest guarantee of my faithfulness to\r\nher. From that moment the tempest that had raged within me ceased, and\r\nhappiness lulled my wild desires and ambitions to sleep. Such happiness\r\nis only possible for a young man who is ignorant of the world, who knows\r\nnothing as yet of its accepted codes nor of the strength of prejudice;\r\nbut while it lasts, his happiness is as all-absorbing as a child’s. Is\r\nnot first love like a return of childhood across the intervening years\r\nof anxiety and toil?\r\n\r\n“There are men who learn life at a glance, who see it for what it is at\r\nonce, who learn experience from the mistakes of others, who apply the\r\ncurrent maxims of worldly wisdom to their own case with signal success,\r\nand make unerring forecasts at all times. Wise in their generation are\r\nsuch cool heads as these! But there is also a luckless race endowed with\r\nthe impressionable, keenly-sensitive temperament of the poet; these are\r\nthe natures that fall into error, and to this latter class I belonged.\r\nThere was no great depth in the feeling that first drew me towards this\r\npoor girl; I followed my instinct rather than my heart when I sacrificed\r\nher to myself, and I found no lack of excellent reasons wherewith to\r\npersuade myself that there was no harm whatever in what I had done. And\r\nas for her--she was devotion itself, a noble soul with a clear, keen\r\nintelligence and a heart of gold. She never counseled me other than\r\nwisely. Her love put fresh heart into me from the first; she foretold a\r\nsplendid future of success and fortune for me, and gently constrained me\r\nto take up my studies again by her belief in me. In these days there is\r\nscarcely a branch of science that has no bearing upon medicine; it is a\r\ndifficult task to achieve distinction, but the reward is great, for in\r\nParis fame always means fortune. The unselfish girl devoted herself\r\nto me, shared in every interest, even the slightest, of my life, and\r\nmanaged so carefully and wisely that we lived in comfort on my narrow\r\nincome. I had more money to spare, now that there were two of us, than\r\nI had ever had while I lived by myself. Those were my happiest days. I\r\nworked with enthusiasm, I had a definite aim before me, I had found the\r\nencouragement I needed. Everything I did or thought I carried to her,\r\nwho had not only found the way to gain my love, but above and beyond\r\nthis had filled me with sincere respect for her by the modest discretion\r\nwhich she displayed in a position where discretion and modesty seemed\r\nwell-nigh impossible. But one day was like another, sir; and it is only\r\nafter our hears have passed through all the storms appointed for us that\r\nwe know the value of a monotonous happiness, and learn that life holds\r\nnothing more sweet for us than this; a calm happiness in which the\r\nfatigue of existence is felt no longer, and the inmost thoughts of\r\neither find response in the other’s soul.\r\n\r\n“My former dreams assailed me again. They were my own vehement longings\r\nfor the pleasures of wealth that awoke, though it was in love’s name\r\nthat I now asked for them. In the evenings I grew abstracted and moody,\r\nrapt in imaginings of the pleasures I could enjoy if I were rich,\r\nand thoughtlessly gave expression to my desires in answer to a tender\r\nquestioning voice. I must have drawn a painful sigh from her who had\r\ndevoted herself to my happiness; for she, sweet soul, felt nothing more\r\ncruelly than the thought that I wished for something that she could not\r\ngive me immediately. Oh! sir, a woman’s devotion is sublime!”\r\n\r\nThere was a sharp distress in the doctor’s exclamation which seemed\r\nprompted by some recollection of his own; he paused for a brief while,\r\nand Genestas respected his musings.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” Benassis resumed, “something happened which should have\r\nconcluded the marriage thus begun; but instead of that it put an end to\r\nit, and was the cause of all my misfortunes. My father died and left\r\nme a large fortune. The necessary business arrangements demanded my\r\npresence in Languedoc for several months, and I went thither alone.\r\nAt last I had regained my freedom! Even the mildest yoke is galling\r\nto youth; we do not see its necessity any more than we see the need to\r\nwork, until we have had some experience of life. I came and went without\r\ngiving an account of my actions to any one; there was no need to do so\r\nnow unless I wished, and I relished liberty with all the keen capacity\r\nfor enjoyment that we have in Languedoc. I did not absolutely forget the\r\nties that bound me; but I was so absorbed in other matters of interest,\r\nthat my mind was distracted from them, and little by little the\r\nrecollection of them faded away. Letters full of heartfelt tenderness\r\nreached me; but at two-and-twenty a young man imagines that all women\r\nare alike tender; he does not know love from a passing infatuation; all\r\nthings are confused in the sensations of pleasure which seem at first\r\nto comprise everything. It was only later, when I came to a clearer\r\nknowledge of men and of things as they are, that I could estimate those\r\nnoble letters at their just worth. No trace of selfishness was mingled\r\nwith the feeling expressed in them; there was nothing but gladness on\r\nmy account for my change of fortune, and regret on her own; it never\r\noccurred to her that I could change towards her, for she felt that she\r\nherself was incapable of change. But even then I had given myself up to\r\nambitious dreams; I thought of drinking deeply of all the delights that\r\nwealth could give, of becoming a person of consequence, of making a\r\nbrilliant marriage. So I read the letters, and contented myself with\r\nsaying, ‘She is very fond of me,’ with the indifference of a coxcomb.\r\nEven then I was perplexed as to how to extricate myself from this\r\nentanglement; I was ashamed of it, and this fact as well as my\r\nperplexity led me to be cruel. We begin by wounding the victim, and then\r\nwe kill it, that the sight of our cruelty may no longer put us to the\r\nblush. Late reflections upon those days of error have unveiled for me\r\nmany a dark depth in the human heart. Yes, believe me, those who best\r\nhave fathomed the good and evil in human nature have honestly examined\r\nthemselves in the first instance. Conscience is the starting-point of\r\nour investigations; we proceed from ourselves to others, never from\r\nothers to ourselves.\r\n\r\n“When I returned to Paris I took up my abode in a large house which,\r\nin pursuance with my orders, had been taken for me, and the one person\r\ninterested in my return and change of address was not informed of it. I\r\nwished to cut a figure among young men of fashion. I waited a few\r\ndays to taste the first delights of wealth; and when, flushed with the\r\nexcitement of my new position, I felt that I could trust myself to do\r\nso, I went to see the poor girl whom I meant to cast off. With a woman’s\r\nquickness she saw what was passing in my mind, and hid her tears from\r\nme. She could not but have despised me; but it was her nature to be\r\ngentle and kindly, and she never showed her scorn. Her forbearance was a\r\ncruel punishment. An unresisting victim is not a pleasant thing; whether\r\nthe murder is done decorously in the drawing-room, or brutally on the\r\nhighway, there should be a struggle to give some plausible excuse for\r\ntaking a life. I renewed my visits very affectionately at first, making\r\nefforts to be gracious, if not tender; by slow degrees I became politely\r\ncivil; and one day, by a sort of tacit agreement between us, she allowed\r\nme to treat her as a stranger, and I thought that I had done all that\r\ncould be expected of me. Nevertheless I abandoned myself to my new life\r\nwith almost frenzied eagerness, and sought to drown in gaiety any vague\r\nlingering remorse that I felt. A man who has lost his self-respect\r\ncannot endure his own society, so I led the dissipated life that wealthy\r\nyoung men lead in Paris. Owing to a good education and an excellent\r\nmemory, I seemed cleverer than I really was, forthwith I looked down\r\nupon other people; and those who, for their own purposes, wished to\r\nprove to me that I was possessed of extraordinary abilities, found\r\nme quite convinced on that head. Praise is the most insidious of all\r\nmethods of treachery known to the world; and this is nowhere better\r\nunderstood than in Paris, where intriguing schemers know how to stifle\r\nevery kind of talent at its birth by heaping laurels on its cradle. So\r\nI did nothing worthy of my reputation; I reaped no advantages from the\r\ngolden opinions entertained of me, and made no acquaintances likely\r\nto be useful in my future career. I wasted my energies in numberless\r\nfrivolous pursuits, and in the short-lived love intrigues that are the\r\ndisgrace of salons in Paris, where every one seeks for love, grows blase\r\nin the pursuit, falls into the libertinism sanctioned by polite society,\r\nand ends by feeling as much astonished at real passion as the world is\r\nover a heroic action. I did as others did. Often I dealt to generous and\r\ncandid souls the deadly wound from which I myself was slowly perishing.\r\nYet though deceptive appearances might lead others to misjudge me, I\r\ncould never overcome my scrupulous delicacy. Many times I have been\r\nduped, and should have blushed for myself had it been otherwise; I\r\nsecretly prided myself on acting in good faith, although this lowered me\r\nin the eyes of others. As a matter of fact the world has a considerable\r\nrespect for cleverness, whatever form it takes, and success justifies\r\neverything. So the world was pleased to attribute to me all the good\r\nqualities and evil propensities, all the victories and defeats which had\r\nnever been mine; credited me with conquests of which I knew nothing, and\r\nsat in judgment upon actions of which I had never been guilty. I scorned\r\nto contradict the slanders, and self-love led me to regard the more\r\nflattering rumors with a certain complacence. Outwardly my existence was\r\npleasant enough, but in reality I was miserable. If it had not been for\r\nthe tempest of misfortunes that very soon burst over my head, all\r\ngood impulses must have perished, and evil would have triumphed in the\r\nstruggle that went on within me; enervating self-indulgence would have\r\ndestroyed the body, as the detestable habits of egotism exhausted the\r\nsprings of the soul. But I was ruined financially. This was how it came\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n“No matter how large his fortune may be, a man is sure to find some one\r\nelse in Paris possessed of yet greater wealth, whom he must needs aim at\r\nsurpassing. In this unequal conquest I was vanquished at the end of four\r\nyears; and, like many another harebrained youngster, I was obliged to\r\nsell part of my property and to mortgage the remainder to satisfy my\r\ncreditors. Then a terrible blow suddenly struck me down.\r\n\r\n“Two years had passed since I had last seen the woman whom I had\r\ndeserted. The turn that my affairs were taking would no doubt have\r\nbrought me back to her once more; but one evening, in the midst of a gay\r\ncircle of acquaintances, I received a note written in a trembling hand.\r\nIt only contained these few words:\r\n\r\n“‘I have only a very little while to live, and I should like to see\r\nyou, my friend, so that I may know what will become of my child--whether\r\nhenceforward he will be yours; and also to soften the regret that some\r\nday you might perhaps feel for my death.’\r\n\r\n“The letter made me shudder. It was a revelation of secret anguish in\r\nthe past, while it contained a whole unknown future. I set out on\r\nfoot, I would not wait for my carriage, I went across Paris, goaded by\r\nremorse, and gnawed by a dreadful fear that was confirmed by the first\r\nsight of my victim. In the extreme neatness and cleanliness beneath\r\nwhich she had striven to hid her poverty I read all the terrible\r\nsufferings of her life; she was nobly reticent about them in her effort\r\nto spare my feelings, and only alluded to them after I had solemnly\r\npromised to adopt our child. She died, sir, in spite of all the care\r\nlavished upon her, and all that science could suggest was done for her\r\nin vain. The care and devotion that had come too late only served to\r\nrender her last moments less bitter.\r\n\r\n“To support her little one she had worked incessantly with her needle.\r\nLove for her child had given her strength to endure her life of\r\nhardship; but it had not enabled her to bear my desertion, the keenest\r\nof all her griefs. Many times she had thought of trying to see me, but\r\nher woman’s pride had always prevented this. While I squandered floods\r\nof gold upon my caprices, no memory of the past had ever bidden a single\r\ndrop to fall in her home to help mother and child to live; but she had\r\nbeen content to weep, and had not cursed me; she had looked upon her\r\nevil fortune as the natural punishment of her error. With the aid of a\r\ngood priest of Saint Sulpice, whose kindly voice had restored peace to\r\nher soul, she had sought for hope in the shadow of the altar, whither\r\nshe had gone to dry her tears. The bitter flood that I had poured into\r\nher heart gradually abated; and one day, when she heard her child say\r\n‘Father,’ a word that she had not taught him, she forgave my crime. But\r\nsorrow and weeping and days and nights of ceaseless toil injured her\r\nhealth. Religion had brought its consolations and the courage to bear\r\nthe ills of life, but all too late. She fell ill of a heart complaint\r\nbrought on by grief and by the strain of expectation, for she always\r\nthought that I should return, and her hopes always sprang up afresh\r\nafter every disappointment. Her health grew worse; and at last, as she\r\nwas lying on her deathbed, she wrote those few lines, containing no word\r\nof reproach, prompted by religion, and by a belief in the goodness in my\r\nnature. She knew, she said, that I was blinded rather than bent on doing\r\nwrong. She even accused herself of carrying her womanly pride too far.\r\n‘If I had only written sooner,’ she said, ‘perhaps there might have been\r\ntime for a marriage which would have legitimated our child.’\r\n\r\n“It was only on her child’s account that she wished for the\r\nsolemnization of the ties that bound us, nor would she have sought for\r\nthis if she had not felt that death was at hand to unloose them. But\r\nit was too late; even then she had only a few hours to live. By her\r\nbedside, where I learned to know the worth of a devoted heart, my nature\r\nunderwent a final change. I was still at an age when tears are shed.\r\nDuring those last days, while the precious life yet lingered, my\r\ntears, my words, and everything I did bore witness to my heartstricken\r\nrepentance. The meanness and pettiness of the society in which I had\r\nmoved, the emptiness and selfishness of women of fashion, had taught me\r\nto wish for and to seek an elect soul, and now I had found it--too late.\r\nI was weary of lying words and of masked faces; counterfeit passion\r\nhad set me dreaming; I had called on love; and now I beheld love lying\r\nbefore me, slain by my own hands, and had no power to keep it beside me,\r\nno power to keep what was so wholly mine.\r\n\r\n“The experience of four years had taught me to know my own real\r\ncharacter. My temperament, the nature of my imagination, my religious\r\nprinciples, which had not been eradicated, but had rather lain\r\ndormant; my turn of mind, my heart that only now began to make itself\r\nfelt--everything within me led me to resolve to fill my life with\r\nthe pleasures of affection, to replace a lawless love by family\r\nhappiness--the truest happiness on earth. Visions of close and dear\r\ncompanionship appealed to me but the more strongly for my wanderings\r\nin the wilderness, my grasping at pleasures unennobled by thought or\r\nfeeling. So though the revolution within me was rapidly effected, it\r\nwas permanent. With my southern temperament, warped by the life I led in\r\nParis, I should certainly have come to look without pity on an unhappy\r\ngirl betrayed by her lover; I should have laughed at the story if it\r\nhad been told me by some wag in merry company (for with us in France\r\na clever bon mot dispels all feelings of horror at a crime), but all\r\nsophistries were silenced in the presence of this angelic creature,\r\nagainst whom I could bring no least word of reproach. There stood her\r\ncoffin, and my child, who did not know that I had murdered his mother,\r\nand smiled at me.\r\n\r\n“She died. She died happy when she saw that I loved her, and that this\r\nnew love was due neither to pity nor to the ties that bound us together.\r\nNever shall I forget her last hours. Love had been won back, her mind\r\nwas at rest about her child, and happiness triumphed over suffering.\r\nThe comfort and luxury about her, the merriment of her child, who looked\r\nprettier still in the dainty garb that had replaced his baby-clothes,\r\nwere pledges of a happy future for the little one, in whom she saw her\r\nown life renewed.\r\n\r\n“The curate of Saint Sulpice witnessed my terrible distress. His words\r\nwell-nigh made me despair. He did not attempt to offer conventional\r\nconsolation, and put the gravity of my responsibilities unsparingly\r\nbefore me, but I had no need of a spur. The conscience within me spoke\r\nloudly enough already. A woman had placed a generous confidence in me.\r\nI had lied to her from the first; I had told her that I loved her, and\r\nthen I had cast her off; I had brought all this sorrow upon an unhappy\r\ngirl who had braved the opinion of the world for me, and who therefore\r\nshould have been sacred in my eyes. She had died forgiving me. Her\r\nimplicit trust in the word of a man who had once before broken his\r\npromise to her effaced the memory of all her pain and grief, and she\r\nslept in peace. Agatha, who had given me her girlish faith, had found in\r\nher heart another faith to give me--the faith of a mother. Oh! sir, the\r\nchild, _her_ child! God alone can know all that he was to me! The dear\r\nlittle one was like his mother; he had her winning grace in his little\r\nways, his talk and ideas; but for me, my child was not only a child, but\r\nsomething more; was he not the token of my forgiveness, my honor?\r\n\r\n“He should have more than a father’s affection. He should be loved as\r\nhis mother would have loved him. My remorse might change to happiness if\r\nI could only make him feel that his mother’s arms were still about him.\r\nI clung to him with all the force of human love and the hope of heaven,\r\nwith all the tenderness in my heart that God has given to mothers. The\r\nsound of the child’s voice made me tremble. I used to watch him while\r\nhe slept with a sense of gladness that was always new, albeit a tear\r\nsometimes fell on his forehead; I taught him to come to say his prayer\r\nupon my bed as soon as he awoke. How sweet and touching were the simple\r\nwords of the _Pater noster_ in the innocent childish mouth! Ah! and at\r\ntimes how terrible! ‘_Our Father which art in heaven_,’ he began one\r\nmorning; then he paused--‘Why is it not _our mother_?’ he asked, and my\r\nheart sank at his words.\r\n\r\n“From the very first I had sown the seeds of future misfortune in\r\nthe life of the son whom I idolized. Although the law has almost\r\ncountenanced errors of youth by conceding to tardy regret a legal status\r\nto natural children, the insurmountable prejudices of society bring a\r\nstrong force to the support of the reluctance of the law. All serious\r\nreflection on my part as to the foundations and mechanism of society, on\r\nthe duties of man, and vital questions of morality date from this period\r\nof my life. Genius comprehends at first sight the connection between a\r\nman’s principles and the fate of the society of which he forms a part;\r\ndevout souls are inspired by religion with the sentiments necessary for\r\ntheir happiness; but vehement and impulsive natures can only be schooled\r\nby repentance. With repentance came new light for me; and I, who only\r\nlived for my child, came through that child to think over great social\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n“I determined from the first that he should have all possible means of\r\nsuccess within himself, and that he should be thoroughly prepared to\r\ntake the high position for which I destined him. He learned English,\r\nGerman, Italian, and Spanish in succession; and, that he might speak\r\nthese languages correctly, tutors belonging to each of these various\r\nnationalities were successively placed about him from his earliest\r\nchildhood. His aptitude delighted me. I took advantage of it to give\r\nhim lessons in the guise of play. I wished to keep his mind free from\r\nfallacies, and strove before all things to accustom him from childhood\r\nto exert his intellectual powers, to make a rapid and accurate general\r\nsurvey of a matter, and then, by a careful study of every least\r\nparticular, to master his subject in detail. Lastly, I taught him to\r\nsubmit to discipline without murmuring. I never allowed an impure or\r\nimproper word to be spoken in his hearing. I was careful that all his\r\nsurroundings, and the men with whom he came in contact, should conduce\r\nto one end--to ennoble his nature, to set lofty ideals before him, to\r\ngive him a love of truth and a horror of lies, to make him simple and\r\nnatural in manner, as in word and deed. His natural aptitude had made\r\nhis other studies easy to him, and his imagination made him quick to\r\ngrasp these lessons that lay outside the province of the schoolroom.\r\nWhat a fair flower to tend! How great are the joys that mothers know!\r\nIn those days I began to understand how his own mother had been able to\r\nlive and to bear her sorrow. This, sir, was the great event of my life;\r\nand now I am coming to the tragedy which drove me hither.\r\n\r\n“It is the most ordinary commonplace story imaginable; but to me it\r\nmeant the most terrible pain. For some years I had thought of nothing\r\nbut my child, and how to make a man of him; then, when my son was\r\ngrowing up and about to leave me, I grew afraid of my loneliness. Love\r\nwas a necessity of my existence; this need for affection had never been\r\nsatisfied, and only grew stronger with years. I was in every way capable\r\nof a real attachment; I had been tried and proved. I knew all that\r\na steadfast love means, the love that delights to find a pleasure in\r\nself-sacrifice; in everything I did my first thought would always be\r\nfor the woman I loved. In imagination I was fain to dwell on the serene\r\nheights far above doubt and uncertainty, where love so fills two beings\r\nthat happiness flows quietly and evenly into their life, their looks,\r\nand words. Such love is to a life what religion is to the soul; a vital\r\nforce, a power that enlightens and upholds. I understood the love of\r\nhusband and wife in nowise as most people do; for me its full beauty and\r\nmagnificence began precisely at the point where love perishes in many a\r\nhousehold. I deeply felt the moral grandeur of a life so closely shared\r\nby two souls that the trivialities of everyday existence should be\r\npowerless against such lasting love as theirs. But where will the hearts\r\nbe found whose beats are so nearly _isochronous_ (let the scientific\r\nterm pass) that they may attain to this beatific union? If they exist,\r\nnature and chance have set them far apart, so that they cannot come\r\ntogether; they find each other too late, or death comes too soon to\r\nseparate them. There must be some good reasons for these dispensations\r\nof fate, but I have never sought to discover them. I cannot make a\r\nstudy of my wound, because I suffer too much from it. Perhaps perfect\r\nhappiness is a monster which our species should not perpetuate. There\r\nwere other causes for my fervent desire for such a marriage as this. I\r\nhad no friends, the world for me was a desert. There is something in me\r\nthat repels friendship. More than one person has sought me out, but, in\r\nspite of efforts on my part, it came to nothing. With many men I have\r\nbeen careful to show no sign of something that is called ‘superiority;’\r\nI have adapted my mind to theirs; I have placed myself at their point of\r\nview, joined in their laughter, and overlooked their defects; any fame I\r\nmight have gained, I would have bartered for a little kindly affection.\r\nThey parted from me without regret. If you seek for real feeling in\r\nParis, snares await you everywhere, and the end is sorrow. Wherever I\r\nset my foot, the ground round about me seemed to burn. My readiness to\r\nacquiesce was considered weakness though if I unsheathed my talons, like\r\na man conscious that he may some day wield the thunderbolts of power, I\r\nwas thought ill-natured; to others, the delightful laughter that\r\nceases with youth, and in which in later years we are almost ashamed to\r\nindulge, seemed absurd, and they amused themselves at my expense. People\r\nmay be bored nowadays, but none the less they expect you to treat every\r\ntrivial topic with befitting seriousness.\r\n\r\n“A hateful era! You must bow down before mediocrity, frigidly polite\r\nmediocrity which you despise--and obey. On more mature reflection, I\r\nhave discovered the reasons of these glaring inconsistencies. Mediocrity\r\nis never out of fashion, it is the daily wear of society; genius and\r\neccentricity are ornaments that are locked away and only brought out on\r\ncertain days. Everything that ventures forth beyond the protection of\r\nthe grateful shadow of mediocrity has something startling about it.\r\n\r\n“So, in the midst of Paris, I led a solitary life. I had given up\r\neverything to society, but it had given me nothing in return; and my\r\nchild was not enough to satisfy my heart, because I was not a woman. My\r\nlife seemed to be growing cold within me; I was bending under a load of\r\nsecret misery when I met the woman who was to make me know the might of\r\nlove, the reverence of an acknowledged love, love with its teeming hopes\r\nof happiness--in one word--love.\r\n\r\n“I had renewed my acquaintance with that old friend of my father’s who\r\nhad once taken charge of my affairs. It was in his house that I first\r\nmet her whom I must love as long as life shall last. The longer we live,\r\nsir, the more clearly we see the enormous influence of ideas upon the\r\nevents of life. Prejudices, worthy of all respect, and bred by noble\r\nreligious ideas, occasioned my misfortunes. This young girl belonged to\r\nan exceeding devout family, whose views of Catholicism were due to the\r\nspirit of a sect improperly styled Jansenists, which, in former times,\r\ncaused troubles in France. You know why?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres, once wrote a book which was believed to\r\ncontain propositions at variance with the doctrines of the Holy See.\r\nWhen examined at a later date, there appeared to be nothing heretical in\r\nthe wording of the text, some authors even went so far as to deny that\r\nthe heretical propositions had any real existence. However it was,\r\nthese insignificant disputes gave rise to two parties in the Gallican\r\nChurch--the Jansenists and the Jesuits. Great men were found in either\r\ncamp, and a struggle began between two powerful bodies. The Jansenists\r\naffected an excessive purity of morals and of doctrine, and accused the\r\nJesuits of preaching a relaxed morality. The Jansenists, in fact, were\r\nCatholic Puritans, if two contradictory terms can be combined. During\r\nthe Revolution, the Concordat occasioned an unimportant schism, a little\r\nsegregation of ultra-catholics who refused to recognize the Bishops\r\nappointed by the authorities with the consent of the Pope. This little\r\nbody of the faithful was called the Little Church; and those within its\r\nfold, like the Jansenists, led the strictly ordered lives that appear\r\nto be a first necessity of existence in all proscribed and persecuted\r\nsects. Many Jansenist families had joined the Little Church. The\r\nfamily to which this young girl belonged had embraced the equally rigid\r\ndoctrines of both these Puritanisms, tenets which impart a stern dignity\r\nto the character and mien of those who hold them. It is the nature of\r\npositive doctrine to exaggerate the importance of the most ordinary\r\nactions of life by connecting them with ideas of a future existence.\r\nThis is the source of a splendid and delicate purity of heart, a respect\r\nfor others and for self, of an indescribably keen sense of right and\r\nwrong, a wide charity, together with a justice so stern that it might\r\nwell be called inexorable, and lastly, a perfect hatred of lies and of\r\nall the vices comprised by falsehood.\r\n\r\n“I can recall no more delightful moments than those of our first meeting\r\nat my old friend’s house. I beheld for the first time this shy young\r\ngirl with her sincere nature, her habits of ready obedience. All the\r\nvirtues peculiar to the sect to which she belonged shone in her, but\r\nshe seemed to be unconscious of her merit. There was a grace, which no\r\nausterity could diminish, about every movement of her lissome, slender\r\nform; her quiet brow, the delicate grave outlines of her face, and her\r\nclearly cut features indicated noble birth; her expression was gentle\r\nand proud; her thick hair had been simply braided, the coronet of plaits\r\nabout her head served, all unknown to her, as an adornment. Captain, she\r\nwas for me the ideal type that is always made real for us in the woman\r\nwith whom we fall in love; for when we love, is it not because we\r\nrecognize beauty that we have dreamed of, the beauty that has existed\r\nin idea for us is realized? When I spoke to her, she answered simply,\r\nwithout shyness or eagerness; she did not know the pleasure it was to\r\nme to see her, to hear the musical sounds of her voice. All these angels\r\nare revealed to our hearts by the same signs; by the sweetness of their\r\ntongues, the tenderness in their eyes, by their fair, pale faces, and\r\ntheir gracious ways. All these things are so blended and mingled that\r\nwe feel the charm of their presence, yet cannot tell in what that charm\r\nconsists, and every movement is an expression of a divine soul within.\r\nI loved passionately. This newly awakened love satisfied all my restless\r\nlongings, all my ambitious dreams. She was beautiful, wealthy, and nobly\r\nborn; she had been carefully brought up; she had all the qualifications\r\nwhich the world positively demands of a woman placed in the high\r\nposition which I desired to reach; she had been well educated, she\r\nexpressed herself with a sprightly facility at once rare and common\r\nin France; where the most prettily worded phrases of many women are\r\nemptiness itself, while her bright talk was full of sense. Above all,\r\nshe had a deep consciousness of her own dignity which made others\r\nrespect her; I know of no more excellent thing in a wife. I must stop,\r\ncaptain; no one can describe the woman he loves save very imperfectly,\r\npreexistent mysteries which defy analysis lie between them.\r\n\r\n“I very soon took my old friend into my confidence. He introduced me to\r\nher family, and gave me the countenance of his honorable character. I\r\nwas received at first with the frigid politeness characteristic of those\r\nexclusive people who never forsake those whom they have once admitted to\r\ntheir friendship. As time went on they welcomed me almost as one of the\r\nfamily; this mark of their esteem was won by my behavior in the matter.\r\nIn spite of my passionate love, I did nothing that could lower me in my\r\nown eyes; I did not cringe, I paid no court to those upon whom my fate\r\ndepended, before all things I showed myself a man, and not other than\r\nI really was. When I was well known to them, my old friend, who was as\r\ndesirous as I myself that my life of melancholy loneliness should come\r\nto an end, spoke of my hopes and met with a favorable reception; but\r\nwith the diplomatic shrewdness which is almost a second nature with men\r\nof the world, he was silent with regard to an error of my youth, as he\r\ntermed it. He was anxious to bring about a ‘satisfactory marriage’ for\r\nme, an expression that makes of so solemn an act a business transaction\r\nin which husband and wife endeavor to cheat each other. In his opinion,\r\nthe existence of my child would excite a moral repugnance, in comparison\r\nwith which the question of money would be as nought, and the whole\r\naffair would be broken off at once, and he was right.\r\n\r\n“‘It is a matter which will be very easily settled between you and your\r\nwife; it will be easy to obtain her full and free forgiveness,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“In short, he tried to silence my scruples, and all the insidious\r\narguments that worldly wisdom could suggest were brought to bear upon me\r\nto this end. I will confess to you, sir, that in spite of my promise, my\r\nfirst impulse was to act straightforwardly and to make everything\r\nknown to the head of the family, but the thought of his uncompromising\r\nsternness made me pause, and the probable consequences of the confession\r\nappalled me; my courage failed, I temporized with my conscience, I\r\ndetermined to wait until I was sufficiently sure of the affection of\r\nthe girl I hoped to win, before hazarding my happiness by the terrible\r\nconfession. My resolution to acknowledge everything openly, at a\r\nconvenient season, vindicated the sophistries of worldly wisdom and the\r\nsagacity of my old friend. So the young girl’s parents received me as\r\ntheir future son-in-law without, as yet, taking their friends into their\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n“An infinite discretion is the distinguishing quality of pious families;\r\nthey are reticent about everything, even about matters of no importance.\r\nYou would not believe, sir, how this sedate gravity and reserve,\r\npervading every least action, deepens the current of feeling and\r\nthought. Everything in that house was done with some useful end in view;\r\nthe women spent their leisure time in making garments for the poor;\r\ntheir conversation was never frivolous; laughter was not banished, but\r\nthere was a kindly simplicity about their merriment. Their talk had\r\nnone of the piquancy which scandal and ill-natured gossip give to the\r\nconversation of society; only the father and uncle read the newspapers,\r\neven the most harmless journal contains references to crimes or to\r\npublic evils, and she whom I hoped to win had never cast her eyes over\r\ntheir sheets. How strange it was, at first, to listen to these orthodox\r\npeople! But in a little while, the pure atmosphere left the same\r\nimpression upon the soul that subdued colors give to the eyes, a sense\r\nof serene repose and of tranquil peace.\r\n\r\n“To a superficial observer, their life would have seemed terribly\r\nmonotonous. There was something chilling about the appearance of the\r\ninterior of the house. Day after day I used to see everything, even the\r\nfurniture in constant use, always standing in the same place, and this\r\nuniform tidiness pervaded the smallest details. Yet there was something\r\nvery attractive about their household ways. I had been used to the\r\npleasures of variety, to the luxury and stir of life in Paris; it was\r\nonly when I had overcome my first repugnance that I saw the advantages\r\nof this existence; how it lent itself to continuity of thought and to\r\ninvoluntary meditation; how a life in which the heart has undisturbed\r\nsway seems to widen and grow vast as the sea. It is like the life of the\r\ncloister, where the outward surroundings never vary, and thought is\r\nthus compelled to detach itself from outward things and to turn to the\r\ninfinite that lies within the soul!\r\n\r\n“For a man as sincerely in love as I was, the silence and simplicity of\r\nthe life, the almost conventual regularity with which the same things\r\nare done daily at the same hours, only deepened and strengthened love.\r\nIn that profound calm the interest attaching to the least action, word,\r\nor gesture became immense. I learned to know that, in the interchange of\r\nglances and in answering smiles, there lies an eloquence and a variety\r\nof language far beyond the possibilities of the most magnificent of\r\nspoken phrases; that when the expression of the feelings is spontaneous\r\nand unforced, there is no idea, no joy nor sorrow that cannot thus be\r\ncommunicated by hearts that understand each other. How many times I have\r\ntried to set forth my soul in my eyes or on my lips, compelled at once\r\nto speak and to be silent concerning my passion; for the young girl who,\r\nin my presence, was always serene and unconscious had not been informed\r\nof the reason of my constant visits; her parents were determined that\r\nthe most important decision of her life should rest entirely with her.\r\nBut does not the presence of our beloved satisfy the utmost desire of\r\npassionate love? In that presence do we not know the happiness of the\r\nChristian who stands before God? If for me more than for any other it\r\nwas torture to have no right to give expression to the impulses of\r\nmy heart, to force back into its depths the burning words that\r\ntreacherously wrong the yet more ardent emotions which strive to find\r\nan utterance in speech; I found, nevertheless, in the merest trifles\r\na channel through which my passionate love poured itself forth but the\r\nmore vehemently for this constraint, till every least occurrence came to\r\nhave an excessive importance.\r\n\r\n“I beheld her, not for brief moments, but for whole hours. There were\r\npauses between my question and her answer, and long musings, when, with\r\nthe tones of her voice lingering in my ears, I sought to divine from\r\nthem the secret of her inmost thoughts; perhaps her fingers would\r\ntremble as I gave her some object of which she had been in search, or\r\nI would devise pretexts to lightly touch her dress or her hair, to take\r\nher hand in mine, to compel her to speak more than she wished; all these\r\nnothings were great events for me. Eyes and voice and gestures were\r\nfreighted with mysterious messages of love in hours of ecstasy like\r\nthese, and this was the only language permitted me by the quiet maidenly\r\nreserve of the young girl before me. Her manner towards me underwent no\r\nchange; with me she was always as a sister with a brother; yet, as my\r\npassion grew, and the contrast between her glances and mine, her words\r\nand my utterance, became more striking, I felt at last that this timid\r\nsilence was the only means by which she could express her feelings.\r\nWas she not always in the salon whenever I came? Did she not stay there\r\nuntil my visit, expected and perhaps foreseen, was over? Did not this\r\nmute tryst betray the secret of her innocent soul? Nay, whilst I spoke,\r\ndid she not listen with a pleasure which she could not hide?\r\n\r\n“At last, no doubt, her parents grew impatient with this artless\r\nbehavior and sober love-making. I was almost as timid as their daughter,\r\nand perhaps on this account found favor in their eyes. They regarded\r\nme as a man worthy of their esteem. My old friend was taken into their\r\nconfidence; both father and mother spoke of me in the most flattering\r\nterms; I had become their adopted son, and more especially they singled\r\nout my moral principles for praise. In truth, I had found my youth\r\nagain; among these pure and religious surroundings early beliefs and\r\nearly faith came back to the man of thirty-two.\r\n\r\n“The summer was drawing to a close. Affairs of some importance had\r\ndetained the family in Paris longer than their wont; but when September\r\ncame, and they were able to leave town at last for an estate in\r\nAuvergne, her father entreated me to spend a couple of months with them\r\nin an old chateau hidden away among the mountains of Cantal. I paused\r\nbefore accepting this friendly invitation. My hesitation brought me the\r\nsweetest and most delightful unconscious confession, a revelation of the\r\nmysteries of a girlish heart. Evelina... _Dieu!_” exclaimed Benassis;\r\nand he said no more for a time, wrapped in his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Captain Bluteau,” he resumed, after a long pause. “For\r\ntwelve years I have not uttered the name that is always hovering in my\r\nthoughts, that a voice calls in my hearing even when I sleep. Evelina\r\n(since I have named her) raised her head with a strange quickness and\r\nabruptness, for about all her movements there was an instinctive grace\r\nand gentleness, and looked at me. There was no pride in her face, but\r\nrather a wistful anxiety. Then her color rose, and her eyelids fell;\r\nit gave me an indescribable pleasure never felt before that they should\r\nfall so slowly; I could only stammer out my reply in a faltering voice.\r\nThe emotion of my own heart made swift answer to hers. She thanked me by\r\na happy look, and I almost thought that there were tears in her eyes.\r\nIn that moment we had told each other everything. So I went into the\r\ncountry with her family. Since the day when our hearts had understood\r\neach other, nothing seemed to be as it had been before; everything about\r\nus had acquired a fresh significance.\r\n\r\n“Love, indeed, is always the same, though our imagination determines\r\nthe shape that love must assume; like and unlike, therefore, is love\r\nin every soul in which he dwells, and passion becomes a unique work in\r\nwhich the soul expresses its sympathies. In the old trite saying that\r\nlove is a projection of self--an _egoisme a deux_--lies a profound\r\nmeaning known only to philosopher and poet; for it is ourself in truth\r\nthat we love in that other. Yet, though love manifests itself in such\r\ndifferent ways that no pair of lovers since the world began is like any\r\nother pair before or since, they all express themselves after the same\r\nfashion, and the same words are on the lips of every girl, even of the\r\nmost innocent, convent-bred maiden--the only difference lies in the\r\ndegree of imaginative charm in their ideas. But between Evelina and\r\nother girls there was this difference, that where another would have\r\npoured out her feelings quite naturally, Evelina regarded these innocent\r\nconfidences as a concession made to the stormy emotions which had\r\ninvaded the quiet sanctuary of her girlish soul. The constant struggle\r\nbetween her heart and her principles gave to the least event of her\r\nlife, so peaceful in appearance, in reality so profoundly agitated, a\r\ncharacter of force very superior to the exaggerations of young girls\r\nwhose manners are early rendered false by the world about them. All\r\nthrough the journey Evelina discovered beauty in the scenery through\r\nwhich we passed, and spoke of it with admiration. When we think that\r\nwe may not give expression to the happiness which is given to us by the\r\npresence of one we love, we pour out the secret gladness that overflows\r\nour hearts upon inanimate things, investing them with beauty in our\r\nhappiness. The charm of the scenery which passed before our eyes\r\nbecame in this way an interpreter between us, for in our praises of the\r\nlandscape we revealed to each other the secrets of our love. Evelina’s\r\nmother sometimes took a mischievous pleasure in disconcerting her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n“‘My dear child, you have been through this valley a score of times\r\nwithout seeming to admire it!’ she remarked after a somewhat too\r\nenthusiastic phrase from Evelina.\r\n\r\n“‘No doubt it was because I was not old enough to understand beauty of\r\nthis kind, mother.’\r\n\r\n“Forgive me for dwelling on this trifle, which can have no charm for\r\nyou, captain; but the simple words brought me an indescribable joy,\r\nwhich had its source in the glance directed towards me as she spoke. So\r\nsome village lighted by sunrise, some ivy-covered ruin which we had seen\r\ntogether, memories of outward and visible things, served to deepen and\r\nstrengthen the impressions of our happiness; they seemed to be landmarks\r\non the way through which we were passing towards a bright future that\r\nlay before us.\r\n\r\n“We reached the chateau belonging to her family, where I spent about\r\nsix weeks, the only time in my life during which Heaven has\r\nvouchsafed complete happiness to me. I enjoyed pleasures unknown to\r\ntown-dwellers--all the happiness which two lovers find in living beneath\r\nthe same roof, an anticipation of the life they will spend together. To\r\nstroll through the fields, to be alone together at times if we wished\r\nit, to look over an old water-mill, to sit beneath a tree in some lovely\r\nglen among the hills, the lovers’ talks, the sweet confidences drawn\r\nforth by which each made some progress day by day in the other’s heart.\r\nAh! sir, the out-of-door life, the beauty of earth and heaven, is a\r\nperfect accompaniment to the perfect happiness of the soul! To mingle\r\nour careless talk with the song of the birds among the dewy leaves, to\r\nsmile at each other as we gazed on the sky, to turn our steps slowly\r\nhomewards at the sound of the bell that always rings too soon, to\r\nadmire together some little detail in the landscape, to watch the\r\nfitful movements of an insect, to look closely at a gleaming demoiselle\r\nfly--the delicate creature that resembles an innocent and loving girl;\r\nin such ways as these are not one’s thoughts drawn daily a little\r\nhigher? The memories of my forty days of happiness have in a manner\r\ncolored all the rest of my life, memories that are all the fairer and\r\nfill the greater space in my thoughts because since then it has been my\r\nfate never to be understood. To this day there are scenes of no special\r\ninterest for a casual observer, but full of bitter significance for a\r\nbroken heart, which recall those vanished days, and the love that is not\r\nforgotten yet.\r\n\r\n“I do not know whether you noticed the effect of the sunset light on the\r\ncottage where little Jacques lives? Everything shone so brightly in the\r\nfiery rays of the sun, and then all at once the whole landscape grew\r\ndark and dreary. That sudden change was like the change in my own life\r\nat this time. I received from her the first, the sole and sublime token\r\nof love that an innocent girl may give; the more secretly it is given,\r\nthe closer is the bond it forms, the sweet promise of love, a fragment\r\nof the language spoken in a fairer world than this. Sure, therefore, of\r\nbeing beloved, I vowed that I would confess everything at once, that\r\nI would have no secrets from her; I felt ashamed that I had so long\r\ndelayed to tell her about the sorrows that I had brought upon myself.\r\n\r\n“Unluckily, with the morrow of this happy day a letter came from my\r\nson’s tutor, the life of the child so dear to me was in danger. I went\r\naway without confiding my secret to Evelina, merely telling her family\r\nthat I was urgently required in Paris. Her parents took alarm during my\r\nabsence. They feared that there I was entangled in some way, and wrote\r\nto Paris to make inquiries about me. It was scarcely consistent with\r\ntheir religious principles; but they suspected me, and did not even give\r\nme an opportunity of clearing myself.\r\n\r\n“One of their friends, without my knowledge, gave them the whole history\r\nof my youth, blackening my errors, laying stress upon the existence of\r\nmy child, which (said they) I intended to conceal. I wrote to my future\r\nparents, but I received no answers to my letters; and when they came\r\nback to Paris, and I called at their house, I was not admitted. Much\r\nalarmed, I sent to my old friend to learn the reason of this conduct on\r\ntheir part, which I did not in the least understand. As soon as the good\r\nsoul knew the real cause of it all, he sacrificed himself generously,\r\ntook upon himself all the blame of my reserve, and tried to exculpate\r\nme, but all to no purpose. Questions of interest and morality were\r\nregarded so seriously by the family, their prejudices were so firmly and\r\ndeeply rooted, that they never swerved from their resolution. My despair\r\nwas overwhelming. At first I tried to deprecate their wrath, but my\r\nletters were sent back to me unopened. When every possible means had\r\nbeen tried in vain; when her father and mother had plainly told my old\r\nfriend (the cause of my misfortune) that they would never consent to\r\ntheir daughter’s marriage with a man who had upon his conscience the\r\ndeath of a woman and the life of a natural son, even though Evelina\r\nherself should implore them upon her knees; then, sir, there only\r\nremained to me one last hope, a hope as slender and fragile as the\r\nwillow-branch at which a drowning wretch catches to save himself.\r\n\r\n“I ventured to think that Evelina’s love would be stronger than her\r\nfather’s scruples, that her inflexible parents might yield to her\r\nentreaties. Perhaps, who knows, her father had kept from her the reasons\r\nof the refusal, which was so fatal to our love. I determined to acquaint\r\nher with all the circumstances, and to make a final appeal to her; and\r\nin fear and trembling, in grief and tears, my first and last love-letter\r\nwas written. To-day I can only dimly remember the words dictated to\r\nme by my despair; but I must have told Evelina that if she had dealt\r\nsincerely with me she could not and ought not to love another, or how\r\ncould her whole life be anything but a lie? she must be false either to\r\nher future husband or to me. Could she refuse to the lover, who had been\r\nso misjudged and hardly entreated, the devotion which she would have\r\nshown him as her husband, if the marriage which had already taken place\r\nin our hearts had been outwardly solemnized? Was not this to fall from\r\nthe ideal of womanly virtue? What woman would not love to feel that\r\nthe promises of the heart were more sacred and binding than the chains\r\nforged by the law? I defended my errors; and in my appeal to the\r\npurity of innocence, I left nothing unsaid that could touch a noble and\r\ngenerous nature. But as I am telling you everything, I will look for\r\nher answer and my farewell letter,” said Benassis, and he went up to his\r\nroom in search of it.\r\n\r\nHe returned in a few moments with a worn pocketbook; his hands trembled\r\nwith emotion as he drew from it some loose sheets.\r\n\r\n“Here is the fatal letter,” he said. “The girl who wrote those lines\r\nlittle knew the value that I should set upon the scrap of paper that\r\nholds her thoughts. This is the last cry that pain wrung from me,” he\r\nadded, taking up a second letter; “I will lay it before you directly.\r\nMy old friend was the bearer of my letter of entreaty; he gave it to\r\nher without her parents’ knowledge, humbling his white hair to implore\r\nEvelina to read and to reply to my appeal. This was her answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Monsieur...’ But lately I had been her ‘beloved,’ the innocent name\r\nshe had found by which to express her innocent love, and now she called\r\nme _Monsieur_!... That one word told me everything. But listen to the\r\nrest of the letter:\r\n\r\n“‘Treachery on the part of one to whom her life was to be intrusted is a\r\nbitter thing for a girl to discover; and yet I could not but excuse you,\r\nwe are so weak! Your letter touched me, but you must not write to me\r\nagain, the sight of your handwriting gives me such unbearable pain.\r\nWe are parted for ever. I was carried away by your reasoning; it\r\nextinguished all the harsh feelings that had risen up against you in my\r\nsoul. I had been so proud of your truth! But both of us have found my\r\nfather’s reasoning irresistible. Yes, monsieur, I ventured to plead\r\nfor you. I did for you what I have never done before, I overcame the\r\ngreatest fears that I have ever known, and acted almost against my\r\nnature. Even now I am yielding to your entreaties, and doing wrong for\r\nyour sake, in writing to you without my father’s knowledge. My mother\r\nknows that I am writing to you; her indulgence in leaving me at liberty\r\nto be alone with you for a moment has taught me the depth of her love\r\nfor me, and strengthened my determination to bow to the decree of my\r\nfamily, against which I had almost rebelled. So I am writing to you,\r\nmonsieur, for the first and last time. You have my full and entire\r\nforgiveness for the troubles that you have brought into my life. Yes,\r\nyou are right; a first love can never be forgotten. I am no longer an\r\ninnocent girl; and, as an honest woman, I can never marry another. What\r\nmy future will be, I know not therefore. Only you see, monsieur, that\r\nechoes of this year that you have filled will never die away in my life.\r\nBut I am in no way accusing you.... “I shall always be beloved!” Why did\r\nyou write those words? Can they bring peace to the troubled soul of\r\na lonely and unhappy girl? Have you not already laid waste my future,\r\ngiving me memories which will never cease to revisit me? Henceforth I\r\ncan only give myself to God, but will He accept a broken heart? He has\r\nhad some purpose to fulfil in sending these afflictions to me; doubtless\r\nit was His will that I should turn to Him, my only refuge here below.\r\nNothing remains to me here upon this earth. You have all a man’s\r\nambitions wherewith to beguile your sorrows. I do not say this as a\r\nreproach; it is a sort of religious consolation. If we both bear a\r\ngrievous burden at this moment, I think that my share of it is the\r\nheavier. He in whom I have put my trust, and of whom you can feel\r\nno jealousy, has joined our lives together, and He puts them asunder\r\naccording to His will. I have seen that your religious beliefs were not\r\nfounded upon the pure and living faith which alone enables us to bear\r\nour woes here below. Monsieur, if God will vouchsafe to hear my fervent\r\nand ceaseless prayers, He will cause His light to shine in your soul.\r\nFarewell, you who should have been my guide, you whom once I had the\r\nright to call “my beloved,” no one can reproach me if I pray for you\r\nstill. God orders our days as it pleases Him. Perhaps you may be the\r\nfirst whom He will call to himself; but if I am left alone in the world,\r\nthen, monsieur, intrust the care of the child to me.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“This letter, so full of generous sentiments, disappointed my hopes,”\r\n Benassis resumed, “so that at first I could think of nothing but my\r\nmisery; afterwards I welcomed the balm which, in her forgetfulness of\r\nself, she had tried to pour into my wounds, but in my first despair I\r\nwrote to her somewhat bitterly:\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle--that word alone will tell you that at your bidding I\r\nrenounce you. There is something indescribably sweet in obeying one\r\nwe love, who puts us to the torture. You are right. I acquiesce in\r\nmy condemnation. Once I slighted a girl’s devotion; it is fitting,\r\ntherefore, that my love should be rejected to-day. But I little thought\r\nthat my punishment was to be dealt to me by the woman at whose feet I\r\nhad laid my life. I never expected that such harshness, perhaps I should\r\nsay, such rigid virtue, lurked in a heart that seemed to be so loving\r\nand so tender. At this moment the full strength of my love is revealed\r\nto me; it has survived the most terrible of all trials, the scorn you\r\nhave shown for me by severing without regret the ties that bound us.\r\nFarewell for ever. There still remains to me the proud humility of\r\nrepentance; I will find some sphere of life where I can expiate the\r\nerrors to which you, the mediator between Heaven and me, have shown no\r\nmercy. Perhaps God may be less inexorable. My sufferings, sufferings\r\nfull of the thought of you, shall be the penance of a heart which\r\nwill never be healed, which will bleed in solitude. For a wounded\r\nheart--shadow and silence.\r\n\r\n“‘No other image of love shall be engraven on my heart. Though I am not\r\na woman, I feel as you felt that when I said “I love you,” it was a vow\r\nfor life. Yes, the words then spoken in the ear of “my beloved” were\r\nnot a lie; you would have a right to scorn me if I could change. I shall\r\nnever cease to worship you in my solitude. In spite of the gulf set\r\nbetween us, you will still be the mainspring of all my actions, and all\r\nthe virtues are inspired by penitence and love. Though you have filled\r\nmy heart with bitterness, I shall never have bitter thoughts of you;\r\nwould it not be an ill beginning of the new tasks that I have set myself\r\nif I did not purge out all the evil leaven from my soul? Farewell, then,\r\nto the one heart that I love in the world, a heart from which I am cast\r\nout. Never has more feeling and more tenderness been expressed in a\r\nfarewell, for is it not fraught with the life and soul of one who can\r\nnever hope again, and must be henceforth as one dead?... Farewell. May\r\npeace be with you, and may all the sorrow of our lot fall to me!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenassis and Genestas looked at each other for a moment after reading\r\nthe two letters, each full of sad thoughts, of which neither spoke.\r\n\r\n“As you see, this is only a rough copy of my last letter,” said\r\nBenassis; “it is all that remains to me to-day of my blighted hopes.\r\nWhen I had sent the letter, I fell into an indescribable state of\r\ndepression. All the ties that hold one to life were bound together in\r\nthe hope of wedded happiness, which was henceforth lost to me for ever.\r\nI had to bid farewell to the joys of a permitted and acknowledged love,\r\nto all the generous ideas that had thronged up from the depths of my\r\nheart. The prayers of a penitent soul that thirsted for righteousness\r\nand for all things lovely and of good report, had been rejected by these\r\nreligious people. At first, the wildest resolutions and most frantic\r\nthoughts surged through my mind, but happily for me the sight of my son\r\nbrought self-control. I felt all the more strongly drawn towards him for\r\nthe misfortunes of which he was the innocent cause, and for which I had\r\nin reality only myself to blame. In him I found all my consolation.\r\n\r\n“At the age of thirty-four I might still hope to do my country noble\r\nservice. I determined to make a name for myself, a name so illustrious\r\nthat no one should remember the stain on the birth of my son. How many\r\nnoble thoughts I owe to him! How full a life I led in those days while\r\nI was absorbed in planning out his future! I feel stifled,” cried\r\nBenassis. “All this happened eleven years ago, and yet to this day, I\r\ncannot bear to think of that fatal year.... My child died, sir; I lost\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was silent, and hid his face in his hands; when he was\r\nsomewhat calmer he raised his head again, and Genestas saw that his eyes\r\nwere full of tears.\r\n\r\n“At first it seemed as if this thunderbolt had uprooted me,” Benassis\r\nresumed. “It was a blow from which I could only expect to recover after\r\nI had been transplanted into a different soil from that of the social\r\nworld in which I lived. It was not till some time afterwards that I saw\r\nthe finger of God in my misfortunes, and later still that I learned to\r\nsubmit to His will and to hearken to His voice. It was impossible that\r\nresignation should come to me all at once. My impetuous and fiery nature\r\nbroke out in a final storm of rebellion.\r\n\r\n“It was long before I brought myself to take the only step befitting\r\na Catholic; indeed, my thoughts ran on suicide. This succession of\r\nmisfortunes had contributed to develop melancholy feelings in me, and I\r\ndeliberately determined to take my own life. It seemed to me that it was\r\npermissible to take leave of life when life was ebbing fast. There\r\nwas nothing unnatural, I thought about suicide. The ravages of mental\r\ndistress affected the soul of man in the same way that acute physical\r\nanguish affected the body; and an intelligent being, suffering from a\r\nmoral malady, had surely a right to destroy himself, a right he shares\r\nwith the sheep, that, fallen a victim to the ‘staggers,’ beats its head\r\nagainst a tree. Were the soul’s diseases in truth more readily cured\r\nthan those of the body? I scarcely think so, to this day. Nor do I know\r\nwhich is the more craven soul--he who hopes even when hope is no longer\r\npossible, or he who despairs. Death is the natural termination of a\r\nphysical malady, and it seemed to me that suicide was the final crisis\r\nin the sufferings of a mind diseased, for it was in the power of the\r\nwill to end them when reason showed that death was preferable to\r\nlife. So it is not the pistol, but a thought that puts an end to our\r\nexistence. Again, when fate may suddenly lay us low in the midst of a\r\nhappy life, can we be blamed for ourselves refusing to bear a life of\r\nmisery?\r\n\r\n“But my reflections during that time of mourning turned on loftier\r\nthemes. The grandeur of pagan philosophy attracted me, and for a while\r\nI became a convert. In my efforts to discover new rights for man, I\r\nthought that with the aid of modern thought I could penetrate further\r\ninto the questions to which those old-world systems of philosophy had\r\nfurnished solutions.\r\n\r\n“Epicurus permitted suicide. Was it not the natural outcome of his\r\nsystem of ethics? The gratification of the senses was to be obtained at\r\nany cost; and when this became impossible, the easiest and best course\r\nwas for the animate being to return to the repose of inanimate nature.\r\nHappiness, or the hope of happiness, was the one end for which man\r\nexisted, for one who suffered, and who suffered without hope, death\r\nceased to be an evil, and became a good, and suicide became a final act\r\nof wisdom. This act Epicurus neither blamed nor praised; he was content\r\nto say as he poured a libation to Bacchus, ‘_As for death, there is\r\nnothing in death to move our laughter or our tears._’\r\n\r\n“With a loftier morality than that of the Epicureans, and a sterner\r\nsense of man’s duties, Zeno and the Stoic philosophers prescribed\r\nsuicide in certain cases to their followers. They reasoned thus: Man\r\ndiffers from the brute in that he has the sovereign right to dispose of\r\nhis person; take away this power of life and death over himself and\r\nhe becomes the plaything of fate, the slave of other men. Rightly\r\nunderstood, this power of life and death is a sufficient counterpoise\r\nfor all the ills of life; the same power when conferred upon another,\r\nupon his fellow-man, leads to tyranny of every kind. Man has no power\r\nwhatever unless he has unlimited freedom of action. Suppose that he has\r\nbeen guilty of some irreparable error, from the shameful consequences of\r\nwhich there is no escape; a sordid nature swallows down the disgrace and\r\nsurvives it, the wise man drinks the hemlock and dies. Suppose that the\r\nremainder of life is to be one constant struggle with the gout which\r\nracks our bones, or with a gnawing and disfiguring cancer, the wise man\r\ndismisses quacks, and at the proper moment bids a last farewell to the\r\nfriends whom he only saddens by his presence. Or another perhaps has\r\nfallen alive into the hands of the tyrant against whom he fought. What\r\nshall he do? The oath of allegiance is tendered to him; he must either\r\nsubscribe or stretch out his neck to the executioner; the fool takes the\r\nlatter course, the coward subscribes, the wise man strikes a last blow\r\nfor liberty--in his own heart. ‘You who are free,’ the Stoic was wont to\r\nsay, ‘know then how to preserve your freedom! Find freedom from your\r\nown passions by sacrificing them to duty, freedom from the tyranny of\r\nmankind by pointing to the sword or the poison which will put you beyond\r\ntheir reach, freedom from the bondage of fate by determining the point\r\nbeyond which you will endure it no longer, freedom from physical fear by\r\nlearning how to subdue the gross instinct which causes so many wretches\r\nto cling to life.’\r\n\r\n“After I had unearthed this reasoning from among a heap of ancient\r\nphilosophical writings, I sought to reconcile it with Christian\r\nteachings. God has bestowed free-will upon us in order to require of\r\nus an account hereafter before the Throne of Judgment. ‘I will plead\r\nmy cause there!’ I said to myself. But such thoughts as these led me to\r\nthink of a life after death, and my old shaken beliefs rose up before\r\nme. Human life grows solemn when all eternity hangs upon the slightest\r\nof our decisions. When the full meaning of this thought is realized, the\r\nsoul becomes conscious of something vast and mysterious within itself,\r\nby which it is drawn towards the Infinite; the aspect of all things\r\nalters strangely. From this point of view life is something infinitely\r\ngreat and infinitely little. The consciousness of my sins had never made\r\nme think of heaven so long as hope remained to me on earth, so long as I\r\ncould find a relief for my woes in work and in the society of other men.\r\nI had meant to make the happiness of a woman’s life, to love, to be the\r\nhead of a family, and in this way my need of expiation would have been\r\nsatisfied to the full. This design had been thwarted, but yet another\r\nway had remained to me,--I would devote myself henceforward to my child.\r\nBut after these two efforts had failed, and scorn and death had darkened\r\nmy soul for ever, when all my feelings had been wounded and nothing was\r\nleft to me here on earth, I raised my eyes to heaven, and beheld God.\r\n\r\n“Yet still I tried to obtain the sanction of religion for my death.\r\nI went carefully through the Gospels, and found no passage in which\r\nsuicide was forbidden; but during the reading, the divine thought of\r\nChrist, the Saviour of men dawned in me. Certainly He had said nothing\r\nabout the immortality of the soul, but He had spoken of the glorious\r\nkingdom of His Father; He had nowhere forbidden parricide, but He\r\ncondemned all that was evil. The glory of His evangelists, and the proof\r\nof their divine mission, is not so much that they made laws for the\r\nworld, but that they spread a new spirit abroad, and the new laws were\r\nfilled with this new spirit. The very courage which a man displays in\r\ntaking his own life seemed to me to be his condemnation; so long as he\r\nfelt that he had within himself sufficient strength to die by his own\r\nhands, he ought to have had strength enough to continue the struggle.\r\nTo refuse to suffer is a sign of weakness rather than of courage,\r\nand, moreover, was it not a sort of recusance to take leave of life in\r\ndespondency, an abjuration of the Christian faith which is based upon\r\nthe sublime words of Jesus Christ: ‘Blessed are they that mourn.’\r\n\r\n“So, in any case, suicide seemed to me to be an unpardonable error, even\r\nin the man who, through a false conception of greatness of soul, takes\r\nhis life a few moments before the executioner’s axe falls. In humbling\r\nhimself to the death of the cross, did not Jesus Christ set for us an\r\nexample of obedience to all human laws, even when carried out unjustly?\r\nThe word _resignation_ engraved upon the cross, so clear to the eyes of\r\nthose who can read the sacred characters in which it is traced, shone\r\nfor me with divine brightness.\r\n\r\n“I still had eighty thousand francs in my possession, and at first I\r\nmeant to live a remote and solitary life, to vegetate in some country\r\ndistrict for the rest of my days; but misanthropy is no Catholic virtue,\r\nand there is a certain vanity lurking beneath the hedgehog’s skin of the\r\nmisanthrope. His heart does not bleed, it shrivels, and my heart bled\r\nfrom every vein. I thought of the discipline of the Church, the refuge\r\nthat she affords to sorrowing souls, understood at last the beauty of\r\na life of prayer in solitude, and was fully determined to ‘enter\r\nreligion,’ in the grand old phrase. So far my intentions were firmly\r\nfixed, but I had not yet decided on the best means of carrying them out.\r\nI realized the remains of my fortune, and set forth on my journey with\r\nan almost tranquil mind. _Peace in God_ was a hope that could never fail\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“I felt drawn to the rule of Saint Bruno, and made the journey to the\r\nGrande Chartreuse on foot, absorbed in solemn thoughts. That was a\r\nmemorable day. I was not prepared for the grandeur of the scenery; the\r\nworkings of an unknown Power greater than that of man were visible at\r\nevery step; the overhanging crags, the precipices on either hand,\r\nthe stillness only broken by the voices of the mountain streams, the\r\nsternness and wildness of the landscape, relieved here and there by\r\nNature’s fairest creations, pine trees that have stood for centuries\r\nand delicate rock plants at their feet, all combine to produce sober\r\nmusings. There seemed to be no end to this waste solitude, shut in by\r\nits lofty mountain barriers. The idle curiosity of man could scarcely\r\npenetrate there. It would be difficult to cross this melancholy desert\r\nof Saint Bruno’s with a light heart.\r\n\r\n“I saw the Grand Chartreuse. I walked beneath the vaulted roofs of the\r\nancient cloisters, and heard in the silence the sound of the water from\r\nthe spring, falling drop by drop. I entered a cell that I might the\r\nbetter realize my own utter nothingness, something of the peace that my\r\npredecessor had found there seemed to pass into my soul. An inscription,\r\nwhich in accordance with the custom of the monastery he had written\r\nabove his door, impressed and touched me; all the precepts of the\r\nlife that I had meant to lead were there, summed up in three Latin\r\nwords--_Fuge, late, tace_.”\r\n\r\nGenestas bent his head as if he understood.\r\n\r\n“My decision was made,” Benassis resumed. “The cell with its deal\r\nwainscot, the hard bed, the solitude, all appealed to my soul. The\r\nCarthusians were in the chapel, I went thither to join in their prayers,\r\nand there my resolutions vanished. I do not wish to criticise the\r\nCatholic Church, I am perfectly orthodox, I believe in its laws and in\r\nthe works it prescribes. But when I heard the chanting and the prayers\r\nof those old men, dead to the world and forgotten by the world, I\r\ndiscerned an undercurrent of sublime egoism in the life of the cloister.\r\nThis withdrawal from the world could only benefit the individual soul,\r\nand after all what was it but a protracted suicide? I do not condemn it.\r\nThe Church has opened these tombs in which life is buried; no doubt they\r\nare needful for those few Christians who are absolutely useless to\r\nthe world; but for me, it would be better, I thought, to live among my\r\nfellows, to devote my life of expiation to their service.\r\n\r\n“As I returned I thought long and carefully over the various ways in\r\nwhich I could carry out my vow of renunciation. Already I began, in\r\nfancy, to lead the life of a common sailor, condemning myself to serve\r\nour country in the lowest ranks, and giving up all my intellectual\r\nambitions; but though it was a life of toil and of self-abnegation, it\r\nseemed to me that I ought to do more than this. Should I not thwart the\r\ndesigns of God by leading such a life? If He had given me intellectual\r\nability, was it not my duty to employ it for the good of my fellow-men?\r\nThen, besides, if I am to speak frankly, I felt within me a need of my\r\nfellow-men, an indescribable wish to help them. The round of mechanical\r\nduties and the routine tasks of the sailor afforded no scope for this\r\ndesire, which is as much an outcome of my nature as the characteristic\r\nscent that a flower breathes forth.\r\n\r\n“I was obliged to spend the night here, as I have already told you.\r\nThe wretched condition of the countryside had filled me with pity, and\r\nduring the night it seemed as if these thoughts had been sent to me by\r\nGod, and that thus He had revealed His will to me. I had known something\r\nof the joys that pierce the heart, the happiness and the sorrow of\r\nmotherhood; I determined that henceforth my life should be filled with\r\nthese, but that mine should be a wider sphere than a mother’s. I would\r\nexpend her care and kindness on the whole district; I would be a\r\nsister of charity, and bind the wounds of all the suffering poor in a\r\ncountryside. It seemed to me that the finger of God unmistakably pointed\r\nout my destiny; and when I remembered that my first serious thoughts\r\nin youth had inclined me to the study of medicine, I resolved to\r\nsettle here as a doctor. Besides, I had another reason. _For a wounded\r\nheart--shadow and silence_; so I had written in my letter; and I meant\r\nto fulfil the vow which I had made to myself.\r\n\r\n“So I have entered into the paths of silence and submission. The _fuge,\r\nlate, tace_ of the Carthusian brother is my motto here, my death to the\r\nworld is the life of this canton, my prayer takes the form of the active\r\nwork to which I have set my hand, and which I love--the work of sowing\r\nthe seeds of happiness and joy, of giving to others what I myself have\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n“I have grown so used to this life, completely out of the world and\r\namong the peasants, that I am thoroughly transformed. Even my face is\r\naltered; it has been so continually exposed to the sun, that it has\r\ngrown wrinkled and weather-beaten. I have fallen into the habits of the\r\npeasants; I have assumed their dress, their ways of talking, their gait,\r\ntheir easy-going negligence, their utter indifference to appearances. My\r\nold acquaintances in Paris, or the she-coxcombs on whom I used to\r\ndance attendance, would be puzzled to recognize in me the man who had a\r\ncertain vogue in his day, the sybarite accustomed to all the splendor,\r\nluxury, and finery of Paris. I have come to be absolutely indifferent\r\nto my surroundings, like all those who are possessed by one thought, and\r\nhave only one object in view; for I have but one aim in life--to take\r\nleave of it as soon as possible. I do not want to hasten my end in any\r\nway; but some day, when illness comes, I shall lie down to die without\r\nregret.\r\n\r\n“There, sir, you have the whole story of my life until I came here--told\r\nin all sincerity. I have not attempted to conceal any of my errors;\r\nthey have been great, though others have erred as I have erred. I have\r\nsuffered greatly, and I am suffering still, but I look beyond this life\r\nto a happy future which can only be reached through sorrow. And yet--for\r\nall my resignation, there are moments when my courage fails me. This\r\nvery day I was almost overcome in your presence by inward anguish; you\r\ndid not notice it but----”\r\n\r\nGenestas started in his chair.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Captain Bluteau, you were with me at the time. Do you remember\r\nhow, while we were putting little Jacques to bed, you pointed to the\r\nmattress on which Mother Colas sleeps? Well, you can imagine how painful\r\nit all was; I can never see any child without thinking of the dear child\r\nI have lost, and this little one was doomed to die! I can never see a\r\nchild with indifferent eyes----”\r\n\r\nGenestas turned pale.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the sight of the little golden heads, the innocent beauty of\r\nchildren’s faces always awakens memories of my sorrows, and the old\r\nanguish returns afresh. Now and then, too, there comes the intolerable\r\nthought that so many people here should thank me for what little I can\r\ndo for them, when all that I have done has been prompted by remorse. You\r\nalone, captain, know the secret of my life. If I had drawn my will to\r\nserve them from some purer source than the memory of my errors, I should\r\nbe happy indeed! But then, too, there would have been nothing to tell\r\nyou, and no story about myself.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. ELEGIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Benassis finished his story, he was struck by the troubled expression\r\nof the officer’s face. It touched him to have been so well understood.\r\nHe was almost ready to reproach himself for having distressed his\r\nvisitor. He spoke:\r\n\r\n“But these troubles of mine, Captain Bluteau----”\r\n\r\n“Do not call me Captain Bluteau,” cried Genestas, breaking in upon\r\nthe doctor, and springing to his feet with sudden energy, a change of\r\nposition that seemed to be prompted by inward dissatisfaction of some\r\nkind. “There is no such person as Captain Bluteau.... I am a scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nWith no little astonishment, Benassis beheld Genestas pacing to and fro\r\nin the salon, like a bumble-bee in quest of an exit from the room which\r\nhe has incautiously entered.\r\n\r\n“Then who are you, sir?” inquired Benassis.\r\n\r\n“Ah! there now!” the officer answered, as he turned and took his stand\r\nbefore the doctor, though he lacked courage to look at his friend. “I\r\nhave deceived you!” he went on (and there was a change in his voice). “I\r\nhave acted a lie for the first time in my life, and I am well punished\r\nfor it; for after this I cannot explain why I came here to play the spy\r\nupon you, confound it! Ever since I have had a glimpse of your soul,\r\nso to speak, I would far sooner have taken a box on the ear whenever I\r\nheard you call me Captain Bluteau! Perhaps you may forgive me for this\r\nsubterfuge, but I shall never forgive myself; I, Pierre Joseph Genestas,\r\nwho would not lie to save my life before a court-martial!”\r\n\r\n“Are you Commandant Genestas?” cried Benassis, rising to his feet. He\r\ngrasped the officer’s hand warmly, and added: “As you said but a short\r\ntime ago, sir, we were friends before we knew each other. I have been\r\nvery anxious to make your acquaintance, for I have often heard M.\r\nGravier speak of you. He used to call you, ‘one of Plutarch’s men.’”\r\n\r\n“Plutarch? Nothing of the sort!” answered Genestas. “I am not worthy\r\nof you; I could thrash myself. I ought to have told you my secret in a\r\nstraightforward way at the first. Yet, now! It is quite as well that I\r\nwore a mask, and came here myself in search of information concerning\r\nyou, for now I know that I must hold my tongue. If I had set about this\r\nbusiness in the right fashion it would have been painful to you, and God\r\nforbid that I should give you the slightest annoyance.”\r\n\r\n“But I do not understand you, commandant.”\r\n\r\n“Let the matter drop. I am not ill; I have spent a pleasant day, and\r\nI will go back to-morrow. Whenever you come to Grenoble, you will find\r\nthat you have one more friend there, who will be your friend through\r\nthick and thin. Pierre Joseph Genestas’ sword and purse are at your\r\ndisposal, and I am yours to the last drop of my blood. Well, after all,\r\nyour words have fallen on good soil. When I am pensioned off, I will\r\nlook for some out-of-the-way little place, and be mayor of it, and try\r\nto follow your example. I have not your knowledge, but I will study at\r\nany rate.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir; the landowner who spends his time in convincing\r\na commune of the folly of some mistaken notion of agriculture, confers\r\nupon his country a benefit quite as great as any that the most skilful\r\nphysician can bestow. The latter lessens the sufferings of some few\r\nindividuals, and the former heals the wounds of his country. But you\r\nhave excited my curiosity to no common degree. Is there really something\r\nin which I can be of use to you?”\r\n\r\n“Of use?” repeated the commandant in an altered voice.\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_ I was about to ask you to do me a service which is all but\r\nimpossible, M. Benassis. Just listen a moment! I have killed a good many\r\nChristians in my time, it is true; but you may kill people and keep a\r\ngood heart for all that; so there are some things that I can feel and\r\nunderstand, rough as I look.”\r\n\r\n“But go on!”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not want to give you any pain if I can help it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! commandant, I can bear a great deal.”\r\n\r\n“It is a question of a child’s life, sir,” said the officer, nervously.\r\n\r\nBenassis suddenly knitted his brows, but by a gesture he entreated\r\nGenestas to continue.\r\n\r\n“A child,” repeated the commandant, “whose life may yet be saved by\r\nconstant watchfulness and incessant care. Where could I expect to find\r\na doctor capable of devoting himself to a single patient? Not in a town,\r\nthat much was certain. I had heard you spoken of as an excellent man,\r\nbut I wished to be quite sure that this reputation was well founded. So\r\nbefore putting my little charge into the hands of this M. Benassis of\r\nwhom people spoke so highly, I wanted to study him myself. But now----”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said the doctor; “so this child is yours?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, M. Benassis. To clear up the mystery, I should have to tell you\r\na long story, in which I do not exactly play the part of a hero; but you\r\nhave given me your confidence and I can readily give you mine.”\r\n\r\n“One moment, commandant,” said the doctor. In answer to his summons,\r\nJacquotte appeared at once, and her master ordered tea. “You see,\r\ncommandant, at night when every one is sleeping, I do not sleep.... The\r\nthought of my troubles lies heavily on me, and then I try to forget\r\nthem by taking tea. It produces a sort of nervous inebriation--a kind\r\nof slumber, without which I could not live. Do you still decline to take\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“For my own part,” said Genestas, “I prefer your Hermitage.”\r\n\r\n“By all means. Jacquotte,” said Benassis, turning to his housekeeper,\r\n“bring in some wine and biscuits. We will both of us have our night-cap\r\nafter our separate fashions.”\r\n\r\n“That tea must be very bad for you!” Genestas remarked.\r\n\r\n“It brings on horrid attacks of gout, but I cannot break myself of the\r\nhabit, it is too soothing; it procures for me a brief respite every\r\nnight, a few moments during which life becomes less of a burden....\r\nCome. I am listening; perhaps your story will efface the painful\r\nimpressions left by the memories that I have just recalled.”\r\n\r\nGenestas set down his empty glass upon the chimney-piece. “After the\r\nRetreat from Moscow,” he said, “my regiment was stationed to recruit for\r\na while in a little town in Poland. We were quartered there, in fact,\r\ntill the Emperor returned, and we bought up horses at long prices. So\r\nfar so good. I ought to say that I had a friend in those days. More\r\nthan once during the Retreat I had owed my life to him. He was a\r\nquartermaster, Renard by name; we could not but be like brothers\r\n(military discipline apart) after what he had done for me. They billeted\r\nus on the same house, a sort of shanty, a rat-hole of a place where a\r\nwhole family lived, though you would not have thought there was room to\r\nstable a horse. This particular hovel belonged to some Jews who carried\r\non their six-and-thirty trades in it. The frost had not so stiffened the\r\nold father Jew’s fingers but that he could count gold fast enough; he\r\nhad thriven uncommonly during our reverses. That sort of gentry lives in\r\nsqualor and dies in gold.\r\n\r\n“There were cellars underneath (lined with wood of course, the whole\r\nhouse was built of wood); they had stowed their children away down\r\nthere, and one more particularly, a girl of seventeen, as handsome as a\r\nJewess can be when she keeps herself tidy and has not fair hair. She was\r\nas white as snow, she had eyes like velvet, and dark lashes to them like\r\nrats’ tails; her hair was so thick and glossy that it made you long\r\nto stroke it. She was perfection, and nothing less! I was the first to\r\ndiscover this curious arrangement. I was walking up and down outside\r\none evening, smoking my pipe, after they thought I had gone to bed. The\r\nchildren came in helter-skelter, tumbling over one another like so\r\nmany puppies. It was fun to watch them. Then they had supper with their\r\nfather and mother. I strained my eyes to see the young Jewess through\r\nthe clouds of smoke that her father blew from his pipe; she looked like\r\na new gold piece among a lot of copper coins.\r\n\r\n“I had never reflected about love, my dear Benassis, I had never had\r\ntime; but now at the sight of this young girl I lost my heart and head\r\nand everything else at once, and then it was plain to me that I had\r\nnever been in love before. I was hard hit, and over head and ears in\r\nlove. There I stayed smoking my pipe, absorbed in watching the Jewess\r\nuntil she blew out the candle and went to bed. I could not close my\r\neyes. The whole night long I walked up and down the street smoking my\r\npipe and refilling it from time to time. I had never felt like that\r\nbefore, and for the first and last time in my life I thought of\r\nmarrying.\r\n\r\n“At daybreak I saddled my horse and rode out into the country, to\r\nclear my head. I kept him at a trot for two mortal hours, and all but\r\nfoundered the animal before I noticed it----”\r\n\r\nGenestas stopped short, looked at his new friend uneasily, and said,\r\n“You must excuse me, Benassis, I am no orator; things come out just\r\nas they turn up in my mind. In a room full of fine folk I should feel\r\nawkward, but here in the country with you----”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the doctor.\r\n\r\n“When I came back to my room I found Renard finely flustered. He thought\r\nI had fallen in a duel. He was cleaning his pistols, his head full of\r\nschemes for fastening a quarrel on any one who should have turned me\r\noff into the dark.... Oh! that was just the fellow’s way! I confided my\r\nstory to Renard, showed him the kennel where the children were; and, as\r\nmy comrade understood the jargon that those heathens talked, I begged\r\nhim to help me to lay my proposals before her father and mother, and to\r\ntry to arrange some kind of communication between me and Judith. Judith\r\nthey called her. In short, sir, for a fortnight the Jew and his wife\r\nso arranged matters that we supped every night with Judith, and for a\r\nfortnight I was the happiest of men. You understand and you know how it\r\nwas, so I shall not wear out your patience; still, if you do not smoke,\r\nyou cannot imagine how pleasant it was to smoke a pipe at one’s ease\r\nwith Renard and the girl’s father and one’s princess there before one’s\r\neyes. Oh! yes, it was very pleasant!\r\n\r\n“But I ought to tell you that Renard was a Parisian, and dependent on\r\nhis father, a wholesale grocer, who had educated his son with a view to\r\nmaking a notary of him; so Renard had come by a certain amount of book\r\nlearning before he had been drawn by the conscription and had to bid his\r\ndesk good-bye. Add to this that he was the kind of man who looks well\r\nin a uniform, with a face like a girl’s, and a thorough knowledge of the\r\nart of wheedling people. It was HE whom Judith loved; she cared about\r\nas much for me as a horse cares for roast fowls. Whilst I was in the\r\nseventh heaven, soaring above the clouds at the bare sight of Judith, my\r\nfriend Renard (who, as you see, fairly deserved his name) arrived at an\r\nunderstanding with the girl, and to such good purpose, that they were\r\nmarried forthwith after the custom of her country, without waiting for\r\npermission, which would have been too long in coming. He promised her,\r\nhowever, that if it should happen that the validity of this marriage was\r\nafterwards called in question, they were to be married again according\r\nto French law. As a matter of fact, as soon as she reached France, Mme.\r\nRenard became Mlle. Judith once more.\r\n\r\n“If I had known all this, I would have killed Renard then and there,\r\nwithout giving him time to draw another breath; but the father, the\r\nmother, the girl herself, and the quartermaster were all in the plot\r\nlike thieves in a fair. While I was smoking my pipe, and worshiping\r\nJudith as if she had been one of the saints above, the worthy Renard was\r\narranging to meet her, and managing this piece of business very cleverly\r\nunder my very eyes.\r\n\r\n“You are the only person to whom I have told this story. A disgraceful\r\nthing, I call it. I have always asked myself how it is that a man who\r\nwould die of shame if he took a gold coin that did not belong to him,\r\ndoes not scruple to rob a friend of happiness and life and the woman he\r\nloves. My birds, in fact, were married and happy; and there was I, every\r\nevening at supper, moonstruck, gazing at Judith, responding like some\r\nfellow in a farce to the looks she threw to me in order to throw dust in\r\nmy eyes. They have paid uncommonly dear for all this deceit, as you will\r\ncertainly think. On my conscience, God pays more attention to what goes\r\non in this world than some of us imagine.\r\n\r\n“Down come the Russians upon us, the country is overrun, and the\r\ncampaign of 1813 begins in earnest. One fine morning comes an order;\r\nwe are to be on the battlefield of Lutzen by a stated hour. The Emperor\r\nknew quite well what he was about when he ordered us to start at once.\r\nThe Russians had turned our flank. Our colonel must needs get himself\r\ninto a scrape, by choosing that moment to take leave of a Polish lady\r\nwho lived outside the town, a quarter of a mile away; the Cossack\r\nadvanced guard just caught him nicely, him and his picket. There was\r\nscarcely time to spring into our saddles and draw up before the town so\r\nas to engage in a cavalry skirmish. We must check the Russian advance if\r\nwe meant to draw off during the night. Again and again we charged, and\r\nfor three hours did wonders. Under cover of the fighting the baggage\r\nand artillery set out. We had a park of artillery and great stores of\r\npowder, of which the Emperor stood in desperate need; they must reach\r\nhim at all costs.\r\n\r\n“Our resistance deceived the Russians, who thought at first that we\r\nwere supported by an army corps; but before very long they learned their\r\nerror from their scouts, and knew that they had only a single regiment\r\nof cavalry to deal with and the invalided foot soldiers in the depot.\r\nOn finding it out, sir, they made a murderous onslaught on us towards\r\nevening; the action was so hot that a good few of us were left on the\r\nfield. We were completely surrounded. I was by Renard’s side in the\r\nfront rank, and I saw how my friend fought and charged like a demon; he\r\nwas thinking of his wife. Thanks to him, we managed to regain the town,\r\nwhich our invalids had put more or less in a state of defence, but it\r\nwas pitiful to see it. We were the last to return--he and I. A body of\r\nCossacks appeared in our way, and on this we rode in hot haste. One\r\nof the savages was about to run me through with a lance, when Renard,\r\ncatching a sight of his manoeuvre, thrust his horse between us to\r\nturn aside the blow; his poor brute--a fine animal it was, upon my\r\nword--received the lance thrust and fell, bringing down both Renard and\r\nthe Cossack with him. I killed the Cossack, seized Renard by the arm,\r\nand laid him crosswise before me on my horse like a sack of wheat.\r\n\r\n“‘Good-bye, captain,’ Renard said; ‘it is all over with me.’\r\n\r\n“‘Not yet,’ I answered; ‘I must have a look at you.’ We had reached the\r\ntown by that time; I dismounted, and propped him up on a little straw\r\nby the corner of the house. A wound in the head had laid open the brain,\r\nand yet he spoke!... Oh! he was a brave man.\r\n\r\n“‘We are quits,’ he said. ‘I have given you my life, and I had taken\r\nJudith from you. Take care of her and of her child, if she has one. And\r\nnot only so--you must marry her.’\r\n\r\n“I left him then and there sir, like a dog; when the first fury of anger\r\nleft me, and I went back again--he was dead. The Cossacks had set fire\r\nto the town, and the thought of Judith then came to my mind. I went in\r\nsearch of her, took her up behind me in the saddle, and, thanks to my\r\nswift horse, caught up the regiment which was effecting its retreat. As\r\nfor the Jew and his family, there was not one of them left, they had all\r\ndisappeared like rats; there was no one but Judith in the house, waiting\r\nalone there for Renard. At first, as you can understand, I told her not\r\na word of all that had happened.\r\n\r\n“So it befell that all through the disastrous campaign of 1813 I had a\r\nwoman to look after, to find quarters for her, and to see that she was\r\ncomfortable. She scarcely knew, I think, the straits to which we were\r\nreduced. I was always careful to keep her ten leagues ahead of us as\r\nwe drew back towards France. Her boy was born while we were fighting\r\nat Hanau. I was wounded in the engagement, and only rejoined Judith at\r\nStrasburg; then I returned to Paris, for, unluckily, I was laid up all\r\nthrough the campaign in France. If it had not been for that wretched\r\nmishap, I should have entered the Grenadier Guards, and then the Emperor\r\nwould have promoted me. As it was, sir, I had three broken ribs and\r\nanother man’s wife and child to support! My pay, as you can imagine, was\r\nnot exactly the wealth of the Indies. Renard’s father, the toothless\r\nold shark, would have nothing to say to his daughter-in-law; and the old\r\nfather Jew had made off. Judith was fretting herself to death. She cried\r\none morning while she was dressing my wound.\r\n\r\n“‘Judith,’ said I, ‘your child has nothing in this world----’\r\n\r\n“‘Neither have I!’ she said.\r\n\r\n“‘Pshaw!’ I answered, ‘we will send for all the necessary papers, I will\r\nmarry you; and as for the child, I will look on him as mine----’ I could\r\nnot say any more.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear sir, what would not one do for the look by which Judith\r\nthanked me--a look of thanks from dying eyes; I saw clearly that I had\r\nloved, and should love her always, and from that day her child found\r\na place in my heart. She died, poor woman, while the father and mother\r\nJews and the papers were on the way. The day before she died, she found\r\nstrength enough to rise and dress herself for her wedding, to go through\r\nall the usual performance, and set her name to their pack of papers;\r\nthen, when her child had a name and a father, she went back to her bed\r\nagain; I kissed her hands and her forehead, and she died.\r\n\r\n“That was my wedding. Two days later, when I had bought the few feet of\r\nearth in which the poor girl is laid, I found myself the father of an\r\norphan child. I put him out to nurse during the campaign of 1815. Ever\r\nsince that time, without letting any one know my story, which did not\r\nsound very well, I have looked after the little rogue as if he were my\r\nown child. I don’t know what became of his grandfather; he is wandering\r\nabout, a ruined man, somewhere or other between Russia and Persia.\r\nThe chances are that he may make a fortune some day, for he seemed to\r\nunderstand the trade in precious stones.\r\n\r\n“I sent the child to school. I wanted him to take a good place at the\r\nEcole Polytechnique and to see him graduate there with credit, so of\r\nlate I have had him drilled in mathematics to such good purpose that the\r\npoor little soul has been knocked up by it. He has a delicate chest. By\r\nall I can make out from the doctors in Paris, there would be some hope\r\nfor him still if he were allowed to run wild among the hills, if he\r\nwas properly cared for, and constantly looked after by somebody who was\r\nwilling to undertake the task. So I thought of you, and I came here to\r\ntake stock of your ideas and your ways of life. After what you have told\r\nme, I could not possibly cause you pain in this way, for we are good\r\nfriends already.”\r\n\r\n“Commandant,” said Benassis after a moment’s pause, “bring Judith’s\r\nchild here to me. It is doubtless God’s will to submit me to this final\r\ntrial, and I will endure it. I will offer up these sufferings to God,\r\nwhose Son died upon the cross. Besides, your story has awakened tender\r\nfeelings; does not that auger well for me?”\r\n\r\nGenestas took both of Benassis’ hands and pressed them warmly, unable\r\nto check the tears that filled his eyes and coursed down his sunburned\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Let us keep silence with regard to all this,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, commandant. You are not drinking?”\r\n\r\n“I am not thirsty,” Genestas answered. “I am a perfect fool!”\r\n\r\n“Well, when will you bring him to me?”\r\n\r\n“Why, to-morrow, if you will let me. He has been at Grenoble these two\r\ndays.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Set out to-morrow morning and come back again. I shall wait for\r\nyou in La Fosseuse’s cottage, and we will all four of us breakfast there\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” said Genestas, and the two friends as they went upstairs bade\r\neach other good-night. When they reached the landing that lay between\r\ntheir rooms, Genestas set down his candle on the window ledge and turned\r\ntowards Benassis.\r\n\r\n“_Tonnerre de Dieu!_” he said, with outspoken enthusiasm; “I cannot let\r\nyou go without telling you that you are the third among christened men\r\nto make me understand that there is Something up there,” and he pointed\r\nto the sky.\r\n\r\nThe doctor’s answer was a smile full of sadness and a cordial grasp of\r\nthe hand that Genestas held out to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak next morning Commandant Genestas was on his way. On his\r\nreturn, it was noon before he reached the spot on the highroad between\r\nGrenoble and the little town, where the pathway turned that led to La\r\nFosseuse’s cottage. He was seated in one of the light open cars with\r\nfour wheels, drawn by one horse, that are in use everywhere on the\r\nroads in these hilly districts. Genestas’ companion was a thin,\r\ndelicate-looking lad, apparently about twelve years of age, though in\r\nreality he was in his sixteenth year. Before alighting, the officer\r\nlooked round about him in several directions in search of a peasant who\r\nwould take the carriage back to Benassis’ house. It was impossible\r\nto drive to La Fosseuse’s cottage, the pathway was too narrow. The\r\npark-keeper happened to appear upon the scene, and helped Genestas\r\nout of his difficulty, so that the officer and his adopted son were at\r\nliberty to follow the mountain footpath that led to the trysting-place.\r\n\r\n“Would you not enjoy spending a year in running about in this lovely\r\ncountry, Adrien? Learning to hunt and to ride a horse, instead of\r\ngrowing pale over your books? Stay! look there!”\r\n\r\nAdrien obediently glanced over the valley with languid indifference;\r\nlike all lads of his age, he cared nothing for the beauty of natural\r\nscenery; so he only said, “You are very kind, father,” without checking\r\nhis walk.\r\n\r\nThe invalid listlessness of this answer went to Genestas’ heart; he said\r\nno more to his son, and they reached La Fosseuse’s house in silence.\r\n\r\n“You are punctual, commandant!” cried Benassis, rising from the wooden\r\nbench where he was sitting.\r\n\r\nBut at the sight of Adrien he sat down again, and seemed for a while to\r\nbe lost in thought. In a leisurely fashion he scanned the lad’s sallow,\r\nweary face, not without admiring its delicate oval outlines, one of the\r\nmost noticeable characteristics of a noble head. The lad was the living\r\nimage of his mother. He had her olive complexion, beautiful black eyes\r\nwith a sad and thoughtful expression in them, long hair, a head too\r\nenergetic for the fragile body; all the peculiar beauty of the Polish\r\nJewess had been transmitted to her son.\r\n\r\n“Do you sleep soundly, my little man?” Benassis asked him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see your knees; turn back your trousers.”\r\n\r\nAdrien reddened, unfastened his garters, and showed his knee to the\r\ndoctor, who felt it carefully over.\r\n\r\n“Good. Now speak; shout, shout as loud as you can.” Adrien obeyed.\r\n\r\n“That will do. Now give me your hands.”\r\n\r\nThe lad held them out; white, soft, and blue-veined hands, like those of\r\na woman.\r\n\r\n“Where were you at school in Paris?”\r\n\r\n“At Saint Louis.”\r\n\r\n“Did your master read his breviary during the night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“So you did not go straight off to sleep?”\r\n\r\nAs Adrien made no answer to this, Genestas spoke. “The master is a\r\nworthy priest; he advised me to take my little rascal away on the score\r\nof his health,” he told the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Well,” answered Benassis, with a clear, penetrating gaze into Adrien’s\r\nfrightened eyes, “there is a good chance. Oh, we shall make a man of him\r\nyet. We will live together like a pair of comrades, my boy! We will\r\nkeep early hours. I mean to show this boy of yours how to ride a horse,\r\ncommandant. He shall be put on a milk diet for a month or two, so as to\r\nget his digestion into order again, and then I will take out a shooting\r\nlicense for him, and put him in Butifer’s hands, and the two of them\r\nshall have some chamois-hunting. Give your son four or five months\r\nof out-door life, and you will not know him again, commandant! How\r\ndelighted Butifer will be! I know the fellow; he will take you over into\r\nSwitzerland, my young friend; haul you over the Alpine passes and up the\r\nmountain peaks, and add six inches to your height in six months; he\r\nwill put some color into your cheeks and brace your nerves, and make you\r\nforget all these bad ways that you have fallen into at school. And after\r\nthat you can go back to your work; and you will be a man some of these\r\ndays. Butifer is an honest young fellow. We can trust him with the\r\nmoney necessary for traveling expenses and your hunting expeditions. The\r\nresponsibility will keep him steady for six months, and that will be a\r\nvery good thing for him.”\r\n\r\nGenestas’ face brightened more and more at every word the doctor spoke.\r\n\r\n“Now, let us go in to breakfast. La Fosseuse is very anxious to see\r\nyou,” said Benassis, giving Adrien a gentle tap on the cheek.\r\n\r\nGenestas took the doctor’s arm and drew him a little aside. “Then he is\r\nnot consumptive after all?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No more than you or I.”\r\n\r\n“Then what is the matter with him?”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” answered Benassis; “he is a little run down, that is all.”\r\n\r\nLa Fosseuse appeared on the threshold of the door, and Genestas noticed,\r\nnot without surprise, her simple but coquettish costume. This was not\r\nthe peasant girl of yesterday evening, but a graceful and well-dressed\r\nParisian woman, against whose glances he felt that he was not proof.\r\nThe soldier turned his eyes on the table, which was made of walnut wood.\r\nThere was no tablecloth, but the surface might have been varnished,\r\nit was so well rubbed and polished. Eggs, butter, a rice pudding, and\r\nfragrant wild strawberries had been set out, and the poor child had put\r\nflowers everywhere about the room; evidently it was a great day for\r\nher. At the sight of all this, the commandant could not help looking\r\nenviously at the little house and the green sward about it, and watched\r\nthe peasant girl with an air that expressed both his doubts and\r\nhis hopes. Then his eyes fell on Adrien, with whom La Fosseuse was\r\ndeliberately busying herself, and handing him the eggs.\r\n\r\n“Now, commandant,” said Benassis, “you know the terms on which you are\r\nreceiving hospitality. You must tell La Fosseuse ‘something about the\r\narmy.’”\r\n\r\n“But let the gentleman first have his breakfast in peace, and then,\r\nafter he has taken a cup of coffee----”\r\n\r\n“By all means, I shall be very glad,” answered the commandant; “but it\r\nmust be upon one condition: you will tell us the story of some adventure\r\nin your past life, will you not, mademoiselle?”\r\n\r\n“Why, nothing worth telling has ever happened to me, sir,” she answered,\r\nas her color rose. “Will you take a little more rice pudding?” she\r\nadded, as she saw that Adrien’s plate was empty.\r\n\r\n“If you please, mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“The pudding is delicious,” said Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Then what will you say to her coffee and cream?” cried Benassis.\r\n\r\n“I would rather hear our pretty hostess talk.”\r\n\r\n“You did not put that nicely, Genestas,” said Benassis. He took La\r\nFosseuse’s hand in his and pressed it as he went on: “Listen, my child;\r\nthere is a kind heart hidden away beneath that officer’s stern exterior,\r\nand you can talk freely before him. We do not want to press you to talk,\r\ndo not tell us anything unless you like: but if ever you can be listened\r\nto and understood, poor little one, it will be by the three who are with\r\nyou now at this moment. Tell us all about your love affairs in the\r\nold days, that will not admit us into any of the real secrets of your\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\n“Here is Mariette with the coffee,” she answered, “and as soon as you\r\nare all served, I will tell about my ‘love affairs’ very willingly. But\r\nM. le Commandant will not forget his promise?” she added, challenging\r\nthe officer with a shy glance.\r\n\r\n“That would be impossible, mademoiselle,” Genestas answered\r\nrespectfully.\r\n\r\n“When I was sixteen years old,” La Fosseuse began, “I had to beg my\r\nbread on the roadside in Savoy, though my health was very bad. I used to\r\nsleep at Echelles, in a manger full of straw. The innkeeper who gave me\r\nshelter was kind, but his wife could not abide me, and was always saying\r\nhard things. I used to feel very miserable; for though I was a beggar,\r\nI was not a naughty child; I used to say my prayers every night and\r\nmorning, I never stole anything, and I did as Heaven bade me in begging\r\nfor my living, for there was nothing that I could turn my hands to, and\r\nI was really unfit for work--quite unable to handle a hoe or to wind\r\nspools of cotton.\r\n\r\n“Well, they drove me away from the inn at last; a dog was the cause of\r\nit all. I had neither father nor mother nor friends. I had met with no\r\none, ever since I was born, whose eyes had any kindness in them for me.\r\nMorin, the old woman who had brought me up, was dead. She had been very\r\ngood to me, but I cannot remember that she ever petted me much; besides,\r\nshe worked out in the fields like a man, poor thing; and if she fondled\r\nme at times, she also used to rap my fingers with the spoon if I ate the\r\nsoup too fast out of the porringer we had between us. Poor old woman,\r\nnever a day passes but I remember her in my prayers! If it might please\r\nGod to let her live a happier life up there than she did here below!\r\nAnd, above all things, if she might only lie a little softer there, for\r\nshe was always grumbling about the pallet-bed that we both used to\r\nsleep upon. You could not possibly imagine how it hurts one’s soul to be\r\nrepulsed by every one, to receive nothing but hard words and looks that\r\ncut you to the heart, just as if they were so many stabs of a knife. I\r\nhave known poor old people who were so used to these things that they\r\ndid not mind them a bit, but I was not born for that sort of life. A\r\n‘No’ always made me cry. Every evening I came back again more unhappy\r\nthan ever, and only felt comforted when I had said my prayers. In all\r\nGod’s world, in fact, there was not a soul to care for me, no one to\r\nwhom I could pour out my heart. My only friend was the blue sky. I have\r\nalways been happy when there was a cloudless sky above my head. I used\r\nto lie and watch the weather from some nook among the crags when the\r\nwind had swept the clouds away. At such times I used to dream that I was\r\na great lady. I used to gaze into the sky till I felt myself bathed in\r\nthe blue; I lived up there in thought, rising higher and higher yet,\r\ntill my troubles weighed on me no more, and there was nothing but\r\ngladness left.\r\n\r\n“But to return to my ‘love affairs.’ I must tell you that the\r\ninnkeeper’s spaniel had a dear little puppy, just as sensible as a human\r\nbeing; he was quite white, with black spots on his paws, a cherub of a\r\npuppy! I can see him yet. Poor little fellow, he was the only creature\r\nwho ever gave me a friendly look in those days; I kept all my tidbits\r\nfor him. He knew me, and came to look for me every evening. How he used\r\nto spring up at me! And he would bite my feet, he was not ashamed of my\r\npoverty; there was something so grateful and so kind in his eyes that it\r\nbrought tears into mine to see it. ‘That is the one living creature that\r\nreally cares for me!’ I used to say. He slept at my feet that winter.\r\nIt hurt me so much to see him beaten, that I broke him of the habit of\r\ngoing into houses, to steal bones, and he was quite contented with my\r\ncrusts. When I was unhappy, he used to come and stand in front of me,\r\nand look into my eyes; it was just as if he said, ‘So you are sad, my\r\npoor Fosseuse?’\r\n\r\n“If a traveler threw me some halfpence, he would pick them up out of the\r\ndust and bring them to me, clever little spaniel that he was! I was\r\nless miserable so long as I had that friend. Every day I put away a few\r\nhalfpence, for I wanted to get fifteen francs together, so that I might\r\nbuy him of Pere Manseau. One day his wife saw that the dog was fond of\r\nme, so she herself took a sudden violent fancy to him. The dog, mind\r\nyou, could not bear her. Oh, animals know people by instinct! If you\r\nreally care for them, they find it out in a moment. I had a gold coin,\r\na twenty-franc piece, sewed into the band of my skirt; so I spoke to M.\r\nManseau: ‘Dear sir, I meant to offer you my year’s savings for your dog;\r\nbut now your wife has a mind to keep him, although she cares very little\r\nabout him, and rather than that, will you sell him to me for twenty\r\nfrancs? Look, I have the money here.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, no, little woman,’ he said; ‘put up your twenty francs. Heaven\r\nforbid that I should take their money from the poor! Keep the dog; and\r\nif my wife makes a fuss about it, you must go away.’\r\n\r\n“His wife made a terrible to-do about the dog. Ah! _mon Dieu_! any one\r\nmight have thought the house was on fire! You never would guess the\r\nnotion that next came into her head. She saw that the little fellow\r\nlooked on me as his mistress, and that she could only have him against\r\nhis will, so she had him poisoned; and my poor spaniel died in my\r\narms.... I cried over him as if he had been my child, and buried him\r\nunder a pine-tree. You do not know all that I laid in that grave. As I\r\nsat there beside it, I told myself that henceforward I should always be\r\nalone in the world; that I had nothing left to hope for; that I should\r\nbe again as I had been before, a poor lonely girl; that I should never\r\nmore see a friendly light in any eyes. I stayed out there all through\r\nthe night, praying God to have pity on me. When I went back to the\r\nhighroad I saw a poor little child, about ten years old, who had no\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“‘God has heard me,’ I thought. I had prayed that night as I had never\r\nprayed before. ‘I will take care of the poor little one; we will beg\r\ntogether, and I will be a mother to him. Two of us ought to do better\r\nthan one; perhaps I should have more courage for him than I have for\r\nmyself.’\r\n\r\n“At first the little boy seemed to be quite happy, and, indeed, he would\r\nhave been hard to please if he had not been content. I did everything\r\nthat he wanted, and gave him the best of all that I had; I was his slave\r\nin fact, and he tyrannized over me, but that was nicer than being alone,\r\nI used to think! Pshaw! no sooner did the little good-for-nothing know\r\nthat I carried a twenty-franc piece sewed into my skirtband than he cut\r\nthe stitches, and stole my gold coin, the price of my poor spaniel! I\r\nhad meant to have masses said with it.... A child without hands, too!\r\nOh, it makes one shudder! Somehow that theft took all the heart out of\r\nme. It seemed as if I was to love nothing but it should come to some\r\nwretched end.\r\n\r\n“One day at Echelles, I watched a fine carriage coming slowly up the\r\nhillside. There was a young lady, as beautiful as the Virgin Mary, in\r\nthe carriage, and a young man, who looked like the young lady. ‘Just\r\nlook,’ he said; ‘there is a pretty girl!’ and he flung a silver coin to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“No one but you, M. Benassis, could understand how pleased I was\r\nwith the compliment, the first that I had ever had: but, indeed, the\r\ngentleman ought not to have thrown the money to me. I was in a flutter;\r\nI knew of a short cut, a footpath among the rocks, and started at once\r\nto run, so that I reached the summit of the Echelles long before the\r\ncarriage, which was coming up very slowly. I saw the young man again;\r\nhe was quite surprised to find me there; and as for me, I was so pleased\r\nthat my heart seemed to be throbbing in my throat. Some kind of instinct\r\ndrew me towards him. After he had recognized me, I went on my way again;\r\nI felt quite sure that he and the young lady with him would leave\r\nthe carriage to see the waterfall at Couz, and so they did. When they\r\nalighted, they saw me once more, under the walnut-trees by the wayside.\r\nThey asked me many questions, and seemed to take an interest in what I\r\ntold them about myself. In all my life I had never heard such pleasant\r\nvoices as they had, that handsome young man and his sister, for she was\r\nhis sister, I am sure. I thought about them for a whole year afterwards,\r\nand kept on hoping that they would come back. I would have given two\r\nyears of my life only to see that traveler again, he looked so nice.\r\nUntil I knew M. Benassis these were the greatest events of my life.\r\nAlthough my mistress turned me away for trying on that horrid ball-dress\r\nof hers, I was sorry for her, and I have forgiven her, for candidly, if\r\nyou will give me leave to say so, I thought myself the better woman of\r\nthe two, countess though she was.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Genestas, after a moment’s pause, “you see that Providence\r\nhas kept a friendly eye on you, you are in clover here.”\r\n\r\nAt these words La Fosseuse looked at Benassis with eyes full of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n“Would that I was rich!” came from Genestas. The officer’s exclamation\r\nwas followed by profound silence.\r\n\r\n“You owe me a story,” said La Fosseuse at last, in coaxing tones.\r\n\r\n“I will tell it at once,” answered Genestas. “On the evening before the\r\nbattle of Friedland,” he went on, after a moment, “I had been sent with\r\na despatch to General Davoust’s quarters, and I was on the way back to\r\nmy own, when at a turn in the road I found myself face to face with the\r\nEmperor. Napoleon gave me a look.\r\n\r\n“‘You are Captain Genestas, are you not?’ he said.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, your Majesty.’\r\n\r\n“‘You were out in Egypt?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, your Majesty.’\r\n\r\n“‘You had better not keep to the road you are on,’ he said; ‘turn to the\r\nleft, you will reach your division sooner that way.’\r\n\r\n“That was what the Emperor said, but you would never imagine how kindly\r\nhe said it; and he had so many irons in the fire just then, for he was\r\nriding about surveying the position of the field. I am telling you this\r\nstory to show you what a memory he had, and so that you may know that he\r\nknew my face. I took the oath in 1815. But for that mistake, perhaps I\r\nmight have been a colonel to-day; I never meant to betray the Bourbons,\r\nFrance must be defended, and that was all I thought about. I was a Major\r\nin the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard; and although my wound still\r\ngave me trouble, I swung a sabre in the battle of Waterloo. When it\r\nwas all over, and Napoleon returned to Paris, I went too; then when he\r\nreached Rochefort, I followed him against his orders; it was some sort\r\nof comfort to watch over him and to see that no mishap befell him on the\r\nway. So when he was walking along the beach he turned and saw me on duty\r\nten paces from him.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, Genestas,’ he said, as he came towards me, ‘so we are not yet\r\ndead, either of us?’\r\n\r\n“It cut me to the heart to hear him say that. If you had heard him,\r\nyou would have shuddered from head to foot, as I did. He pointed to the\r\nvillainous English vessel that was keeping the entrance to the Harbor.\r\n‘When I see _that_,’ he said, ‘and think of my Guard, I wish that I had\r\nperished in that torrent of blood.’\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Genestas, looking at the doctor and at La Fosseuse, “those\r\nwere his very words.\r\n\r\n“‘The generals who counseled you not to charge with the Guard, and\r\nwho hurried you into your traveling carriage, were not true friends of\r\nyours,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘Come with me,’ he cried eagerly, ‘the game is not ended yet.’\r\n\r\n“‘I would gladly go with your Majesty, but I am not free; I have a\r\nmotherless child on my hands just now.’\r\n\r\n“And so it happened that Adrien over there prevented me from going to\r\nSt. Helena.\r\n\r\n“‘Stay,’ he said, ‘I have never given you anything. You are not one\r\nof those who fill one hand and then hold out the other. Here is the\r\nsnuff-box that I have used though this last campaign. And stay on in\r\nFrance; after all, brave men are wanted there! Remain in the service,\r\nand keep me in remembrance. Of all my army in Egypt, you are the last\r\nthat I have seen still on his legs in France.’ And he gave me a little\r\nsnuff-box.\r\n\r\n“‘Have “_Honneur et patrie_” engraved on it,’ he said; ‘the history of\r\nour last two campaigns is summed up in those three words.’\r\n\r\n“Then those who were going out with him came up, and I spent the rest\r\nof the morning with them. The Emperor walked to and fro along the beach;\r\nthere was not a sign of agitation about him, though he frowned from\r\ntime to time. At noon, it was considered hopeless for him to attempt to\r\nescape by sea. The English had found out that he was at Rochefort; he\r\nmust either give himself up to them, or cross the breadth of France\r\nagain. We were wretchedly anxious; the minutes seemed like hours! On the\r\none hand there were the Bourbons, who would have shot Napoleon if he had\r\nfallen into their clutches; and on the other, the English, a dishonored\r\nrace: they covered themselves with shame by flinging a foe who asked for\r\nhospitality away on a desert rock, that is a stain which they will never\r\nwash away. Whilst they were anxiously debating, some one or other among\r\nhis suite presented a sailor to him, a Lieutenant Doret, who had a\r\nscheme for reaching America to lay before him. As a matter of fact, a\r\nbrig from the States and a merchant vessel were lying in the harbor.\r\n\r\n“‘But how could you set about it, captain?’ the Emperor asked him.\r\n\r\n“‘You will be on board the merchant vessel, Sire,’ the man answered.\r\n‘I will run up the white flag and man the brig with a few devoted\r\nfollowers. We will tackle the English vessel, set fire to her, and board\r\nher, and you will get clear away.’\r\n\r\n“‘We will go with you!’ I cried to the captain. But Napoleon looked at\r\nus and said, ‘Captain Doret, keep yourself for France.’\r\n\r\n“It was the only time I ever saw Napoleon show any emotion. With a\r\nwave of his hand to us he went in again. I watched him go on board the\r\nEnglish vessel, and then I went away. It was all over with him, and he\r\nknew it. There was a traitor in the harbor, who by means of signals gave\r\nwarning to the Emperor’s enemies of his presence. Then Napoleon fell\r\nback on a last resource; he did as he had been wont to do on the\r\nbattlefield: he went to his foes instead of letting them come to him.\r\nTalk of troubles! No words could ever make you understand the misery of\r\nthose who loved him for his own sake.”\r\n\r\n“But where is his snuff-box?” asked La Fosseuse.\r\n\r\n“It is in a box at Grenoble,” the commandant replied.\r\n\r\n“I will go over to see it, if you will let me. To think that you have\r\nsomething in your possession that his fingers have touched!... Had he a\r\nwell-shaped hand?”\r\n\r\n“Very.”\r\n\r\n“Can it be true that he is dead? Come, tell me the real truth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear child, he is dead; there is no doubt about it.”\r\n\r\n“I was such a little girl in 1815. I was not tall enough to see anything\r\nbut his hat, and even so I was nearly crushed to death in the crowd at\r\nGrenoble.”\r\n\r\n“Your coffee and cream is very nice indeed,” said Genestas. “Well,\r\nAdrien, how do you like this country? Will you come here to see\r\nmademoiselle?”\r\n\r\nThe boy made no answer; he seemed afraid to look at La Fosseuse.\r\nBenassis never took his eyes off Adrien; he appeared to be reading the\r\nlad’s very soul.\r\n\r\n“Of course he will come to see her,” said Benassis. “But let us go home\r\nagain, I have a pretty long round to make, and I shall want a horse.\r\nI daresay you and Jacquotte will manage to get on together whilst I am\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n“Will you not come with us?” said Genestas to La Fosseuse.\r\n\r\n“Willingly,” she answered; “I have a lot of things to take over for Mme.\r\nJacquotte.”\r\n\r\nThey started out for the doctor’s house. Her visitors had raised La\r\nFosseuse’s spirits; she led the way along narrow tracks, through the\r\nloneliest parts of the hills.\r\n\r\n“You have told us nothing about yourself, Monsieur l’Officier,” she\r\nsaid. “I should have liked to hear you tell us about some adventure in\r\nthe wars. I liked what you told us about Napoleon very much, but it made\r\nme feel sad.... If you would be so very kind----”\r\n\r\n“Quite right!” Benassis exclaimed. “You ought to tell us about some\r\nthrilling adventure during our walk. Come, now, something really\r\ninteresting like that business of the beam in Beresina!”\r\n\r\n“So few of my recollections are worth telling,” said Genestas. “Some\r\npeople come in for all kinds of adventures, but I have never managed to\r\nbe the hero of any story. Oh! stop a bit though, a funny thing did once\r\nhappen to me. I was with the Grand Army in 1805, and so, of course, I\r\nwas at Austerlitz. There was a great deal of skirmishing just before Ulm\r\nsurrendered, which kept the cavalry pretty fully occupied. Moreover, we\r\nwere under the command of Murat, who never let the grass grow under his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“I was still only a sub-lieutenant in those days. It was just at the\r\nopening of the campaign, and after one of these affairs, that we took\r\npossession of a district in which there were a good many fine estates;\r\nso it fell out that one evening my regiment bivouacked in a park\r\nbelonging to a handsome chateau where a countess lived, a young and\r\npretty woman she was. Of course, I meant to lodge in the house, and\r\nI hurried there to put a stop to pillage of any sort. I came into the\r\nsalon just as my quartermaster was pointing his carbine at the countess,\r\nhis brutal way of asking for what she certainly could not give the\r\nugly scoundrel. I struck up his carbine with my sword, the bullet\r\nwent through a looking-glass on the wall, then I dealt my gentleman a\r\nback-handed blow that stretched him on the floor. The sound of the shot\r\nand the cries of the countess fetched all her people on the scene, and\r\nit was my turn to be in danger.\r\n\r\n“‘Stop!’ she cried in German (for they were going to run me through the\r\nbody), ‘this officer has saved my life!’\r\n\r\n“They drew back at that. The lady gave me her handkerchief (a fine\r\nembroidered handkerchief, which I have yet), telling me that her house\r\nwould always be open to me, and that I should always find a sister and\r\na devoted friend in her, if at any time I should be in any sort of\r\ntrouble. In short, she did not know how to make enough of me. She was\r\nas fair as a wedding morning and as charming as a kitten. We had dinner\r\ntogether. Next day, I was distractedly in love, but next day I had to be\r\nat my place at Guntzburg, or wherever it was. There was no help for it,\r\nI had to turn out, and started off with my handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Well, we gave them battle, and all the time I kept on saying to myself,\r\n‘I wish a bullet would come my way! _Mon Dieu_! they are flying thick\r\nenough!’\r\n\r\n“I had no wish for a ball in the thigh, for I should have had to stop\r\nwhere I was in that case, and there would have been no going back to the\r\nchateau, but I was not particular; a nice wound in the arm I should have\r\nliked best, so that I might be nursed and made much of by the princess.\r\nI flung myself on the enemy, like mad; but I had no sort of luck, and\r\ncame out of the action quite safe and sound. We must march, and there\r\nwas an end of it; I never saw the countess again, and there is the whole\r\nstory.”\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached Benassis’ house; the doctor mounted\r\nhis horse at once and disappeared. Genestas recommended his son to\r\nJacquotte’s care, so the doctor on his return found that she had taken\r\nAdrien completely under her wing, and had installed him in M. Gravier’s\r\ncelebrated room. With no small astonishment, she heard her master’s\r\norder to put up a simple camp-bed in his own room, for that the lad was\r\nto sleep there, and this in such an authoritative tone, that for once in\r\nher life Jacquotte found not a single word to say.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the commandant went back to Grenoble. Benassis’ reiterated\r\nassurances that the lad would soon be restored to health had taken a\r\nweight off his mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEight months later, in the earliest days of the following December,\r\nGenestas was appointed to be lieutenant-colonel of a regiment stationed\r\nat Poitiers. He was just thinking of writing to Benassis to tell him of\r\nthe journey he was about to take, when a letter came from the doctor.\r\nHis friend told him that Adrien was once more in sound health.\r\n\r\n“The boy has grown strong and tall,” he said; “and he is wonderfully\r\nwell. He has profited by Butifer’s instruction since you saw him last,\r\nand is now as good a shot as our smuggler himself. He has grown brisk\r\nand active too; he is a good walker, and rides well; he is not in the\r\nleast like the lad of sixteen who looked like a boy of twelve eight\r\nmonths ago; any one might think that he was twenty years old. There is\r\nan air of self-reliance and independence about him. In fact he is a man\r\nnow, and you must begin to think about his future at once.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go over to Benassis to-morrow, of course,” said Genestas to\r\nhimself, “and I will see what he says before I make up my mind what to\r\ndo with that fellow,” and with that he went to a farewell dinner given\r\nto him by his brother officers. He would be leaving Grenoble now in a\r\nvery few days.\r\n\r\nAs the lieutenant-colonel returned after the dinner, his servant handed\r\nhim a letter. It had been brought by a messenger, he said, who had\r\nwaited a long while for an answer.\r\n\r\nGenestas recognized Adrien’s handwriting, although his head was swimming\r\nafter the toasts that had been drunk in his honor; probably, he thought,\r\nthe letter merely contained a request to gratify some boyish whim, so\r\nhe left it unopened on the table. The next morning, when the fumes of\r\nchampagne had passed off, he took it up and began to read.\r\n\r\n  “My dear father----”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you young rogue,” was his comment, “you know how to coax whenever\r\nyou want something.”\r\n\r\n  “Our dear M. Benassis is dead----”\r\n\r\nThe letter dropped from Genestas’ hands; it was some time before he\r\ncould read any more.\r\n\r\n  “Every one is in consternation. The trouble is all the greater\r\n  because it came as a sudden shock. It was so unexpected. M.\r\n  Benassis seemed perfectly well the day before; there was not a\r\n  sign of ill-health about him. Only the day before yesterday he\r\n  went to see all his patients, even those who lived farthest away;\r\n  it was as if he had known what was going to happen; and he spoke\r\n  to every one whom he met, saying, ‘Good-bye, my friends,’ each\r\n  time. Towards five o’clock he came back just as usual to have\r\n  dinner with me. He was tired; Jacquotte noticed the purplish flush\r\n  on his face, but the weather was so very cold that she would not\r\n  get ready a warm foot-bath for him, as she usually did when she\r\n  saw that the blood had gone to his head. So she has been wailing,\r\n  poor thing, through her tears for these two days past, ‘If I had\r\n  _only_ given him a foot-bath, he would be living now!’\r\n\r\n  “M Benassis was hungry; he made a good dinner. I thought that he\r\n  was in higher spirits than usual; we both of us laughed a great\r\n  deal, I had never seen him laugh so much before. After dinner,\r\n  towards seven o’clock, a man came with a message from Saint\r\n  Laurent du Pont; it was a serious case, and M. Benassis was\r\n  urgently needed. He said to me, ‘I shall have to go, though I\r\n  never care to set out on horseback when I have hardly digested my\r\n  dinner, more especially when it is as cold as this. It is enough\r\n  to kill a man!’\r\n\r\n  “For all that, he went. At nine o’clock the postman Goguelat,\r\n  brought a letter for M. Benassis. Jacquotte was tired out, for it\r\n  was her washing-day. She gave me the letter and went off to bed.\r\n  She begged me to keep a good fire in our bedroom, and to have some\r\n  tea ready for M. Benassis when he came in, for I am still sleeping\r\n  in the little cot-bed in his room. I raked out the fire in the\r\n  salon, and went upstairs to wait for my good friend. I looked at\r\n  the letter, out of curiosity, before I laid it on the\r\n  chimney-piece, and noticed the handwriting and the postmark. It\r\n  came from Paris, and I think it was a lady’s hand. I am telling\r\n  you about it because of things that happened afterwards.\r\n\r\n  “About ten o’clock, I heard the horse returning, and M. Benassis’\r\n  voice. He said to Nicolle, ‘It is cold enough to-night to bring\r\n  the wolves out. I do not feel at all well.’ Nicolle said, ‘Shall I\r\n  go and wake Jacquotte?’ And M. Benassis answered, ‘Oh! no, no,’\r\n  and came upstairs.\r\n\r\n  “I said, ‘I have your tea here, all ready for you,’ and he smiled\r\n  at me in the way that you know, and said, ‘Thank you, Adrien.’\r\n  That was his last smile. In a moment he began to take off his\r\n  cravat, as though he could not breathe. ‘How hot it is in here!’\r\n  he said and flung himself down in an armchair. ‘A letter has come\r\n  for you, my good friend,’ I said; ‘here it is;’ and I gave him the\r\n  letter. He took it up and glanced at the handwriting. ‘Ah! _mon\r\n  Dieu_!’ he exclaimed, ‘perhaps she is free at last!’ Then his head\r\n  sank back, and his hands shook. After a little while he set the\r\n  lamp on the table and opened the letter. There was something so\r\n  alarming in the cry he had given that I watched him while he read,\r\n  and saw that his face was flushed, and there were tears in his\r\n  eyes. Then quite suddenly he fell, head forwards. I tried to raise\r\n  him, and saw how purple his face was.\r\n\r\n  “‘It is all over with me,’ he said, stammering; it was terrible\r\n  to see how he struggled to rise. ‘I must be bled; bleed me!’ he\r\n  cried, clutching my hand.... ‘Adrien,’ he said again, ‘burn\r\n  this letter!’ He gave it to me, and I threw it on the fire. I\r\n  called for Jacquotte and Nicolle. Jacquotte did not hear me, but\r\n  Nicolle did, and came hurrying upstairs; he helped me to lay M.\r\n  Benassis on my little bed. Our dear friend could not hear us any\r\n  longer when we spoke to him, and although his eyes were open, he\r\n  did not see anything. Nicolle galloped off at once to fetch the\r\n  surgeon, M. Bordier, and in this way spread the alarm through the\r\n  town. It was all astir in a moment. M. Janvier, M. Dufau, and all\r\n  the rest of your acquaintance were the first to come to us. But\r\n  all hope was at an end, M. Benassis was dying fast. He gave no\r\n  sign of consciousness, not even when M. Bordier cauterized the\r\n  soles of his feet. It was an attack of gout, combined with an\r\n  apoplectic stroke.\r\n\r\n  “I am giving you all these details, dear father, because I know\r\n  how much you cared for him. As for me, I am very sad and full of\r\n  grief, for I can say to you that I cared more for him than for any\r\n  one else except you. I learned more from M. Benassis’ talk in the\r\n  evenings than ever I could have learned at school.\r\n\r\n  “You cannot imagine the scene next morning when the news of his\r\n  death was known in the place. The garden and the yard here were\r\n  filled with people. How they sobbed and wailed! Nobody did any\r\n  work that day. Every one recalled the last time that they had seen\r\n  M. Benassis, and what he had said, or they talked of all that he\r\n  had done for them; and those who were least overcome with grief\r\n  spoke for the others. Every one wanted to see him once more, and\r\n  the crowd grew larger every moment. The sad news traveled so fast\r\n  that men and women and children came from ten leagues round; all\r\n  the people in the district, and even beyond it, had that one\r\n  thought in their minds.\r\n\r\n  “It was arranged that four of the oldest men of the commune should\r\n  carry the coffin. It was a very difficult task for them, for the\r\n  crowd was so dense between the church and M. Benassis’ house.\r\n  There must have been nearly five thousand people there, and almost\r\n  every one knelt as if the Host were passing. There was not nearly\r\n  room for them in the church. In spite of their grief, the crowd\r\n  was so silent that you could hear the sound of the bell during\r\n  mass and the chanting as far as the end of the High Street; but\r\n  when the procession started again for the new cemetery, which M.\r\n  Benassis had given to the town, little thinking, poor man, that he\r\n  himself would be the first to be buried there, a great cry went\r\n  up. M. Janvier wept as he said the prayers; there were no dry eyes\r\n  among the crowd. And so we buried him.\r\n\r\n  “As night came on the people dispersed, carrying sorrow and\r\n  mourning everywhere with them. The next day Gondrin and Goguelat,\r\n  and Butifer, with others, set to work to raise a sort of pyramid\r\n  of earth, twenty feet high, above the spot where M. Benassis lies;\r\n  it is being covered now with green sods, and every one is helping\r\n  them. These things, dear father, have all happened in three days.\r\n\r\n  “M. Dufau found M. Benassis’ will lying open on the table where he\r\n  used to write. When it was known how his property had been left,\r\n  affection and regret for his loss became even deeper if possible.\r\n  And now, dear father, I am writing for Butifer (who is taking this\r\n  letter to you) to come back with your answer. You must tell me\r\n  what I am to do. Will you come to fetch me, or shall I go to you\r\n  at Grenoble? Tell me what you wish me to do, and be sure that I\r\n  shall obey you in everything.\r\n\r\n  “Farewell, dear father, I send my love, and I am your affectionate\r\n  son,\r\n\r\n  “ADRIEN GENESTAS.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, I must go over,” the soldier exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe ordered his horse and started out. It was one of those still December\r\nmornings when the sky is covered with gray clouds. The wind was too\r\nlight to disperse the thick fog, through which the bare trees and damp\r\nhouse fronts seemed strangely unfamiliar. The very silence was gloomy.\r\nThere is such a thing as a silence full of light and gladness; on a\r\nbright day there is a certain joyousness about the slightest sound, but\r\nin such dreary weather nature is not silent, she is dumb. All sounds\r\nseemed to die away, stifled by the heavy air.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the gloom without him that harmonized with\r\nColonel Genestas’ mood; his heart was oppressed with grief, and thoughts\r\nof death filled his mind. Involuntarily he began to think of the\r\ncloudless sky on that lovely spring morning, and remembered how bright\r\nthe valley had looked when he passed through it for the first time; and\r\nnow, in strong contrast with that day, the heavy sky above him was a\r\nleaden gray, there was no greenness about the hills, which were still\r\nwaiting for the cloak of winter snow that invests them with a certain\r\nbeauty of its own. There was something painful in all this bleak and\r\nbare desolation for a man who was traveling to find a grave at his\r\njourney’s end; the thought of that grave haunted him. The lines of dark\r\npine-trees here and there along the mountain ridges against the sky\r\nseized on his imagination; they were in keeping with the officer’s\r\nmournful musings. Every time that he looked over the valley that lay\r\nbefore him, he could not help thinking of the trouble that had befallen\r\nthe canton, of the man who had died so lately, and of the blank left by\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nBefore long, Genestas reached the cottage where he had asked for a cup\r\nof milk on his first journey. The sight of the smoke rising above the\r\nhovel where the charity-children were being brought up recalled vivid\r\nmemories of Benassis and of his kindness of heart. The officer made up\r\nhis mind to call there. He would give some alms to the poor woman for\r\nhis dead friend’s sake. He tied his horse to a tree, and opened the door\r\nof the hut without knocking.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, mother,” he said, addressing the old woman, who was sitting\r\nby the fire with the little ones crouching at her side. “Do you remember\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! quite well, sir! You came here one fine morning last spring and\r\ngave us two crowns.”\r\n\r\n“There, mother! that is for you and the children.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you kindly, sir. May Heaven bless you!”\r\n\r\n“You must not thank me, mother,” said the officer; “it is all through M.\r\nBenassis that the money had come to you.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman raised her eyes and gazed at Genestas.\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir,” she said, “he has left his property to our poor countryside,\r\nand made all of us his heirs; but we have lost him who was worth more\r\nthan all, for it was he who made everything turn out well for us.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, mother! Pray for him,” said Genestas, making a few playful\r\ncuts at the children with his riding-whip.\r\n\r\nThe old woman and her little charges went out with him; they watched him\r\nmount his horse and ride away.\r\n\r\nHe followed the road along the valley until he reached the bridle-path\r\nthat led to La Fosseuse’s cottage. From the slope above the house he saw\r\nthat the door was fastened and the shutters closed. In some anxiety he\r\nreturned to the highway, and rode on under the poplars, now bare and\r\nleafless. Before long he overtook the old laborer, who was dressed in\r\nhis Sunday best, and creeping slowly along the road. There was no bag of\r\ntools on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, old Moreau!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! good-day, sir.... I mind who you are now!” the old fellow exclaimed\r\nafter a moment. “You are a friend of monsieur, our late mayor! Ah! sir,\r\nwould it not have been far better if God had only taken a poor rheumatic\r\nold creature like me instead? It would not have mattered if He had taken\r\nme, but HE was the light of our eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know how it is that there is no one at home up there at La\r\nFosseuse’s cottage?”\r\n\r\nThe old man gave a look at the sky.\r\n\r\n“What time is it, sir? The sun has not shone all day,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It is ten o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! well, then, she will have gone to mass or else to the cemetery. She\r\ngoes there every day. He has left her five hundred livres a year and\r\nher house for as long as she lives, but his death has fairly turned her\r\nbrain, as you may say----”\r\n\r\n“And where are you going, old Moreau?”\r\n\r\n“Little Jacques is to be buried to-day, and I am going to the funeral.\r\nHe was my nephew, poor little chap; he had been ailing for a long while,\r\nand he died yesterday morning. It really looked as though it was M.\r\nBenassis who kept him alive. That is the way! All these younger ones\r\ndie!” Moreau added, half-jestingly, half-sadly.\r\n\r\nGenestas reined in his horse as he entered the town, for he met Gondrin\r\nand Goguelat, each carrying a pickaxe and shovel. He called to them,\r\n“Well, old comrades, we have had the misfortune to lose him----”\r\n\r\n“There, there, that is enough, sir!” interrupted Goguelat, “we know that\r\nwell enough. We have just been cutting turf to cover his grave.”\r\n\r\n“His life will make a grand story to tell, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Goguelat, “he was the Napoleon of our valley, barring\r\nthe battles.”\r\n\r\nAs they reached the parsonage, Genestas saw a little group about the\r\ndoor; Butifer and Adrien were talking with M. Janvier, who, no doubt,\r\nhad just returned from saying mass. Seeing that the officer made as\r\nthough he were about to dismount, Butifer promptly went to hold the\r\nhorse, while Adrien sprang forward and flung his arms about his father’s\r\nneck. Genestas was deeply touched by the boy’s affection, though no sign\r\nof this appeared in the soldier’s words or manner.\r\n\r\n“Why, Adrien,” he said, “you certainly are set up again. My goodness!\r\nThanks to our poor friend, you have almost grown into a man. I shall not\r\nforget your tutor here, Master Butifer.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! colonel,” entreated Butifer, “take me away from here and put me\r\ninto your regiment. I cannot trust myself now that M. le Maire is gone.\r\n_He_ wanted me to go for a soldier, didn’t he? Well, then, I will do\r\nwhat he wished. He told you all about me, and you will not be hard on\r\nme, will you, M. Genestas?”\r\n\r\n“Right, my fine fellow,” said Genestas, as he struck his hand in\r\nthe other’s. “I will find something to suit you, set your mind at\r\nrest----And how is it with you, M. le Cure?”\r\n\r\n“Well, like every one else in the canton, colonel, I feel sorrow for\r\nhis loss, but no one knows as I do how irreparable it is. He was like an\r\nangel of God among us. Fortunately, he did not suffer at all; it was a\r\npainless death. The hand of God gently loosed the bonds of a life that\r\nwas one continual blessing to us all.”\r\n\r\n“Will it be intrusive if I ask you to accompany me to the cemetery? I\r\nshould like to bid him farewell, as it were.”\r\n\r\nGenestas and the cure, still in conversation, walked on together.\r\nButifer and Adrien followed them at a few paces distance. They went in\r\nthe direction of the little lake, and as soon as they were clear of the\r\ntown, the lieutenant-colonel saw on the mountain-side a large piece of\r\nwaste land enclosed by walls.\r\n\r\n“That is the cemetery,” the cure told him. “He is the first to be buried\r\nin it. Only three months before he was brought here, it struck him that\r\nit was a very bad arrangement to have the churchyard round the church;\r\nso, in order to carry out the law, which prescribes that burial grounds\r\nshould be removed a stated distance from human dwellings, he himself\r\ngave this piece of land to the commune. We are burying a child, poor\r\nlittle thing, in the new cemetery to-day, so we shall have begun by\r\nlaying innocence and virtue there. Can it be that death is after all\r\na reward? Did God mean it as a lesson for us when He took these two\r\nperfect natures to Himself? When we have been tried and disciplined in\r\nyouth by pain, in later life by mental suffering, are we so much nearer\r\nto Him? Look! there is the rustic monument which has been erected to his\r\nmemory.”\r\n\r\nGenestas saw a mound of earth about twenty feet high. It was bare as\r\nyet, but dwellers in the district were already busily covering the\r\nsloping sides with green turf. La Fosseuse, her face buried in her\r\nhands, was sobbing bitterly; she was sitting on the pile of stones in\r\nwhich they had planted a great wooden cross, made from the trunk of a\r\npine-tree, from which the bark had not been removed. The officer read\r\nthe inscription; the letters were large, and had been deeply cut in the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               D. O. M.\r\n\r\n                              HERE LIES\r\n\r\n                      THE GOOD MONSIEUR BENASSIS\r\n\r\n                         THE FATHER OF US ALL\r\n\r\n                             PRAY FOR HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Was it you, sir,” asked Genestas, “who----?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the cure; “it is simply what is said everywhere, from\r\nthe heights up there above us down to Grenoble, so the words have been\r\ncarved here.”\r\n\r\nGenestas remained silent for a few moments. Then he moved from where he\r\nstood and came nearer to La Fosseuse, who did not hear him, and spoke\r\nagain to the cure.\r\n\r\n“As soon as I have my pension,” he said, “I will come to finish my days\r\nhere among you.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM\r\n\r\nThe following personage appears in other stories of the Human Comedy.\r\n\r\n     Murat, Joachim, Prince\r\n       The Vendetta\r\n       The Gondreville Mystery\r\n       Colonel Chabert\r\n       Domestic Peace"
