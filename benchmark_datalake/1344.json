THE LAST WORD OF TWO GREAT COQUETTES\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the disasters of the revolution of July, which destroyed so many\r\naristocratic fortunes dependent on the court, Madame la Princesse de\r\nCadignan was clever enough to attribute to political events the total\r\nruin she had caused by her own extravagance. The prince left France\r\nwith the royal family, and never returned to it, leaving the princess in\r\nParis, protected by the fact of his absence; for their debts, which\r\nthe sale of all their salable property had not been able to extinguish,\r\ncould only be recovered through him. The revenues of the entailed\r\nestates had been seized. In short, the affairs of this great family were\r\nin as bad a state as those of the elder branch of the Bourbons.\r\n\r\nThis woman, so celebrated under her first name of Duchesse de\r\nMaufrigneuse, very wisely decided to live in retirement, and to make\r\nherself, if possible, forgotten. Paris was then so carried away by the\r\nwhirling current of events that the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, buried in\r\nthe Princesse de Cadignan, a change of name unknown to most of the new\r\nactors brought upon the stage of society by the revolution of July, did\r\nreally become a stranger in her own city.\r\n\r\nIn Paris the title of duke ranks all others, even that of prince;\r\nthough, in heraldic theory, free of all sophism, titles signify nothing;\r\nthere is absolute equality among gentlemen. This fine equality was\r\nformerly maintained by the House of France itself; and in our day it is\r\nso still, at least, nominally; witness the care with which the kings of\r\nFrance give to their sons the simple title of count. It was in virtue of\r\nthis system that Francois I. crushed the splendid titles assumed by the\r\npompous Charles the Fifth, by signing his answer: “Francois, seigneur\r\nde Vanves.” Louis XI. did better still by marrying his daughter to\r\nan untitled gentleman, Pierre de Beaujeu. The feudal system was so\r\nthoroughly broken up by Louis XIV. that the title of duke became, during\r\nhis reign, the supreme honor of the aristocracy, and the most coveted.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are two or three families in France in which the\r\nprincipality, richly endowed in former times, takes precedence of\r\nthe duchy. The house of Cadignan, which possesses the title of Duc de\r\nMaufrigneuse for its eldest sons, is one of these exceptional families.\r\nLike the princes of the house of Rohan in earlier days, the princes of\r\nCadignan had the right to a throne in their own domain; they could have\r\npages and gentlemen in their service. This explanation is necessary,\r\nas much to escape foolish critics who know nothing, as to record the\r\ncustoms of a world which, we are told, is about to disappear, and which,\r\nevidently, so many persons are assisting to push away without knowing\r\nwhat it is.\r\n\r\nThe Cadignans bear: or, five lozenges sable appointed, placed fess-wise,\r\nwith the word “Memini” for motto, a crown with a cap of maintenance,\r\nno supporters or mantle. In these days the great crowd of strangers\r\nflocking to Paris, and the almost universal ignorance of the science of\r\nheraldry, are beginning to bring the title of prince into fashion.\r\nThere are no real princes but those possessed of principalities, to whom\r\nbelongs the title of highness. The disdain shown by the French nobility\r\nfor the title of prince, and the reasons which caused Louis XIV. to give\r\nsupremacy to the title of duke, have prevented Frenchmen from claiming\r\nthe appellation of “highness” for the few princes who exist in France,\r\nthose of Napoleon excepted. This is why the princes of Cadignan hold an\r\ninferior position, nominally, to the princes of the continent.\r\n\r\nThe members of the society called the faubourg Saint-Germain protected\r\nthe princess by a respectful silence due to her name, which is one\r\nof those that all men honor, to her misfortunes, which they ceased to\r\ndiscuss, and to her beauty, the only thing she saved of her departed\r\nopulence. Society, of which she had once been the ornament, was thankful\r\nto her for having, as it were, taken the veil, and cloistered herself\r\nin her own home. This act of good taste was for her, more than for any\r\nother woman, an immense sacrifice. Great deeds are always so keenly felt\r\nin France that the princess gained, by her retreat, as much as she had\r\nlost in public opinion in the days of her splendor.\r\n\r\nShe now saw only one of her old friends, the Marquise d’Espard, and even\r\nto her she never went on festive occasions or to parties. The princess\r\nand the marquise visited each other in the forenoons, with a certain\r\namount of secrecy. When the princess went to dine with her friend,\r\nthe marquise closed her doors. Madame d’Espard treated the princess\r\ncharmingly; she changed her box at the opera, leaving the first tier for\r\na baignoire on the ground-floor, so that Madame de Cadignan could come\r\nto the theatre unseen, and depart incognito. Few women would have been\r\ncapable of a delicacy which deprived them of the pleasure of bearing in\r\ntheir train a fallen rival, and of publicly being her benefactress. Thus\r\nrelieved of the necessity for costly toilets, the princess could enjoy\r\nthe theatre, whither she went in Madame d’Espard’s carriage, which she\r\nwould never have accepted openly in the daytime. No one has ever\r\nknown Madame d’Espard’s reasons for behaving thus to the Princesse de\r\nCadignan; but her conduct was admirable, and for a long time included a\r\nnumber of little acts which, viewed single, seem mere trifles, but taken\r\nin the mass become gigantic.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, three years had thrown a mantle of snow over the follies and\r\nadventures of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse, and had whitened them so\r\nthoroughly that it now required a serious effort of memory to recall\r\nthem. Of the queen once adored by so many courtiers, and whose follies\r\nmight have given a theme to a variety of novels, there remained a woman\r\nstill adorably beautiful, thirty-six years of age, but quite justified\r\nin calling herself thirty, although she was the mother of Duc Georges\r\nde Maufrigneuse, a young man of eighteen, handsome as Antinous, poor as\r\nJob, who was expected to obtain great successes, and for whom his mother\r\ndesired, above all things, to find a rich wife. Perhaps this hope was\r\nthe secret of the intimacy she still kept up with the marquise, in whose\r\nsalon, which was one of the first in Paris, she might eventually be able\r\nto choose among many heiresses for Georges’ wife. The princess saw five\r\nyears between the present moment and her son’s marriage,--five solitary\r\nand desolate years; for, in order to obtain such a marriage for her\r\nson, she knew that her own conduct must be marked in the corner with\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nThe princess lived in the rue de Miromesnil, in a small house, of which\r\nshe occupied the ground-floor at a moderate rent. There she made the\r\nmost of the relics of her past magnificence. The elegance of the great\r\nlady was still redolent about her. She was still surrounded by beautiful\r\nthings which recalled her former existence. On her chimney-piece was a\r\nfine miniature portrait of Charles X., by Madame Mirbel, beneath which\r\nwere engraved the words, “Given by the King”; and, as a pendant, the\r\nportrait of “Madame”, who was always her kind friend. On a table lay an\r\nalbum of costliest price, such as none of the bourgeoises who now lord\r\nit in our industrial and fault-finding society would have dared to\r\nexhibit. This album contained portraits, about thirty in number, of\r\nher intimate friends, whom the world, first and last, had given her as\r\nlovers. The number was a calumny; but had rumor said ten, it might have\r\nbeen, as her friend Madame d’Espard remarked, good, sound gossip. The\r\nportraits of Maxime de Trailles, de Marsay, Rastignac, the Marquis\r\nd’Esgrignon, General Montriveau, the Marquis de Ronquerolles and\r\nd’Ajuda-Pinto, Prince Galathionne, the young Ducs de Grandlieu and de\r\nRhetore, the Vicomte de Serizy, and the handsome Lucien de Rubempre,\r\nhad all been treated with the utmost coquetry of brush and pencil by\r\ncelebrated artists. As the princess now received only two or three of\r\nthese personages, she called the book, jokingly, the collection of her\r\nerrors.\r\n\r\nMisfortune had made this woman a good mother. During the fifteen years\r\nof the Restoration she had amused herself far too much to think of\r\nher son; but on taking refuge in obscurity, this illustrious egoist\r\nbethought her that the maternal sentiment, developed to its extreme,\r\nmight be an absolution for her past follies in the eyes of sensible\r\npersons, who pardon everything to a good mother. She loved her son all\r\nthe more because she had nothing else to love. Georges de Maufrigneuse\r\nwas, moreover, one of those children who flatter the vanities of a\r\nmother; and the princess had, accordingly, made all sorts of sacrifices\r\nfor him. She hired a stable and coach-house, above which he lived in a\r\nlittle entresol with three rooms looking on the street, and charmingly\r\nfurnished; she had even borne several privations to keep a saddle-horse,\r\na cab-horse, and a little groom for his use. For herself, she had only\r\nher own maid, and as cook, a former kitchen-maid. The duke’s groom\r\nhad, therefore, rather a hard place. Toby, formerly tiger to the “late”\r\n Beaudenord (such was the jesting term applied by the gay world to that\r\nruined gentleman),--Toby, who at twenty-five years of age was still\r\nconsidered only fourteen, was expected to groom the horses, clean the\r\ncabriolet, or the tilbury, and the harnesses, accompany his master, take\r\ncare of the apartments, and be in the princess’s antechamber to announce\r\na visitor, if, by chance, she happened to receive one.\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks of what the beautiful Duchesse de Maufrigneuse had been\r\nunder the Restoration,--one of the queens of Paris, a dazzling queen,\r\nwhose luxurious existence equalled that of the richest women of fashion\r\nin London,--there was something touching in the sight of her in that\r\nhumble little abode in the rue de Miromesnil, a few steps away from her\r\nsplendid mansion, which no amount of fortune had enabled her to keep,\r\nand which the hammer of speculators has since demolished. The woman who\r\nthought she was scarcely well served by thirty servants, who possessed\r\nthe most beautiful reception-rooms in all Paris, and the loveliest\r\nlittle private apartments, and who made them the scene of such\r\ndelightful fetes, now lived in a small apartment of five rooms,--an\r\nantechamber, dining-room, salon, one bed-chamber, and a dressing-room,\r\nwith two women-servants only.\r\n\r\n“Ah! she is devoted to her son,” said that clever creature, Madame\r\nd’Espard, “and devoted without ostentation; she is happy. Who would\r\never have believed so frivolous a woman was capable of such persistent\r\nresolution! Our good archbishop has, consequently, greatly encouraged\r\nher; he is most kind to her, and has just induced the old Comtesse de\r\nCinq-Cygne to pay her a visit.”\r\n\r\nLet us admit a truth! One must be a queen to know how to abdicate, and\r\nto descend with dignity from a lofty position which is never wholly\r\nlost. Those only who have an inner consciousness of being nothing in\r\nthemselves, show regrets in falling, or struggle, murmuring, to return\r\nto a past which can never return,--a fact of which they themselves are\r\nwell aware. Compelled to do without the choice exotics in the midst of\r\nwhich she had lived, and which set off so charmingly her whole being\r\n(for it is impossible not to compare her to a flower), the princess\r\nhad wisely chosen a ground-floor apartment; there she enjoyed a pretty\r\nlittle garden which belonged to it,--a garden full of shrubs, and an\r\nalways verdant turf, which brightened her peaceful retreat. She had\r\nabout twelve thousand francs a year; but that modest income was partly\r\nmade up of an annual stipend sent her by the old Duchesse de Navarreins,\r\npaternal aunt of the young duke, and another stipend given by her\r\nmother, the Duchesse d’Uxelles, who was living on her estate in the\r\ncountry, where she economized as old duchesses alone know how to\r\neconomize; for Harpagon is a mere novice compared to them. The princess\r\nstill retained some of her past relations with the exiled royal family;\r\nand it was in her house that the marshal to whom we owe the conquest of\r\nAfrica had conferences, at the time of “Madame’s” attempt in La Vendee,\r\nwith the principal leaders of legitimist opinion,--so great was the\r\nobscurity in which the princess lived, and so little distrust did the\r\ngovernment feel for her in her present distress.\r\n\r\nBeholding the approach of that terrible fortieth year, the bankruptcy of\r\nlove, beyond which there is so little for a woman as woman, the princess\r\nhad flung herself into the kingdom of philosophy. She took to reading,\r\nshe who for sixteen years had felt a cordial horror for serious things.\r\nLiterature and politics are to-day what piety and devotion once were\r\nto her sex,--the last refuge of their feminine pretensions. In her\r\nlate social circle it was said that Diane was writing a book. Since\r\nher transformation from a queen and beauty to a woman of intellect, the\r\nprincess had contrived to make a reception in her little house a great\r\nhonor which distinguished the favored person. Sheltered by her supposed\r\noccupation, she was able to deceive one of her former adorers, de\r\nMarsay, the most influential personage of the political bourgeoisie\r\nbrought to the fore in July 1830. She received him sometimes in the\r\nevenings, and, occupied his attention while the marshal and a few\r\nlegitimists were talking, in a low voice, in her bedroom, about\r\nthe recovery of power, which could be attained only by a general\r\nco-operation of ideas,--the one element of success which all\r\nconspirators overlook. It was the clever vengeance of the pretty woman,\r\nwho thus inveigled the prime minister, and made him act as screen for a\r\nconspiracy against his own government.\r\n\r\nThis adventure, worthy of the finest days of the Fronde, was the text\r\nof a very witty letter, in which the princess rendered to “Madame” an\r\naccount of the negotiations. The Duc de Maufrigneuse went to La Vendee,\r\nand was able to return secretly without being compromised, but not\r\nwithout taking part in “Madame’s” perils; the latter, however, sent\r\nhim home the moment she saw that her cause was lost. Perhaps, had he\r\nremained, the eager vigilance of the young man might have foiled that\r\ntreachery. However great the faults of the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse may\r\nhave seemed in the eyes of the bourgeoisie, the behavior of her son on\r\nthis occasion certainly effaced them in the eyes of the aristocracy.\r\nThere was great nobility and grandeur in thus risking her only son, and\r\nthe heir of an historic name. Some persons are said to intentionally\r\ncover the faults of their private life by public services, and vice\r\nversa; but the Princesse de Cadignan made no such calculation. Possibly\r\nthose who apparently so conduct themselves make none. Events count for\r\nmuch in such cases.\r\n\r\nOn one of the first fine days in the month of May, 1833, the Marquise\r\nd’Espard and the princess were turning about--one could hardly call\r\nit walking--in the single path which wound round the grass-plat in\r\nthe garden, about half-past two in the afternoon, just as the sun was\r\nleaving it. The rays reflected on the walls gave a warm atmosphere\r\nto the little space, which was fragrant with flowers, the gift of the\r\nmarquise.\r\n\r\n“We shall soon lose de Marsay,” said the marquise; “and with him will\r\ndisappear your last hope of fortune for your son. Ever since you played\r\nhim that clever trick, he has returned to his affection for you.”\r\n\r\n“My son will never capitulate to the younger branch,” returned the\r\nprincess, “if he has to die of hunger, or I have to work with my hands\r\nto feed him. Besides, Berthe de Cinq-Cygne has no aversion to him.”\r\n\r\n“Children don’t bind themselves to their parents’ principles,” said\r\nMadame d’Espard.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us talk about it,” said the princess. “If I can’t coax over\r\nthe Marquise de Cinq-Cygne, I shall marry Georges to the daughter of\r\nsome iron-founderer, as that little d’Esgrignon did.”\r\n\r\n“Did you love Victurnien?” asked the marquise.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the princess, gravely, “d’Esgrignon’s simplicity was\r\nreally only a sort of provincial silliness, which I perceived rather too\r\nlate--or, if you choose, too soon.”\r\n\r\n“And de Marsay?”\r\n\r\n“De Marsay played with me as if I were a doll. I was so young at the\r\ntime! We never love men who pretend to teach us; they rub up all our\r\nlittle vanities.”\r\n\r\n“And that wretched boy who hanged himself?”\r\n\r\n“Lucien? An Antinous and a great poet. I worshiped him in all\r\nconscience, and I might have been happy. But he was in love with a girl\r\nof the town; and I gave him up to Madame de Serizy.... If he had cared\r\nto love me, should I have given him up?”\r\n\r\n“What an odd thing, that you should come into collision with an Esther!”\r\n\r\n“She was handsomer than I,” said the Princess.--“Very soon it shall be\r\nthree years that I have lived in solitude,” she resumed, after a pause,\r\n“and this tranquillity has nothing painful to me about it. To you\r\nalone can I dare to say that I feel I am happy. I was surfeited with\r\nadoration, weary of pleasure, emotional on the surface of things, but\r\nconscious that emotion itself never reached my heart. I have found all\r\nthe men whom I have known petty, paltry, superficial; none of them ever\r\ncaused me a surprise; they had no innocence, no grandeur, no delicacy. I\r\nwish I could have met with one man able to inspire me with respect.”\r\n\r\n“Then are you like me, my dear?” asked the marquise; “have you never\r\nfelt the emotion of love while trying to love?”\r\n\r\n“Never,” replied the princess, laying her hand on the arm of her friend.\r\n\r\nThey turned and seated themselves on a rustic bench beneath a jasmine\r\nthen coming into flower. Each had uttered one of those sayings that are\r\nsolemn to women who have reached their age.\r\n\r\n“Like you,” resumed the princess, “I have received more love than most\r\nwomen; but through all my many adventures, I have never found happiness.\r\nI committed great follies, but they had an object, and that object\r\nretreated as fast as I approached it. I feel to-day in my heart, old\r\nas it is, an innocence which has never been touched. Yes, under all my\r\nexperience, lies a first love intact,--just as I myself, in spite of all\r\nmy losses and fatigues, feel young and beautiful. We may love and not\r\nbe happy; we may be happy and never love; but to love and be happy, to\r\nunite those two immense human experiences, is a miracle. That miracle\r\nhas not taken place for me.”\r\n\r\n“Nor for me,” said Madame d’Espard.\r\n\r\n“I own I am pursued in this retreat by dreadful regret: I have amused\r\nmyself all through life, but I have never loved.”\r\n\r\n“What an incredible secret!” cried the marquise.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear,” replied the princess, “such secrets we can tell to\r\nourselves, you and I, but nobody in Paris would believe us.”\r\n\r\n“And,” said the marquise, “if we were not both over thirty-six years of\r\nage, perhaps we would not tell them to each other.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; when women are young they have so many stupid conceits,” replied\r\nthe princess. “We are like those poor young men who play with a\r\ntoothpick to pretend they have dined.”\r\n\r\n“Well, at any rate, here we are!” said Madame d’Espard, with coquettish\r\ngrace, and a charming gesture of well-informed innocence; “and, it seems\r\nto me, sufficiently alive to think of taking our revenge.”\r\n\r\n“When you told me, the other day, that Beatrix had gone off with Conti,\r\nI thought of it all night long,” said the princess, after a pause. “I\r\nsuppose there was happiness in sacrificing her position, her future, and\r\nrenouncing society forever.”\r\n\r\n“She was a little fool,” said Madame d’Espard, gravely. “Mademoiselle\r\ndes Touches was delighted to get rid of Conti. Beatrix never perceived\r\nhow that surrender, made by a superior woman who never for a moment\r\ndefended her claims, proved Conti’s nothingness.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think she will be unhappy?”\r\n\r\n“She is so now,” replied Madame d’Espard. “Why did she leave her\r\nhusband? What an acknowledgment of weakness!”\r\n\r\n“Then you think that Madame de Rochefide was not influenced by the\r\ndesire to enjoy a true love in peace?” asked the princess.\r\n\r\n“No; she was simply imitating Madame de Beausant and Madame de Langeais,\r\nwho, be it said, between you and me, would have been, in a less vulgar\r\nperiod than ours, the La Villiere, the Diane de Poitiers, the Gabrielle\r\nd’Estrees of history.”\r\n\r\n“Less the king, my dear. Ah! I wish I could evoke the shades of those\r\nwomen, and ask them--”\r\n\r\n“But,” said the marquise, interrupting the princess, “why ask the dead?\r\nWe know living women who have been happy. I have talked on this very\r\nsubject a score of times with Madame de Montcornet since she married\r\nthat little Emile Blondet, who makes her the happiest woman in the\r\nworld; not an infidelity, not a thought that turns aside from her; they\r\nare as happy as they were the first day. These long attachments, like\r\nthat of Rastignac and Madame de Nucingen, and your cousin, Madame de\r\nCamps, for her Octave, have a secret, and that secret you and I don’t\r\nknow, my dear. The world has paid us the extreme compliment of thinking\r\nwe are two rakes worthy of the court of the regent; whereas we are, in\r\ntruth, as innocent as a couple of school-girls.”\r\n\r\n“I should like that sort of innocence,” cried the princess, laughing;\r\n“but ours is worse, and it is very humiliating. Well, it is a\r\nmortification we offer up in expiation of our fruitless search; yes,\r\nmy dear, fruitless, for it isn’t probable we shall find in our autumn\r\nseason the fine flower we missed in the spring and summer.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not the question,” resumed the marquise, after a meditative\r\npause. “We are both still beautiful enough to inspire love, but we could\r\nnever convince any one of our innocence and virtue.”\r\n\r\n“If it were a lie, how easy to dress it up with commentaries, and\r\nserve it as some delicious fruit to be eagerly swallowed! But how is\r\nit possible to get a truth believed? Ah! the greatest of men have been\r\nmistaken there!” added the princess, with one of those meaning smiles\r\nwhich the pencil of Leonardo da Vinci alone has rendered.\r\n\r\n“Fools love well, sometimes,” returned the marquise.\r\n\r\n“But in this case,” said the princess, “fools wouldn’t have enough\r\ncredulity in their nature.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said the marquise. “But what we ought to look for is\r\nneither a fool nor even a man of talent. To solve our problem we need a\r\nman of genius. Genius alone has the faith of childhood, the religion of\r\nlove, and willingly allows us to band its eyes. Look at Canalis and the\r\nDuchesse de Chaulieu! Though we have both encountered men of genius,\r\nthey were either too far removed from us or too busy, and we too\r\nabsorbed, too frivolous.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! how I wish I might not leave this world without knowing the\r\nhappiness of true love,” exclaimed the princess.\r\n\r\n“It is nothing to inspire it,” said Madame d’Espard; “the thing is to\r\nfeel it. I see many women who are only the pretext for a passion without\r\nbeing both its cause and its effect.”\r\n\r\n“The last love I inspired was a beautiful and sacred thing,” said the\r\nprincess. “It had a future in it. Chance had brought me, for once in a\r\nway, the man of genius who is due to us, and yet so difficult to obtain;\r\nthere are more pretty women than men of genius. But the devil interfered\r\nwith the affair.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about it, my dear; this is all news to me.”\r\n\r\n“I first noticed this beautiful passion about the middle of the winter\r\nof 1829. Every Friday, at the opera, I observed a young man, about\r\nthirty years of age, in the orchestra stalls, who evidently came there\r\nfor me. He was always in the same stall, gazing at me with eyes of fire,\r\nbut, seemingly, saddened by the distance between us, perhaps by the\r\nhopelessness of reaching me.”\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow! When a man loves he becomes eminently stupid,” said the\r\nmarquise.\r\n\r\n“Between every act he would slip into the corridor,” continued the\r\nprincess, smiling at her friend’s epigrammatic remark. “Once or twice,\r\neither to see me or to make me see him, he looked through the glass\r\nsash of the box exactly opposite to mine. If I received a visit, I was\r\ncertain to see him in the corridor close to my door, casting a furtive\r\nglance upon me. He had apparently learned to know the persons belonging\r\nto my circle; and he followed them when he saw them turning in the\r\ndirection of my box, in order to obtain the benefit of the opening door.\r\nI also found my mysterious adorer at the Italian opera-house; there he\r\nhad a stall directly opposite to my box, where he could gaze at me in\r\nnaive ecstasy--oh! it was pretty! On leaving either house I always found\r\nhim planted in the lobby, motionless; he was elbowed and jostled, but\r\nhe never moved. His eyes grew less brilliant if he saw me on the arm of\r\nsome favorite. But not a word, not a letter, no demonstration. You must\r\nacknowledge that was in good taste. Sometimes, on getting home late\r\nat night, I found him sitting upon one of the stone posts of the\r\nporte-cochere. This lover of mine had very handsome eyes, a long, thick,\r\nfan-shaped beard, with a moustache and side-whiskers; nothing could be\r\nseen of his skin but his white cheek-bones, and a noble forehead; it was\r\ntruly an antique head. The prince, as you know, defended the Tuileries\r\non the riverside, during the July days. He returned to Saint-Cloud that\r\nnight, when all was lost, and said to me: ‘I came near being killed at\r\nfour o’clock. I was aimed at by one of the insurgents, when a young\r\nman, with a long beard, whom I have often seen at the opera, and who was\r\nleading the attack, threw up the man’s gun, and saved me.’ So my adorer\r\nwas evidently a republican! In 1831, after I came to lodge in this\r\nhouse, I found him, one day, leaning with his back against the wall of\r\nit; he seemed pleased with my disasters; possibly he may have thought\r\nthey drew us nearer together. But after the affair of Saint-Merri I\r\nsaw him no more; he was killed there. The evening before the funeral of\r\nGeneral Lamarque, I had gone out on foot with my son, and my republican\r\naccompanied us, sometimes behind, sometimes in front, from the Madeleine\r\nto the Passage des Panoramas, where I was going.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” asked the marquise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, all,” replied the princess. “Except that on the morning\r\nSaint-Merri was taken, a gamin came here and insisted on seeing me. He\r\ngave me a letter, written on common paper, signed by my republican.”\r\n\r\n“Show it to me,” said the marquise.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear. Love was too great and too sacred in the heart of that\r\nman to let me violate its secrets. The letter, short and terrible, still\r\nstirs my soul when I think of it. That dead man gives me more emotions\r\nthan all the living men I ever coquetted with; he constantly recurs to\r\nmy mind.”\r\n\r\n“What was his name?” asked the marquise.\r\n\r\n“Oh! a very common one: Michel Chrestien.”\r\n\r\n“You have done well to tell me,” said Madame d’Espard, eagerly. “I have\r\noften heard of him. This Michel Chrestien was the intimate friend of\r\na remarkable man you have already expressed a wish to see,--Daniel\r\nd’Arthez, who comes to my house some two or three times a year.\r\nChrestien, who was really killed at Saint-Merri, had no lack of friends.\r\nI have heard it said that he was one of those born statesmen to whom,\r\nlike de Marsay, nothing is wanting but opportunity to become all they\r\nmight be.”\r\n\r\n“Then he had better be dead,” said the princess, with a melancholy air,\r\nunder which she concealed her thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Will you come to my house some evening and meet d’Arthez?” said the\r\nmarquise. “You can talk of your ghost.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will,” replied the princess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. DANIEL D’ARTHEZ\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after this conversation Blondet and Rastignac, who knew\r\nd’Arthez, promised Madame d’Espard that they would bring him to dine\r\nwith her. This promise might have proved rash had it not been for\r\nthe name of the princess, a meeting with whom was not a matter of\r\nindifference to the great writer.\r\n\r\nDaniel d’Arthez, one of the rare men who, in our day, unite a noble\r\ncharacter with great talent, had already obtained, not all the\r\npopularity his works deserve, but a respectful esteem to which souls\r\nof his own calibre could add nothing. His reputation will certainly\r\nincrease; but in the eyes of connoisseurs it had already attained its\r\nfull development. He is one of those authors who, sooner or later, are\r\nput in their right place, and never lose it. A poor nobleman, he had\r\nunderstood his epoch well enough to seek personal distinction only. He\r\nhad struggled long in the Parisian arena, against the wishes of a rich\r\nuncle who, by a contradiction which vanity must explain, after leaving\r\nhis nephew a prey to the utmost penury, bequeathed to the man who had\r\nreached celebrity the fortune so pitilessly refused to the unknown\r\nwriter. This sudden change in his position made no change in Daniel\r\nd’Arthez’s habits; he continued to work with a simplicity worthy of\r\nthe antique past, and even assumed new toils by accepting a seat in the\r\nChamber of Deputies, where he took his seat on the Right.\r\n\r\nSince his accession to fame he had sometimes gone into society. One of\r\nhis old friends, the now-famous physician, Horace Bianchon, persuaded\r\nhim to make the acquaintance of the Baron de Rastignac, under-secretary\r\nof State, and a friend of de Marsay, the prime minister. These two\r\npolitical officials acquiesced, rather nobly, in the strong wish of\r\nd’Arthez, Bianchon, and other friends of Michel Chrestien for the\r\nremoval of the body of that republican to the church of Saint-Merri for\r\nthe purpose of giving it funeral honors. Gratitude for a service which\r\ncontrasted with the administrative rigor displayed at a time when\r\npolitical passions were so violent, had bound, so to speak, d’Arthez to\r\nRastignac. The latter and de Marsay were much too clever not to profit\r\nby that circumstance; and thus they won over other friends of Michel\r\nChrestien, who did not share his political opinions, and who now\r\nattached themselves to the new government. One of them, Leon Giraud,\r\nappointed in the first instance master of petitions, became eventually a\r\nCouncillor of State.\r\n\r\nThe whole existence of Daniel d’Arthez is consecrated to work; he sees\r\nsociety only by snatches; it is to him a sort of dream. His house is a\r\nconvent, where he leads the life of a Benedictine; the same sobriety of\r\nregimen, the same regularity of occupation. His friends knew that up to\r\nthe present time woman had been to him no more than an always dreaded\r\ncircumstance; he had observed her too much not to fear her; but by dint\r\nof studying her he had ceased to understand her,--like, in this, to\r\nthose deep strategists who are always beaten on unexpected ground,\r\nwhere their scientific axioms are either modified or contradicted. In\r\ncharacter he still remains a simple-hearted child, all the while\r\nproving himself an observer of the first rank. This contrast, apparently\r\nimpossible, is explainable to those who know how to measure the depths\r\nwhich separate faculties from feelings; the former proceed from the\r\nhead, the latter from the heart. A man can be a great man and a wicked\r\none, just as he can be a fool and a devoted lover. D’Arthez is one of\r\nthose privileged beings in whom shrewdness of mind and a broad expanse\r\nof the qualities of the brain do not exclude either the strength or\r\nthe grandeur of sentiments. He is, by rare privilege, equally a man of\r\naction and a man of thought. His private life is noble and generous. If\r\nhe carefully avoided love, it was because he knew himself, and felt a\r\npremonition of the empire such a passion would exercise upon him.\r\n\r\nFor several years the crushing toil by which he prepared the solid\r\nground of his subsequent works, and the chill of poverty, were\r\nmarvellous preservatives. But when ease with his inherited fortune came\r\nto him, he formed a vulgar and most incomprehensible connection with a\r\nrather handsome woman, belonging to the lower classes, without education\r\nor manners, whom he carefully concealed from every eye. Michel Chrestien\r\nattributed to men of genius the power of transforming the most\r\nmassive creatures into sylphs, fools into clever women, peasants into\r\ncountesses; the more accomplished a woman was, the more she lost her\r\nvalue in their eyes, for, according to Michel, their imagination had the\r\nless to do. In his opinion love, a mere matter of the senses to inferior\r\nbeings, was to great souls the most immense of all moral creations\r\nand the most binding. To justify d’Arthez, he instanced the example of\r\nRaffaele and the Fornarina. He might have offered himself as an\r\ninstance for this theory, he who had seen an angel in the Duchesse\r\nde Maufrigneuse. This strange fancy of d’Arthez might, however, be\r\nexplained in other ways; perhaps he had despaired of meeting here below\r\nwith a woman who answered to that delightful vision which all men of\r\nintellect dream of and cherish; perhaps his heart was too sensitive, too\r\ndelicate, to yield itself to a woman of society; perhaps he thought best\r\nto let nature have her way, and keep his illusions by cultivating his\r\nideal; perhaps he had laid aside love as being incompatible with his\r\nwork and the regularity of a monastic life which love would have wholly\r\nupset.\r\n\r\nFor several months past d’Arthez had been subjected to the jests and\r\nsatire of Blondet and Rastignac, who reproached him with knowing neither\r\nthe world nor women. According to them, his authorship was sufficiently\r\nadvanced, and his works numerous enough, to allow him a few\r\ndistractions; he had a fine fortune, and here he was living like a\r\nstudent; he enjoyed nothing,--neither his money nor his fame; he was\r\nignorant of the exquisite enjoyments of the noble and delicate love\r\nwhich well-born and well-bred women could inspire and feel; he knew\r\nnothing of the charming refinements of language, nothing of the proofs\r\nof affection incessantly given by refined women to the commonest things.\r\nHe might, perhaps, know woman; but he knew nothing of the divinity.\r\nWhy not take his rightful place in the world, and taste the delights of\r\nParisian society?\r\n\r\n“Why doesn’t a man who bears party per bend gules and or, a bezant and\r\ncrab counterchanged,” cried Rastignac, “display that ancient escutcheon\r\nof Picardy on the panels of a carriage? You have thirty thousand francs\r\na year, and the proceeds of your pen; you have justified your motto:\r\nArs thesaurusque virtus, that punning device our ancestors were always\r\nseeking, and yet you never appear in the Bois de Boulogne! We live in\r\ntimes when virtue ought to show itself.”\r\n\r\n“If you read your works to that species of stout Laforet, whom you seem\r\nto fancy, I would forgive you,” said Blondet. “But, my dear fellow, you\r\nare living on dry bread, materially speaking; in the matter of intellect\r\nyou haven’t even bread.”\r\n\r\nThis friendly little warfare had been going on for several months\r\nbetween Daniel and his friends, when Madame d’Espard asked Rastignac and\r\nBlondet to induce d’Arthez to come and dine with her, telling them that\r\nthe Princesse de Cadignan had a great desire to see that celebrated\r\nman. Such curiosities are to certain women what magic lanterns are\r\nto children,--a pleasure to the eyes, but rather shallow and full\r\nof disappointments. The more sentiments a man of talent excites at\r\na distance, the less he responds to them on nearer view; the more\r\nbrilliant fancy has pictured him, the duller he will seem in reality.\r\nConsequently, disenchanted curiosity is often unjust.\r\n\r\nNeither Blondet nor Rastignac could deceive d’Arthez; but they told\r\nhim, laughing, that they now offered him a most seductive opportunity\r\nto polish up his heart and know the supreme fascinations which love\r\nconferred on a Parisian great lady. The princess was evidently in love\r\nwith him; he had nothing to fear but everything to gain by accepting the\r\ninterview; it was quite impossible he could descend from the pedestal on\r\nwhich madame de Cadignan had placed him. Neither Blondet nor Rastignac\r\nsaw any impropriety in attributing this love to the princess; she whose\r\npast had given rise to so many anecdotes could very well stand that\r\nlesser calumny. Together they began to relate to d’Arthez the adventures\r\nof the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse: her first affair with de Marsay; her\r\nsecond with d’Ajuda, whom she had, they said, distracted from his wife,\r\nthus avenging Madame de Beausant; also her later connection with young\r\nd’Esgrignon, who had travelled with her in Italy, and had horribly\r\ncompromised himself on her account; after that they told him how unhappy\r\nshe had been with a certain celebrated ambassador, how happy with a\r\nRussian general, besides becoming the Egeria of two ministers of Foreign\r\naffairs, and various other anecdotes. D’Arthez replied that he knew a\r\ngreat deal more than they could tell him about her through their poor\r\nfriend, Michel Chrestien, who adored her secretly for four years, and\r\nhad well-nigh gone mad about her.\r\n\r\n“I have often accompanied him,” said Daniel, “to the opera. He would\r\nmake me run through the streets as far as her horses that he might see\r\nthe princess through the window of her coupe.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there you have a topic all ready for you,” said Blondet, smiling.\r\n“This is the very woman you need; she’ll initiate you most gracefully\r\ninto the mysteries of elegance; but take care! she has wasted many\r\nfortunes. The beautiful Diane is one of those spendthrifts who don’t\r\ncost a penny, but for whom a man spends millions. Give yourself up to\r\nher, body and soul, if you choose; but keep your money in your hand,\r\nlike the old fellow in Girodet’s ‘Deluge.’”\r\n\r\nFrom the tenor of these remarks it was to be inferred that the princess\r\nhad the depth of a precipice, the grace of a queen, the corruption\r\nof diplomatists, the mystery of a first initiation, and the dangerous\r\nqualities of a siren. The two clever men of the world, incapable of\r\nforeseeing the denouement of their joke, succeeded in presenting Diane\r\nd’Uxelles as a consummate specimen of the Parisian woman, the cleverest\r\nof coquettes, the most enchanting mistress in the world. Right or wrong,\r\nthe woman whom they thus treated so lightly was sacred to d’Arthez; his\r\ndesire to meet her needed no spur; he consented to do so at the first\r\nword, which was all the two friends wanted of him.\r\n\r\nMadame d’Espard went to see the princess as soon as she had received\r\nthis answer.\r\n\r\n“My dear, do you feel yourself in full beauty and coquetry?” she said.\r\n“If so, come and dine with me a few days hence, and I’ll serve up\r\nd’Arthez. Our man of genius is by nature, it seems, a savage; he\r\nfears women, and has never loved! Make your plans on that. He is\r\nall intellect, and so simple that he’ll mislead you into feeling no\r\ndistrust. But his penetration, which is wholly retrospective, acts\r\nlater, and frustrates calculation. You may hoodwink him to-day, but\r\nto-morrow nothing can dupe him.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried the princess, “if I were only thirty years old what\r\namusement I might have with him! The one enjoyment I have lacked up to\r\nthe present is a man of intellect to fool. I have had only partners,\r\nnever adversaries. Love was a mere game instead of being a battle.”\r\n\r\n“Dear princess, admit that I am very generous; for, after all, you\r\nknow!--charity begins at home.”\r\n\r\nThe two women looked at each other, laughing, and clasped hands in a\r\nfriendly way. Assuredly they both knew each other’s secrets, and this\r\nwas not the first man nor the first service that one had given to the\r\nother; for sincere and lasting friendships between women of the world\r\nneed to be cemented by a few little crimes. When two friends are liable\r\nto kill each other reciprocally, and see a poisoned dagger in each\r\nother’s hand, they present a touching spectacle of harmony, which is\r\nnever troubled, unless, by chance, one of them is careless enough to\r\ndrop her weapon.\r\n\r\nSo, eight days later, a little dinner such as are given to intimates by\r\nverbal invitation only, during which the doors are closed to all other\r\nvisitors, took place at Madame d’Espard’s house. Five persons were\r\ninvited,--Emile Blondet and Madame de Montcornet, Daniel d’Arthez,\r\nRastignac, and the Princesse de Cadignan. Counting the mistress of the\r\nhouse, there were as many men as women.\r\n\r\nChance never exerted itself to make wiser preparations than those which\r\nopened the way to a meeting between d’Arthez and Madame de Cadignan.\r\nThe princess is still considered one of the chief authorities on dress,\r\nwhich, to women, is the first of arts. On this occasion she wore a gown\r\nof blue velvet with flowing white sleeves, and a tulle guimpe, slightly\r\nfrilled and edged with blue, covering the shoulders, and rising nearly\r\nto the throat, as we see in several of Raffaele’s portraits. Her maid\r\nhad dressed her hair with white heather, adroitly placed among its blond\r\ncascades, which were one of the great beauties to which she owed her\r\ncelebrity.\r\n\r\nCertainly Diane did not look to be more than twenty-five years old.\r\nFour years of solitude and repose had restored the freshness of her\r\ncomplexion. Besides, there are moments when the desire to please gives\r\nan increase of beauty to women. The will is not without influence on the\r\nvariations of the face. If violent emotions have the power to yellow\r\nthe white tones of persons of bilious and melancholy temperament, and to\r\ngreen lymphatic faces, shall we not grant to desire, hope, and joy,\r\nthe faculty of clearing the skin, giving brilliancy to the eye, and\r\nbrightening the glow of beauty with a light as jocund as that of a\r\nlovely morning? The celebrated faintness of the princess had taken on\r\na ripeness which now made her seem more august. At this moment of her\r\nlife, impressed by her many vicissitudes and by serious reflections,\r\nher noble, dreamy brow harmonized delightfully with the slow, majestic\r\nglance of her blue eyes. It was impossible for the ablest physiognomist\r\nto imagine calculation or self-will beneath that unspeakable delicacy of\r\nfeature. There were faces of women which deceive knowledge, and mislead\r\nobservation by their calmness and delicacy; it is necessary to examine\r\nsuch faces when passions speak, and that is difficult, or after they\r\nhave spoken, which is no longer of any use, for then the woman is old\r\nand has ceased to dissimulate.\r\n\r\nThe princess is one of those impenetrable women; she can make herself\r\nwhat she pleases to be: playful, childlike, distractingly innocent; or\r\nreflective, serious, and profound enough to excite anxiety. She came to\r\nMadame d’Espard’s dinner with the intention of being a gentle, simple\r\nwoman, to whom life was known only through its deceptions: a woman full\r\nof soul, and calumniated, but resigned,--in short, a wounded angel.\r\n\r\nShe arrived early, so as to pose on a sofa near the fire beside Madame\r\nd’Espard, as she wished to be first seen: that is, in one of\r\nthose attitudes in which science is concealed beneath an exquisite\r\nnaturalness; a studied attitude, putting in relief the beautiful\r\nserpentine outline which, starting from the foot, rises gracefully to\r\nthe hip, and continues with adorable curves to the shoulder, presenting,\r\nin fact, a profile of the whole body. With a subtlety which few women\r\nwould have dreamed of, Diane, to the great amazement of the marquise,\r\nhad brought her son with her. After a moment’s reflection, Madame\r\nd’Espard pressed the princess’s hand, with a look of intelligence that\r\nseemed to say:--\r\n\r\n“I understand you! By making d’Arthez accept all the difficulties at\r\nonce you will not have to conquer them later.”\r\n\r\nRastignac brought d’Arthez. The princess made none of those compliments\r\nto the celebrated author with which vulgar persons overwhelmed him; but\r\nshe treated him with a kindness full of graceful respect, which, with\r\nher, was the utmost extent of her concessions. Her manner was doubtless\r\nthe same with the King of France and the royal princes. She seemed happy\r\nto see this great man, and glad that she had sought him. Persons of\r\ntaste, like the princess, are especially distinguished for their manner\r\nof listening, for an affability without superciliousness, which is to\r\npoliteness what practice is to virtue. When the celebrated man spoke,\r\nshe took an attentive attitude, a thousand times more flattering than\r\nthe best-seasoned compliments. The mutual presentation was made quietly,\r\nwithout emphasis, and in perfectly good taste, by the marquise.\r\n\r\nAt dinner d’Arthez was placed beside the princess, who, far from\r\nimitating the eccentricities of diet which many affected women display,\r\nate her dinner with a very good appetite, making it a point of honor\r\nto seem a natural woman, without strange ways or fancies. Between two\r\ncourses she took advantage of the conversation becoming general to say\r\nto d’Arthez, in a sort of aside:--\r\n\r\n“The secret of the pleasure I take in finding myself beside you, is\r\nthe desire I feel to learn something of an unfortunate friend of yours,\r\nmonsieur. He died for another cause greater than ours; but I was under\r\nthe greatest obligations to him, although unable to acknowledge or thank\r\nhim for them. I know that you were one of his best friends. Your mutual\r\nfriendship, pure and unalterable, is a claim upon me. You will not, I am\r\nsure, think it extraordinary, that I have wished to know all you could\r\ntell me of a man so dear to you. Though I am attached to the exiled\r\nfamily, and bound, of course, to hold monarchical opinions, I am not\r\namong those who think it is impossible to be both republican and noble\r\nin heart. Monarchy and the republic are two forms of government which do\r\nnot stifle noble sentiments.”\r\n\r\n“Michel Chrestien was an angel, madame,” replied Daniel, in a voice of\r\nemotion. “I don’t know among the heroes of antiquity a greater than he.\r\nBe careful not to think him one of those narrow-minded republicans who\r\nwould like to restore the Convention and the amenities of the Committee\r\nof Public Safety. No, Michel dreamed of the Swiss federation applied\r\nto all Europe. Let us own, between ourselves, that _after_ the glorious\r\ngovernment of one man only, which, as I think, is particularly suited to\r\nour nation, Michel’s system would lead to the suppression of war in this\r\nold world, and its reconstruction on bases other than those of conquest,\r\nwhich formerly feudalized it. From this point of view the republicans\r\ncame nearest to his idea. That is why he lent them his arm in July, and\r\nwas killed at Saint-Merri. Though completely apart in opinion, he and I\r\nwere closely bound together as friends.”\r\n\r\n“That is noble praise for both natures,” said Madame de Cadignan,\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n“During the last four years of his life,” continued Daniel, “he made to\r\nme alone a confidence of his love for you, and this confidence knitted\r\ncloser than ever the already strong ties of brotherly affection. He\r\nalone, madame, can have loved you as you ought to be loved. Many a time\r\nI have been pelted with rain as we accompanied your carriage at the pace\r\nof the horses, to keep at a parallel distance, and see you--admire you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur,” said the princess, “how can I repay such feelings!”\r\n\r\n“Why is Michel not here!” exclaimed Daniel, in melancholy accents.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he would not have loved me long,” said the princess, shaking\r\nher head sadly. “Republicans are more absolute in their ideas than we\r\nabsolutists, whose fault is indulgence. No doubt he imagined me perfect,\r\nand society would have cruelly undeceived him. We are pursued, we women,\r\nby as many calumnies as you authors are compelled to endure in your\r\nliterary life; but we, alas! cannot defend ourselves either by our works\r\nor by our fame. The world will not believe us to be what we are, but\r\nwhat it thinks us to be. It would soon have hidden from his eyes the\r\nreal but unknown woman that is in me, behind the false portrait of the\r\nimaginary woman which the world considers true. He would have come to\r\nthink me unworthy of the noble feelings he had for me, and incapable of\r\ncomprehending him.”\r\n\r\nHere the princess shook her head, swaying the beautiful blond curls,\r\nfull of heather, with a touching gesture. This plaintive expression of\r\ngrievous doubts and hidden sorrows is indescribable. Daniel understood\r\nthem all; and he looked at the princess with keen emotion.\r\n\r\n“And yet, the night on which I last saw him, after the revolution of\r\nJuly, I was on the point of giving way to the desire I felt to take\r\nhis hand and press it before all the world, under the peristyle of the\r\nopera-house. But the thought came to me that such a proof of gratitude\r\nmight be misinterpreted; like so many other little things done\r\nfrom noble motives which are called to-day the follies of Madame de\r\nMaufrigneuse--things which I can never explain, for none but my son and\r\nGod have understood me.”\r\n\r\nThese words, breathed into the ear of the listener, in tones inaudible\r\nto the other guests, and with accents worthy of the cleverest actress,\r\nwere calculated to reach the heart; and they did reach that of d’Arthez.\r\nThere was no question of himself in the matter; this woman was seeking\r\nto rehabilitate herself in favor of the dead. She had been calumniated;\r\nand she evidently wanted to know if anything had tarnished her in the\r\neyes of him who had loved her; had he died with all his illusions?\r\n\r\n“Michel,” replied d’Arthez, “was one of those men who love absolutely,\r\nand who, if they choose ill, can suffer without renouncing the woman\r\nthey have once elected.”\r\n\r\n“Was I loved thus?” she said, with an air of exalted beatitude.\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame.”\r\n\r\n“I made his happiness?”\r\n\r\n“For four years.”\r\n\r\n“A woman never hears of such a thing without a sentiment of proud\r\nsatisfaction,” she said, turning her sweet and noble face to d’Arthez\r\nwith a movement full of modest confusion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most skilful manoeuvres of these actresses is to veil their\r\nmanner when words are too expressive, and speak with their eyes when\r\nlanguage is restrained. These clever discords, slipped into the music of\r\ntheir love, be it false or true, produce irresistible attractions.\r\n\r\n“Is it not,” she said, lowering her voice and her eyes, after feeling\r\nwell assured they had produced her effect,--“is it not fulfilling one’s\r\ndestiny to have rendered a great man happy?”\r\n\r\n“Did he not write that to you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I wanted to be sure, quite sure; for, believe me, monsieur, in\r\nputting me so high he was not mistaken.”\r\n\r\nWomen know how to give a peculiar sacredness to their words; they\r\ncommunicate something vibrant to them, which extends the meaning\r\nof their ideas, and gives them depth; though later their fascinated\r\nlistener may not remember precisely what they said, their end has been\r\ncompletely attained,--which is the object of all eloquence. The princess\r\nmight at that moment have been wearing the diadem of France, and her\r\nbrow could not have seemed more imposing than it was beneath that crown\r\nof golden hair, braided like a coronet, and adorned with heather. She\r\nwas simple and calm; nothing betrayed a sense of any necessity to appear\r\nso, nor any desire to seem grand or loving. D’Arthez, the solitary\r\ntoiler, to whom the ways of the world were unknown, whom study had\r\nwrapped in its protecting veils, was the dupe of her tones and words. He\r\nwas under the spell of those exquisite manners; he admired that perfect\r\nbeauty, ripened by misfortune, placid in retirement; he adored the union\r\nof so rare a mind and so noble a soul; and he longed to become, himself,\r\nthe heir of Michel Chrestien.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this passion was, as in the case of almost all deep\r\nthinkers, an idea. Looking at the princess, studying the shape of her\r\nhead, the arrangement of those sweet features, her figure, her hand,\r\nso finely modelled, closer than when he accompanied his friend in\r\ntheir wild rush through the streets, he was struck by the surprising\r\nphenomenon of the moral second-sight which a man exalted by love\r\ninvariably finds within him. With what lucidity had Michel Chrestien\r\nread into that soul, that heart, illumined by the fires of love! Thus\r\nthe princess acquired, in d’Arthez’s eyes, another charm; a halo of\r\npoesy surrounded her.\r\n\r\nAs the dinner proceeded, Daniel called to mind the various confidences\r\nof his friend, his despair, his hopes, the noble poems of a true\r\nsentiment sung to his ear alone, in honor of this woman. It is rare that\r\na man passes without remorse from the position of confidant to that of\r\nrival, and d’Arthez was free to do so without dishonor. He had suddenly,\r\nin a moment, perceived the enormous differences existing between a\r\nwell-bred woman, that flower of the great world, and common women,\r\nthough of the latter he did not know beyond one specimen. He was thus\r\ncaptured on the most accessible and sensitive sides of his soul and of\r\nhis genius. Impelled by his simplicity, and by the impetuosity of his\r\nideas, to lay immediate claim to this woman, he found himself restrained\r\nby society, also by the barrier which the manners and, let us say the\r\nword, the majesty of the princess placed between them. The conversation,\r\nwhich remained upon the topic of Michel Chrestien until the dessert, was\r\nan excellent pretext for both to speak in a low voice: love, sympathy,\r\ncomprehension! she could pose as a maligned and misunderstood woman; he\r\ncould slip his feet into the shoes of the dead republican. Perhaps his\r\ncandid mind detected itself in regretting his dead friend less. The\r\nprincess, at the moment when the dessert appeared upon the table, and\r\nthe guests were separated by a brilliant hedge of fruits and sweetmeats,\r\nthought best to put an end to this flow of confidences by a charming\r\nlittle speech, in which she delicately expressed the idea that Daniel\r\nand Michel were twin souls.\r\n\r\nAfter this d’Arthez threw himself into the general conversation with\r\nthe gayety of a child, and a self-conceited air that was worthy of a\r\nschoolboy. When they left the dining-room, the princess took d’Arthez’s\r\narm, in the simplest manner, to return to Madame d’Espard’s little\r\nsalon. As they crossed the grand salon she walked slowly, and when\r\nsufficiently separated from the marquise, who was on Blondet’s arm, she\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to be inaccessible to the friend of that poor man,”\r\n she said to d’Arthez; “and though I have made it a rule to receive no\r\nvisitors, you will always be welcome in my house. Do not think this a\r\nfavor. A favor is only for strangers, and to my mind you and I seem old\r\nfriends; I see in you the brother of Michel.”\r\n\r\nD’Arthez could only press her arm, unable to make other reply.\r\n\r\nAfter coffee was served, Diane de Cadignan wrapped herself, with\r\ncoquettish motions, in a large shawl, and rose. Blondet and Rastignac\r\nwere too much men of the world, and too polite to make the least\r\nremonstrance, or try to detain her; but Madame d’Espard compelled her\r\nfriend to sit down again, whispering in her ear:--\r\n\r\n“Wait till the servants have had their dinner; the carriage is not ready\r\nyet.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the marquise made a sign to the footman, who was taking away\r\nthe coffee-tray. Madame de Montcornet perceived that the princess and\r\nMadame d’Espard had a word to say to each other, and she drew around her\r\nd’Arthez, Rastignac, and Blondet, amusing them with one of those clever\r\nparadoxical attacks which Parisian women understand so thoroughly.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the marquise to Diane, “what do you think of him?”\r\n\r\n“He is an adorable child, just out of swaddling-clothes! This time, like\r\nall other times, it will only be a triumph without a struggle.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it is disappointing,” said Madame d’Espard. “But we might evade\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Let me be your rival.”\r\n\r\n“Just as you please,” replied the princess. “I’ve decided on my course.\r\nGenius is a condition of the brain; I don’t know what the heart gets out\r\nof it; we’ll talk about that later.”\r\n\r\nHearing the last few words, which were wholly incomprehensible to her,\r\nMadame d’Espard returned to the general conversation, showing neither\r\noffence at that indifferent “As you please,” nor curiosity as to the\r\noutcome of the interview. The princess stayed an hour longer, seated on\r\nthe sofa near the fire, in the careless, nonchalant attitude of Guerin’s\r\nDido, listening with the attention of an absorbed mind, and looking\r\nat Daniel now and then, without disguising her admiration, which never\r\nwent, however, beyond due limits. She slipped away when the carriage\r\nwas announced, with a pressure of the hand to the marquise, and an\r\ninclination of the head to Madame de Montcornet.\r\n\r\nThe evening concluded without any allusion to the princess. The other\r\nguests profited by the sort of exaltation which d’Arthez had reached,\r\nfor he put forth the treasures of his mind. In Blondet and Rastignac\r\nhe certainly had two acolytes of the first quality to bring forth the\r\ndelicacy of his wit and the breadth of his intellect. As for the two\r\nwomen, they had long been counted among the cleverest in society. This\r\nevening was like a halt in the oasis of a desert,--a rare enjoyment,\r\nand well appreciated by these four persons, habitually victimized to the\r\nendless caution entailed by the world of salons and politics. There\r\nare beings who have the privilege of passing among men like beneficent\r\nstars, whose light illumines the mind, while its rays send a glow to\r\nthe heart. D’Arthez was one of those beings. A writer who rises to his\r\nlevel, accustoms himself to free thought, and forgets that in society\r\nall things cannot be said; it is impossible for such a man to observe\r\nthe restraint of persons who live in the world perpetually; but as his\r\neccentricities of thought bore the mark of originality, no one felt\r\ninclined to complain. This zest, this piquancy, rare in mere talent,\r\nthis youthfulness and simplicity of soul which made d’Arthez so nobly\r\noriginal, gave a delightful charm to this evening. He left the house\r\nwith Rastignac, who, as they drove home, asked him how he liked the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\n“Michel did well to love her,” replied d’Arthez; “she is, indeed, an\r\nextraordinary woman.”\r\n\r\n“Very extraordinary,” replied Rastignac, dryly. “By the tone of your\r\nvoice I should judge you were in love with her already. You will be in\r\nher house within three days; and I am too old a denizen of Paris not to\r\nknow what will be the upshot of that. Well, my dear Daniel, I do entreat\r\nyou not to allow yourself to be drawn into any confusion of interests,\r\nso to speak. Love the princess if you feel any love for her in your\r\nheart, but keep an eye on your fortune. She has never taken or asked a\r\npenny from any man on earth, she is far too much of a d’Uxelles and a\r\nCadignan for that; but, to my knowledge, she has not only spent her\r\nown fortune, which was very considerable, but she has made others\r\nwaste millions. How? why? by what means? No one knows; she doesn’t\r\nknow herself. I myself saw her swallow up, some thirteen years ago, the\r\nentire fortune of a charming young fellow, and that of an old notary, in\r\ntwenty months.”\r\n\r\n“Thirteen years ago!” exclaimed d’Arthez,--“why, how old is she now?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you see, at dinner,” replied Rastignac, laughing, “her son, the\r\nDuc de Maufrigneuse. That young man is nineteen years old; nineteen and\r\nseventeen make--”\r\n\r\n“Thirty-six!” cried the amazed author. “I gave her twenty.”\r\n\r\n“She’ll accept them,” said Rastignac; “but don’t be uneasy, she will\r\nalways be twenty to you. You are about to enter the most fantastic\r\nof worlds. Good-night, here you are at home,” said the baron, as they\r\nentered the rue de Bellefond, where d’Arthez lived in a pretty little\r\nhouse of his own. “We shall meet at Mademoiselle des Touches’s in the\r\ncourse of the week.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE PRINCESS GOES TO WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nD’Arthez allowed love to enter his heart after the manner of my Uncle\r\nToby, without making the slightest resistance; he proceeded by adoration\r\nwithout criticism, and by exclusive admiration. The princess, that noble\r\ncreature, one of the most remarkable creations of our monstrous Paris,\r\nwhere all things are possible, good as well as evil, became--whatever\r\nvulgarity the course of time may have given to the expression--the angel\r\nof his dreams. To fully understand the sudden transformation of this\r\nillustrious author, it is necessary to realize the simplicity that\r\nconstant work and solitude leave in the heart; all that love--reduced\r\nto a mere need, and now repugnant, beside an ignoble woman--excites of\r\nregret and longings for diviner sentiments in the higher regions of the\r\nsoul. D’Arthez was, indeed, the child, the boy that Madame de Cadignan\r\nhad recognized. An illumination something like his own had taken place\r\nin the beautiful Diane. At last she had met that superior man whom all\r\nwomen desire and seek, if only to make a plaything of him,--that power\r\nwhich they consent to obey, if only for the pleasure of subduing it;\r\nat last she had found the grandeurs of the intellect united with\r\nthe simplicity of a heart all new to love; and she saw, with untold\r\nhappiness, that these merits were contained in a form that pleased her.\r\nShe thought d’Arthez handsome, and perhaps he was. Though he had reached\r\nthe age of gravity (for he was now thirty-eight), he still preserved\r\na flower of youth, due to the sober and ascetic life which he had led.\r\nLike all men of sedentary habits, and statesmen, he had acquired\r\na certainly reasonable embonpoint. When very young, he bore some\r\nresemblance to Bonaparte; and the likeness still continued, as much as a\r\nman with black eyes and thick, dark hair could resemble a sovereign\r\nwith blue eyes and scanty, chestnut hair. But whatever there once was of\r\nardent and noble ambition in the great author’s eyes had been somewhat\r\nquenched by successes. The thoughts with which that brow once teemed had\r\nflowered; the lines of the hollow face were filling out. Ease now spread\r\nits golden tints where, in youth, poverty had laid the yellow tones\r\nof the class of temperament whose forces band together to support a\r\ncrushing and long-continued struggle. If you observe carefully the noble\r\nfaces of ancient philosophers, you will always find those deviations\r\nfrom the type of a perfect human face which show the characteristic to\r\nwhich each countenance owes its originality, chastened by the habit of\r\nmeditation, and by the calmness necessary for intellectual labor. The\r\nmost irregular features, like those of Socrates, for instance, become,\r\nafter a time, expressive of an almost divine serenity.\r\n\r\nTo the noble simplicity which characterized his head, d’Arthez added a\r\nnaive expression, the naturalness of a child, and a touching kindliness.\r\nHe did not have that politeness tinged with insincerity with which, in\r\nsociety, the best-bred persons and the most amiable assume qualities in\r\nwhich they are often lacking, leaving those they have thus duped wounded\r\nand distressed. He might, indeed, fail to observe certain rules of\r\nsocial life, owing to his isolated mode of living; but he never shocked\r\nthe sensibilities, and therefore this perfume of savagery made the\r\npeculiar affability of a man of great talent the more agreeable; such\r\nmen know how to leave their superiority in their studies, and come\r\ndown to the social level, lending their backs, like Henry IV., to the\r\nchildren’s leap-frog, and their minds to fools.\r\n\r\nIf d’Arthez did not brace himself against the spell which the princess\r\nhad cast about him, neither did she herself argue the matter in her own\r\nmind, on returning home. It was settled for her. She loved with all her\r\nknowledge and all her ignorance. If she questioned herself at all, it\r\nwas to ask whether she deserved so great a happiness, and what she had\r\ndone that Heaven should send her such an angel. She wanted to be worthy\r\nof that love, to perpetuate it, to make it her own forever, and to\r\ngently end her career of frivolity in the paradise she now foresaw. As\r\nfor coquetting, quibbling, resisting, she never once thought of it. She\r\nwas thinking of something very different!--of the grandeur of men of\r\ngenius, and the certainty which her heart divined that they would never\r\nsubject the woman they chose to ordinary laws.\r\n\r\nHere begins one of those unseen comedies, played in the secret regions\r\nof the consciousness between two beings of whom one will be the dupe of\r\nthe other, though it keeps on this side of wickedness; one of those\r\ndark and comic dramas to which that of _Tartuffe_ is mere child’s\r\nplay,--dramas that do not enter the scenic domain, although they are\r\nnatural, conceivable, and even justifiable by necessity; dramas which\r\nmay be characterized as not vice, only the other side of it.\r\n\r\nThe princess began by sending for d’Arthez’s books, of which she had\r\nnever, as yet, read a single word, although she had managed to maintain\r\na twenty minutes’ eulogism and discussion of them without a blunder. She\r\nnow read them all. Then she wanted to compare these books with the best\r\nthat contemporary literature had produced. By the time d’Arthez came to\r\nsee her she was having an indigestion of mind. Expecting this visit, she\r\nhad daily made a toilet of what may be called the superior order; that\r\nis, a toilet which expresses an idea, and makes it accepted by the eye\r\nwithout the owner of the eye knowing why or wherefore. She presented an\r\nharmonious combination of shades of gray, a sort of semi-mourning, full\r\nof graceful renunciation,--the garments of a woman who holds to life\r\nonly through a few natural ties,--her child, for instance,--but who is\r\nweary of life. Those garments bore witness to an elegant disgust, not\r\nreaching, however, as far as suicide; no, she would live out her days in\r\nthese earthly galleys.\r\n\r\nShe received d’Arthez as a woman who expected him, and as if he had\r\nalready been to see her a hundred times; she did him the honor to treat\r\nhim like an old acquaintance, and she put him at his ease by pointing\r\nto a seat on a sofa, while she finished a note she was then writing. The\r\nconversation began in a commonplace manner: the weather, the ministry,\r\nde Marsay’s illness, the hopes of the legitimists. D’Arthez was an\r\nabsolutist; the princess could not be ignorant of the opinions of a\r\nman who sat in the Chamber among the fifteen or twenty persons who\r\nrepresented the legitimist party; she found means to tell him how she\r\nhad fooled de Marsay to the top of his bent, then, by an easy transition\r\nto the royal family and to “Madame,” and the devotion of the Prince\r\nde Cadignan to their service, she drew d’Arthez’s attention to the\r\nprince:--\r\n\r\n“There is this to be said for him: he loved his masters, and was\r\nfaithful to them. His public character consoles me for the sufferings\r\nhis private life has inflicted upon me--Have you never remarked,” she\r\nwent on, cleverly leaving the prince aside, “you who observe so much,\r\nthat men have two natures: one of their homes, their wives, their\r\nprivate lives,--this is their true self; here no mask, no dissimulation;\r\nthey do not give themselves the trouble to disguise a feeling; they are\r\nwhat they ARE, and it is often horrible! The other man is for others,\r\nfor the world, for salons; the court, the sovereign, the public often\r\nsee them grand, and noble, and generous, embroidered with virtues,\r\nadorned with fine language, full of admirable qualities. What a horrible\r\njest it is!--and the world is surprised, sometimes, at the caustic smile\r\nof certain women, at their air of superiority to their husbands, and\r\ntheir indifference--”\r\n\r\nShe let her hand fall along the arm of her chair, without ending her\r\nsentence, but the gesture admirably completed the speech. She saw\r\nd’Arthez watching her flexible figure, gracefully bending in the depths\r\nof her easy-chair, noting the folds of her gown, and the pretty little\r\nruffle which sported on her breast,--one of those audacities of the\r\ntoilet that are suited only to slender waists,--and she resumed the\r\nthread of her thoughts as if she were speaking to herself:--\r\n\r\n“But I will say no more. You writers have ended by making ridiculous\r\nall women who think they are misunderstood, or ill-mated, and who try to\r\nmake themselves dramatically interesting,--attempts which seem to me, I\r\nmust say, intolerably vulgar. There are but two things for women in that\r\nplight to do,--yield, and all is over; resist, and amuse themselves; in\r\neither case they should keep silence. It is true that I neither yielded\r\nwholly, nor resisted wholly; but, perhaps, that was only the more reason\r\nwhy I should be silent. What folly for women to complain! If they\r\nhave not proved the stronger, they have failed in sense, in tact, in\r\ncapacity, and they deserve their fate. Are they not queens in France?\r\nThey can play with you as they like, when they like, and as much as they\r\nlike.” Here she danced her vinaigrette with an airy movement of feminine\r\nimpertinence and mocking gayety. “I have often heard miserable little\r\nspecimens of my sex regretting that they were women, wishing they were\r\nmen; I have always regarded them with pity. If I had to choose, I should\r\nstill elect to be a woman. A fine pleasure, indeed, to owe one’s triumph\r\nto force, and to all those powers which you give yourselves by the\r\nlaws you make! But to see you at our feet, saying and doing foolish\r\nthings,--ah! it is an intoxicating pleasure to feel within our souls\r\nthat weakness triumphs! But when we triumph, we ought to keep silence,\r\nunder pain of losing our empire. Beaten, a woman’s pride should gag her.\r\nThe slave’s silence alarms the master.”\r\n\r\nThis chatter was uttered in a voice so softly sarcastic, so dainty, and\r\nwith such coquettish motions of the head, that d’Arthez, to whom this\r\nstyle of woman was totally unknown, sat before her exactly like a\r\npartridge charmed by a setter.\r\n\r\n“I entreat you, madame,” he said, at last, “to tell me how it was\r\npossible that a man could make you suffer? Be assured that where, as you\r\nsay, other women are common and vulgar, you can only seem distinguished;\r\nyour manner of saying things would make a cook-book interesting.”\r\n\r\n“You go fast in friendship,” she said, in a grave voice which made\r\nd’Arthez extremely uneasy.\r\n\r\nThe conversation changed; the hour was late, and the poor man of genius\r\nwent away contrite for having seemed curious, and for wounding the\r\nsensitive heart of that rare woman who had so strangely suffered. As\r\nfor her, she had passed her life in amusing herself with men, and was\r\nanother Don Juan in female attire, with this difference: she would\r\ncertainly not have invited the Commander to supper, and would have got\r\nthe better of any statue.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to continue this tale without saying a word about\r\nthe Prince de Cadignan, better known under the name of the Duc de\r\nMaufrigneuse, otherwise the spice of the princess’s confidences would\r\nbe lost, and strangers would not understand the Parisian comedy she was\r\nabout to play for her man of genius.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Maufrigneuse, like a true son of the old Prince de Cadignan,\r\nis a tall, lean man, of elegant shape, very graceful, a sayer of witty\r\nthings, colonel by the grace of God, and a good soldier by accident;\r\nbrave as a Pole, which means without sense or discernment, and hiding\r\nthe emptiness of his mind under the jargon of good society. After the\r\nage of thirty-six he was forced to be as absolutely indifferent to\r\nthe fair sex as his master Charles X., punished, like that master, for\r\nhaving pleased it too well. For eighteen years the idol of the faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain, he had, like other heirs of great families led a\r\ndissipated life, spent solely on pleasure. His father, ruined by the\r\nrevolution, had somewhat recovered his position on the return of the\r\nBourbons, as governor of a royal domain, with salary and perquisites;\r\nbut this uncertain fortune the old prince spent, as it came, in keeping\r\nup the traditions of a great seigneur before the revolution; so that\r\nwhen the law of indemnity was passed, the sums he received were all\r\nswallowed up in the luxury he displayed in his vast hotel.\r\n\r\nThe old prince died some little time before the revolution of July aged\r\neighty-seven. He had ruined his wife, and had long been on bad terms\r\nwith the Duc de Navarreins, who had married his daughter for a first\r\nwife, and to whom he very reluctantly rendered his accounts. The Duc\r\nde Maufrigneuse, early in life, had had relations with the Duchesse\r\nd’Uxelles. About the year 1814, when Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was\r\nforty-six years of age, the duchess, pitying his poverty, and seeing\r\nthat he stood very well at court, gave him her daughter Diane, then in\r\nher seventeenth year, and possessing, in her own right, some fifty or\r\nsixty thousand francs a year, not counting her future expectations.\r\nMademoiselle d’Uxelles thus became a duchess, and, as her mother very\r\nwell knew, she enjoyed the utmost liberty. The duke, after obtaining\r\nthe unexpected happiness of an heir, left his wife entirely to her\r\nown devices, and went off to amuse himself in the various garrisons of\r\nFrance, returning occasionally to Paris, where he made debts which his\r\nfather paid. He professed the most entire conjugal indulgence, always\r\ngiving the duchess a week’s warning of his return; he was adored by\r\nhis regiment, beloved by the Dauphin, an adroit courtier, somewhat of\r\na gambler, and totally devoid of affectation. Having succeeded to his\r\nfather’s office as governor of one of the royal domains, he managed to\r\nplease the two kings, Louis XVIII. and Charles X., which proves he made\r\nthe most of his nonentity; and even the liberals liked him; but his\r\nconduct and life were covered with the finest varnish; language, noble\r\nmanners, and deportment were brought by him to a state of perfection.\r\nBut, as the old prince said, it was impossible for him to continue the\r\ntraditions of the Cadignans, who were all well known to have ruined\r\ntheir wives, for the duchess was running through her property on her own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThese particulars were so well understood in the court circles and\r\nin the faubourg Saint-Germain, that during the last five years of\r\nthe Restoration they were considered ancient history, and any one who\r\nmentioned them would have been laughed at. Women never spoke of the\r\ncharming duke without praising him; he was excellent, they said, to his\r\nwife; could a man be better? He had left her the entire disposal of her\r\nown property, and had always defended her on every occasion. It is\r\ntrue that, whether from pride, kindliness, or chivalry, Monsieur de\r\nMaufrigneuse had saved the duchess under various circumstances which\r\nmight have ruined other women, in spite of Diane’s surroundings, and\r\nthe influence of her mother and that of the Duc de Navarreins, her\r\nfather-in-law, and her husband’s aunt.\r\n\r\nFor several ensuing days the princess revealed herself to d’Arthez as\r\nremarkable for her knowledge of literature. She discussed with perfect\r\nfearlessness the most difficult questions, thanks to her daily and\r\nnightly reading, pursued with an intrepidity worthy of the highest\r\npraise. D’Arthez, amazed, and incapable of suspecting that Diane\r\nd’Uxelles merely repeated at night that which she read in the morning\r\n(as some writers do), regarded her as a most superior woman. These\r\nconversations, however, led away from Diane’s object, and she tried to\r\nget back to the region of confidences from which d’Arthez had prudently\r\nretired after her coquettish rebuff; but it was not as easy as she\r\nexpected to bring back a man of his nature who had once been startled\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a month of literary campaigning and the finest platonic\r\ndiscourses, d’Arthez grew bolder, and arrived every day at three\r\no’clock. He retired at six, and returned at nine, to remain until\r\nmidnight, or one in the morning, with the regularity of an ardent and\r\nimpatient lover. The princess was always dressed with more or less\r\nstudied elegance at the hour when d’Arthez presented himself. This\r\nmutual fidelity, the care they each took of their appearance, in fact,\r\nall about them expressed sentiments that neither dared avow, for the\r\nprincess discerned very plainly that the great child with whom she had\r\nto do shrank from the combat as much as she desired it. Nevertheless\r\nd’Arthez put into his mute declarations a respectful awe which was\r\ninfinitely pleasing to her. Both felt, every day, all the more united\r\nbecause nothing acknowledged or definite checked the course of their\r\nideas, as occurs between lovers when there are formal demands on one\r\nside, and sincere or coquettish refusals on the other.\r\n\r\nLike all men younger than their actual age, d’Arthez was a prey to those\r\nagitating irresolutions which are caused by the force of desires and\r\nthe terror of displeasing,--a situation which a young woman does not\r\ncomprehend when she shares it, but which the princess had too often\r\ndeliberately produced not to enjoy its pleasures. In fact, Diane enjoyed\r\nthese delightful juvenilities all the more keenly because she knew that\r\nshe could put an end to them at any moment. She was like a great artist\r\ndelighting in the vague, undecided lines of his sketch, knowing well\r\nthat in a moment of inspiration he can complete the masterpiece still\r\nwaiting to come to birth. Many a time, seeing d’Arthez on the point\r\nof advancing, she enjoyed stopping him short, with an imposing air and\r\nmanner. She drove back the hidden storms of that still young heart,\r\nraised them again, and stilled them with a look, holding out her hand\r\nto be kissed, or saying some trifling insignificant words in a tender\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThese manoeuvres, planned in cold blood, but enchantingly executed,\r\ncarved her image deeper and deeper on the soul of that great writer and\r\nthinker whom she revelled in making childlike, confiding, simple, and\r\nalmost silly beside her. And yet she had moments of repulsion against\r\nher own act, moments in which she could not help admiring the grandeur\r\nof such simplicity. This game of choicest coquetry attached her,\r\ninsensibly, to her slave. At last, however, Diane grew impatient with\r\nan Epictetus of love; and when she thought she had trained him to the\r\nutmost credulity, she set to work to tie a thicker bandage still over\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE CONFESSION OF A PRETTY WOMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening Daniel found the princess thoughtful, one elbow resting on\r\na little table, her beautiful blond head bathed in light from the lamp.\r\nShe was toying with a letter which lay on the table-cloth. When d’Arthez\r\nhad seen the paper distinctly, she folded it up, and stuck it in her\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked d’Arthez; “you seem distressed.”\r\n\r\n“I have received a letter from Monsieur de Cadignan,” she replied.\r\n“However great the wrongs he has done me, I cannot help thinking of his\r\nexile--without family, without son--from his native land.”\r\n\r\nThese words, said in a soulful voice, betrayed angelic sensibility.\r\nD’Arthez was deeply moved. The curiosity of the lover became, so to\r\nspeak, a psychological and literary curiosity. He wanted to know the\r\nheight that woman had attained, and what were the injuries she thus\r\nforgave; he longed to know how these women of the world, taxed with\r\nfrivolity, cold-heartedness, and egotism, could be such angels.\r\nRemembering how the princess had already repulsed him when he first\r\ntried to read that celestial heart, his voice, and he himself, trembled\r\nas he took the transparent, slender hand of the beautiful Diane with its\r\ncurving finger-tips, and said,--\r\n\r\n“Are we now such friends that you will tell me what you have suffered?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said, breathing forth the syllable like the most mellifluous\r\nnote that Tulou’s flute had ever sighed.\r\n\r\nThen she fell into a revery, and her eyes were veiled. Daniel remained\r\nin a state of anxious expectation, impressed with the solemnity of the\r\noccasion. His poetic imagination made him see, as it were, clouds slowly\r\ndispersing and disclosing to him the sanctuary where the wounded lamb\r\nwas kneeling at the divine feet.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he said, in a soft, still voice.\r\n\r\nDiane looked at the tender petitioner; then she lowered her eyes slowly,\r\ndropping their lids with a movement of noble modesty. None but a\r\nmonster would have been capable of imagining hypocrisy in the graceful\r\nundulation of the neck with which the princess again lifted her charming\r\nhead, to look once more into the eager eyes of that great man.\r\n\r\n“Can I? ought I?” she murmured, with a gesture of hesitation, gazing at\r\nd’Arthez with a sublime expression of dreamy tenderness. “Men have so\r\nlittle faith in things of this kind; they think themselves so little\r\nbound to be discreet!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! if you distrust me, why am I here?” cried d’Arthez.\r\n\r\n“Oh, friend!” she said, giving to the exclamation the grace of an\r\ninvoluntary avowal, “when a woman attaches herself for life, think you\r\nshe calculates? It is not question of refusal (how could I refuse you\r\nanything?), but the idea of what you may think of me if I speak. I would\r\nwillingly confide to you the strange position in which I am at my age;\r\nbut what would you think of a woman who could reveal the secret wounds\r\nof her married life? Turenne kept his word to robbers; do I not owe to\r\nmy torturers the honor of a Turenne?”\r\n\r\n“Have you passed your word to say nothing?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Cadignan did not think it necessary to bind me to\r\nsecrecy--You are asking more than my soul! Tyrant! you want me to bury\r\nmy honor itself in your breast,” she said, casting upon d’Arthez a\r\nlook, by which she gave more value to her coming confidence than to her\r\npersonal self.\r\n\r\n“You must think me a very ordinary man, if you fear any evil, no matter\r\nwhat, from me,” he said, with ill-concealed bitterness.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me, friend,” she replied, taking his hand in hers caressingly,\r\nand letting her fingers wander gently over it. “I know your worth. You\r\nhave related to me your whole life; it is noble, it is beautiful, it is\r\nsublime, and worthy of your name; perhaps, in return, I owe you mine.\r\nBut I fear to lower myself in your eyes by relating secrets which\r\nare not wholly mine. How can you believe--you, a man of solitude and\r\npoesy--the horrors of social life? Ah! you little think when you invent\r\nyour dramas that they are far surpassed by those that are played in\r\nfamilies apparently united. You are wholly ignorant of certain gilded\r\nsorrows.”\r\n\r\n“I know all!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“No, you know nothing.”\r\n\r\nD’Arthez felt like a man lost on the Alps of a dark night, who sees,\r\nat the first gleam of dawn, a precipice at his feet. He looked at the\r\nprincess with a bewildered air, and felt a cold chill running down his\r\nback. Diane thought for a moment that her man of genius was a weakling,\r\nbut a flash from his eyes reassured her.\r\n\r\n“You have become to me almost my judge,” she said, with a desperate air.\r\n“I must speak now, in virtue of the right that all calumniated beings\r\nhave to show their innocence. I have been, I am still (if a poor recluse\r\nforced by the world to renounce the world is still remembered) accused\r\nof such light conduct, and so many evil things, that it may be allowed\r\nme to find in one strong heart a haven from which I cannot be driven.\r\nHitherto I have always considered self-justification an insult to\r\ninnocence; and that is why I have disdained to defend myself. Besides,\r\nto whom could I appeal? Such cruel things can be confided to none but\r\nGod or to one who seems to us very near Him--a priest, or another self.\r\nWell! I do know this, if my secrets are not as safe there,” she said,\r\nlaying her hand on d’Arthez’s heart, “as they are here” (pressing the\r\nupper end of her busk beneath her fingers), “then you are not the grand\r\nd’Arthez I think you--I shall have been deceived.”\r\n\r\nA tear moistened d’Arthez’s eyes, and Diane drank it in with a side\r\nlook, which, however, gave no motion either to the pupils or the lids of\r\nher eyes. It was quick and neat, like the action of a cat pouncing on a\r\nmouse.\r\n\r\nD’Arthez, for the first time, after sixty days of protocols, ventured\r\nto take that warm and perfumed hand, and press it to his lips with a\r\nlong-drawn kiss, extending from the wrist to the tip of the fingers,\r\nwhich made the princess augur well of literature. She thought to herself\r\nthat men of genius must know how to love with more perfection than\r\nconceited fops, men of the world, diplomatists, and even soldiers,\r\nalthough such beings have nothing else to do. She was a connoisseur, and\r\nknew very well that the capacity for love reveals itself chiefly in mere\r\nnothings. A woman well informed in such matters can read her future in\r\na simple gesture; just as Cuvier could say from the fragment of a bone:\r\nThis belonged to an animal of such or such dimensions, with or without\r\nhorns, carnivorous, herbivorous, amphibious, etc., age, so many thousand\r\nyears. Sure now of finding in d’Arthez as much imagination in love as\r\nthere was in his written style, she thought it wise to bring him up at\r\nonce to the highest pitch of passion and belief.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew her hand hastily, with a magnificent movement full of\r\nvaried emotions. If she had said in words: “Stop, or I shall die,” she\r\ncould not have spoken more plainly. She remained for a moment with\r\nher eyes in d’Arthez’s eyes, expressing in that one glance happiness,\r\nprudery, fear, confidence, languor, a vague longing, and virgin modesty.\r\nShe was twenty years old! but remember, she had prepared for this hour\r\nof comic falsehood by the choicest art of dress; she was there in her\r\narmchair like a flower, ready to blossom at the first kiss of sunshine.\r\nTrue or false, she intoxicated Daniel.\r\n\r\nIt if is permissible to risk a personal opinion we must avow that it\r\nwould be delightful to be thus deceived for a good long time. Certainly\r\nTalma on the stage was often above and beyond nature, but the Princesse\r\nde Cadignan is the greatest true comedian of our day. Nothing was\r\nwanting to this woman but an attentive audience. Unfortunately, at\r\nepochs perturbed by political storms, women disappear like water-lilies\r\nwhich need a cloudless sky and balmy zephyrs to spread their bloom to\r\nour enraptured eyes.\r\n\r\nThe hour had come; Diane was now to entangle that great man in the\r\ninextricable meshes of a romance carefully prepared, to which he was\r\nfated to listen as the neophyte of early Christian times listened to the\r\nepistles of an apostle.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” began Diane, “my mother, who still lives at Uxelles,\r\nmarried me in 1814, when I was seventeen years old (you see how old I am\r\nnow!) to Monsieur de Maufrigneuse, not out of affection for me, but out\r\nof regard for him. She discharged her debt to the only man she had ever\r\nloved, for the happiness she had once received from him. Oh! you need\r\nnot be astonished at so horrible a conspiracy; it frequently takes\r\nplace. Many women are more lovers than mothers, though the majority\r\nare more mothers than wives. The two sentiments, love and motherhood,\r\ndeveloped as they are by our manners and customs, often struggle\r\ntogether in the hearts of women; one or other must succumb when they\r\nare not of equal strength; when they are, they produce some exceptional\r\nwomen, the glory of our sex. A man of your genius must surely comprehend\r\nmany things that bewilder fools but are none the less true; indeed I may\r\ngo further and call them justifiable through difference of characters,\r\ntemperaments, attachments, situations. I, for example, at this moment,\r\nafter twenty years of misfortunes, of deceptions, of calumnies endured,\r\nand weary days and hollow pleasures, is it not natural that I should\r\nincline to fall at the feet of a man who would love me sincerely and\r\nforever? And yet, the world would condemn me. But twenty years of\r\nsuffering might well excuse a few brief years which may still remain to\r\nme of youth given to a sacred and real love. This will not happen. I am\r\nnot so rash as to sacrifice my hopes of heaven. I have borne the burden\r\nand heat of the day, I shall finish my course and win my recompense.”\r\n\r\n“Angel!” thought d’Arthez.\r\n\r\n“After all, I have never blamed my mother; she knew little of me.\r\nMothers who lead a life like that of the Duchesse d’Uxelles keep their\r\nchildren at a distance. I saw and knew nothing of the world until my\r\nmarriage. You can judge of my innocence! I knew nothing; I was incapable\r\nof understanding the causes of my marriage. I had a fine fortune; sixty\r\nthousand francs a year in forests, which the Revolution overlooked (or\r\nhad not been able to sell) in the Nivernais, with the noble chateau of\r\nd’Anzy. Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was steeped in debt. Later I learned\r\nwhat it was to have debts, but then I was too utterly ignorant of life\r\nto suspect my position; the money saved out of my fortune went to pacify\r\nmy husband’s creditors. Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was forty-eight years\r\nof age when I married him; but those years were like military campaigns,\r\nthey ought to count for twice what they were. Ah! what a life I led for\r\nten years! If any one had known the suffering of this poor, calumniated\r\nlittle woman! To be watched by a mother jealous of her daughter!\r\nHeavens! You who make dramas, you will never invent anything as direful\r\nas that. Ordinarily, according to the little that I know of literature,\r\na drama is a suite of actions, speeches, movements which hurry to a\r\ncatastrophe; but what I speak of was a catastrophe in action. It was an\r\navalanche fallen in the morning and falling again at night only to\r\nfall again the next day. I am cold now as I speak to you of that cavern\r\nwithout an opening, cold, sombre, in which I lived. I, poor little thing\r\nthat I was! brought up in a convent like a mystic rose, knowing nothing\r\nof marriage, developing late, I was happy at first; I enjoyed the\r\ngoodwill and harmony of our family. The birth of my poor boy, who is\r\nall me--you must have been struck by the likeness? my hair, my eyes, the\r\nshape of my face, my mouth, my smile, my teeth!--well, his birth was a\r\nrelief to me; my thoughts were diverted by the first joys of maternity\r\nfrom my husband, who gave me no pleasure and did nothing for me that\r\nwas kind or amiable; those joys were all the keener because I knew no\r\nothers. It had been so often rung into my ears that a mother should\r\nrespect herself. Besides, a young girl loves to play the mother. I was\r\nso proud of my flower--for Georges was beautiful, a miracle, I thought!\r\nI saw and thought of nothing but my son, I lived with my son. I never\r\nlet his nurse dress or undress him. Such cares, so wearing to mothers\r\nwho have a regiment of children, were all my pleasure. But after three\r\nor four years, as I was not an actual fool, light came to my eyes in\r\nspite of the pains taken to blindfold me. Can you see me at that\r\nfinal awakening, in 1819? The drama of ‘The Brothers at enmity’ is a\r\nrose-water tragedy beside that of a mother and daughter placed as we\r\nthen were. But I braved them all, my mother, my husband, the world,\r\nby public coquetries which society talked of,--and heaven knows how it\r\ntalked! You can see, my friend, how the men with whom I was accused of\r\nfolly were to me the dagger with which to stab my enemies. Thinking only\r\nof my vengeance, I did not see or feel the wounds I was inflicting on\r\nmyself. Innocent as a child, I was thought a wicked woman, the worst of\r\nwomen, and I knew nothing of it! The world is very foolish, very blind,\r\nvery ignorant; it can penetrate no secrets but those which amuse it and\r\nserve its malice: noble things, great things, it puts its hand before\r\nits eyes to avoid seeing. But, as I look back, it seems to me that I had\r\nan attitude and aspect of indignant innocence, with movements of pride,\r\nwhich a great painter would have recognized. I must have enlivened many\r\na ball with my tempests of anger and disdain. Lost poesy! such sublime\r\npoems are only made in the glowing indignation which seizes us at\r\ntwenty. Later, we are wrathful no longer, we are too weary, vice no\r\nlonger amazes us, we are cowards, we fear. But then--oh! I kept a great\r\npace! For all that I played the silliest personage in the world; I was\r\ncharged with crimes by which I never benefited. But I had such pleasure\r\nin compromising myself. That was my revenge! Ah! I have played many\r\nchildish tricks! I went to Italy with a thoughtless youth, whom I\r\ncrushed when he spoke to me of love, but later, when I herd that he was\r\ncompromised on my account (he had committed a forgery to get money) I\r\nrushed to save him. My mother and husband kept me almost without means;\r\nbut, this time, I went to the king. Louis XVIII., that man without a\r\nheart, was touched; he gave me a hundred thousand francs from his privy\r\npurse. The Marquis d’Esgrignon--you must have seen him in society for he\r\nended by making a rich marriage--was saved from the abyss into which he\r\nhad plunged for my sake. That adventure, caused by my own folly, led me\r\nto reflect. I saw that I myself was the first victim of my vengeance.\r\nMy mother, who knew I was too proud, too d’Uxelles, to conduct\r\nmyself really ill, began to see the harm that she had done me and was\r\nfrightened by it. She was then fifty-two years of age; she left Paris\r\nand went to live at Uxelles. There she expiates her wrong-doing by a\r\nlife of devotion and expresses the utmost affection for me. After her\r\ndeparture I was face to face, alone, with Monsieur de Maufrigneuse. Oh!\r\nmy friend, you men can never know what an old man of gallantry can be.\r\nWhat a home is that of a man accustomed to the adulation of women of the\r\nworld, when he finds neither incense nor censer in his own house! dead\r\nto all! and yet, perhaps for that very reason, jealous. I wished--when\r\nMonsieur de Maufrigneuse was wholly mine--I wished to be a good wife,\r\nbut I found myself repulsed with the harshness of a soured spirit by\r\na man who treated me like a child and took pleasure in humiliating\r\nmy self-respect at every turn, in crushing me under the scorn of his\r\nexperience, and in convicting me of total ignorance. He wounded me on\r\nall occasions. He did everything to make me detest him and to give me\r\nthe right to betray him; but I was still the dupe of my own hope and of\r\nmy desire to do right through several years. Shall I tell you the cruel\r\nsaying that drove me to further follies? ‘The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse\r\nhas gone back to her husband,’ said the world. ‘Bah! it is always a\r\ntriumph to bring the dead to life; it is all she can now do,’ replied my\r\nbest friend, a relation, she, at whose house I met you--”\r\n\r\n“Madame d’Espard!” cried Daniel, with a gesture of horror.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I have forgiven her. Besides, it was very witty; and I have myself\r\nmade just as cruel epigrams on other poor women as innocent as myself.”\r\n\r\nD’Arthez again kissed the hand of that saintly woman who, having hacked\r\nher mother in pieces, and turned the Prince de Cadignan into an Othello,\r\nnow proceeded to accuse herself in order to appear in the eyes of that\r\ninnocent great man as immaculate as the silliest or the wisest of women\r\ndesire to seem at all costs to their lovers.\r\n\r\n“You will readily understand, my friend, that I returned to society for\r\nthe purpose of excitement and I may say of notoriety. I felt that I must\r\nconquer my independence. I led a life of dissipation. To divert my mind,\r\nto forget my real life in fictitious enjoyments I was gay, I shone, I\r\ngave fetes, I played the princess, and I ran in debt. At home I could\r\nforget myself in the sleep of weariness, able to rise the next day gay,\r\nand frivolous for the world; but in that sad struggle to escape my real\r\nlife I wasted my fortune. The revolution of 1830 came; it came at the\r\nvery moment when I had met, at the end of that _Arabian Nights’_ life, a\r\npure and sacred love which (I desire to be honest) I had longed to know.\r\nWas it not natural in a woman whose heart, repressed by many causes and\r\naccidents, was awakening at an age when a woman feels herself cheated\r\nif she has never known, like the women she sees about her, a happy love?\r\nAh! why was Michel Chrestien so respectful? Why did he not seek to meet\r\nme? There again was another mockery! But what of that? in falling, I\r\nhave lost everything; I have no illusions left; I had tasted of all\r\nthings except the one fruit for which I have no longer teeth. Yes, I\r\nfound myself disenchanted with the world at the very moment when I was\r\nforced to leave it. Providential, was it not? like all those strange\r\ninsensibilities which prepare us for death” (she made a gesture full\r\nof pious unction). “All things served me then,” she continued; “the\r\ndisasters of the monarchy and its ruin helped me to bury myself. My son\r\nconsoles me for much. Maternal love takes the place of all frustrated\r\nfeelings. The world is surprised at my retirement, but to me it has\r\nbrought peace. Ah! if you knew how happy the poor creature before you is\r\nin this little place. In sacrificing all to my son I forget to think of\r\njoys of which I am and ever must be ignorant. Yes, hope has flown, I\r\nnow fear everything; no doubt I should repulse the truest sentiment,\r\nthe purest and most veritable love, in memory of the deceptions and the\r\nmiseries of my life. It is all horrible, is it not? and yet, what I have\r\ntold you is the history of many women.”\r\n\r\nThe last few words were said in a tone of easy pleasantry which recalled\r\nthe presence of the woman of the world. D’Arthez was dumbfounded. In his\r\neyes convicts sent to the galleys for murder, or aggravated robbery, or\r\nfor putting a wrong name to checks, were saints compared to the men and\r\nwomen of society. This atrocious elegy, forged in the arsenal of lies,\r\nand steeped in the waters of the Parisian Styx, had been poured into his\r\nears with the inimitable accent of truth. The grave author contemplated\r\nfor a moment that adorable woman lying back in her easy-chair, her two\r\nhands pendant from its arms like dewdrops from a rose-leaf, overcome\r\nby her own revelation, living over again the sorrows of her life as she\r\ntold them--in short an angel of melancholy.\r\n\r\n“And judge,” she cried, suddenly lifting herself with a spring and\r\nraising her hand, while lightning flashed from eyes where twenty chaste\r\nyears shone--“judge of the impression the love of a man like Michel\r\nmust have made upon me. But by some irony of fate--or was it the hand of\r\nGod?--well, he died; died in saving the life of, whom do you suppose? of\r\nMonsieur de Cadignan. Are you now surprised to find me thoughtful?”\r\n\r\nThis was the last drop; poor d’Arthez could bear no more. He fell upon\r\nhis knees, and laid his head on Diane’s hand, weeping soft tears such\r\nas the angels shed,--if angels weep. As Daniel was in that bent posture,\r\nMadame de Cadignan could safely let a malicious smile of triumph flicker\r\non her lips, a smile such as the monkeys wear after playing a sly\r\ntrick--if monkeys smile.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I have him,” thought she; and, indeed, she had him fast.\r\n\r\n“But you are--” he said, raising his fine head and looking at her with\r\neyes of love.\r\n\r\n“Virgin and martyr,” she replied, smiling at the commonness of that\r\nhackneyed expression, but giving it a freshness of meaning by her smile,\r\nso full of painful gayety. “If I laugh,” she continued, “it is that I am\r\nthinking of that princess whom the world thinks it knows, that Duchesse\r\nde Maufrigneuse to whom it gives as lovers de Marsay, that infamous de\r\nTrailles (a political cutthroat), and that little fool of a d’Esgrignon,\r\nand Rastignac, Rubempre, ambassadors, ministers, Russian generals,\r\nheaven knows who! all Europe! They have gossiped about that album which\r\nI ordered made, believing that those who admired me were my friends. Ah!\r\nit is frightful! I wonder that I allow a man at my feet! Despise them\r\nall, THAT should be my religion.”\r\n\r\nShe rose and went to the window with a gait and bearing magnificent in\r\nmotifs.\r\n\r\nD’Arthez remained on the low seat to which he had returned not daring\r\nto follow the princess; but he looked at her; he heard her blowing her\r\nnose. Was there ever a princess who blew her nose? but Diane attempted\r\nthe impossible to convey an idea of her sensibility. D’Arthez believed\r\nhis angel was in tears; he rushed to her side, took her round the waist,\r\nand pressed her to his heart.\r\n\r\n“No, no, leave me!” she murmured in a feeble voice. “I have too many\r\ndoubts to be good for anything. To reconcile me with life is a task\r\nbeyond the powers of any man.”\r\n\r\n“Diane! I will love you for your whole lost life.”\r\n\r\n“No; don’t speak to me thus,” she answered. “At this moment I tremble, I\r\nam ashamed as though I had committed the greatest sins.”\r\n\r\nShe was now entirely restored to the innocence of little girls, and\r\nyet her bearing was august, grand, noble as that of a queen. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the effect of these manoeuvres, so clever that\r\nthey acted like the purest truth on a soul as fresh and honest as that\r\nof d’Arthez. The great author remained dumb with admiration, passive\r\nbeside her in the recess of that window awaiting a word, while the\r\nprincess awaited a kiss; but she was far too sacred to him for that.\r\nFeeling cold, the princess returned to her easy-chair; her feet were\r\nfrozen.\r\n\r\n“It will take a long time,” she said to herself, looking at Daniel’s\r\nnoble brow and head.\r\n\r\n“Is this a woman?” thought that profound observer of human nature. “How\r\nought I to treat her?”\r\n\r\nUntil two o’clock in the morning they spent their time in saying to each\r\nother the silly things that women of genius, like the princess, know how\r\nto make adorable. Diane pretended to be too worn, too old, too faded;\r\nD’Arthez proved to her (facts of which she was well convinced) that her\r\nskin was the most delicate, the softest to the touch, the whitest to the\r\neye, the most fragrant; she was young and in her bloom, how could she\r\nthink otherwise? Thus they disputed, beauty by beauty, detail by detail\r\nwith many: “Oh! do you think so?”--“You are beside yourself!”--“It is\r\nhope, it is fancy!”--“You will soon see me as I am.--I am almost forty\r\nyears of age. Can a man love so old a woman?”\r\n\r\nD’Arthez responded with impetuous and school-boy eloquence, larded with\r\nexaggerated epithets. When the princess heard this wise and witty writer\r\ntalking the nonsense of an amorous sub-lieutenant she listened with an\r\nabsorbed air and much sensibility; but she laughed in her sleeve.\r\n\r\nWhen d’Arthez was in the street, he asked himself whether he might not\r\nhave been rather less respectful. He went over in memory those strange\r\nconfidences--which have, naturally, been much abridged here, for they\r\nneeded a volume to convey their mellifluous abundance and the graces\r\nwhich accompanied them. The retrospective perspicacity of this man, so\r\nnatural, so profound, was baffled by the candor of that tale and its\r\npoignancy, and by the tones of the princess.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” he said to himself, being unable to sleep, “there are such\r\ndramas as that in society. Society covers great horrors with the flowers\r\nof its elegance, the embroidery of its gossip, the wit of its lies. We\r\nwriters invent no more than the truth. Poor Diane! Michel had penetrated\r\nthat enigma; he said that beneath her covering of ice there lay\r\nvolcanoes! Bianchon and Rastignac were right; when a man can join the\r\ngrandeurs of the ideal and the enjoyments of human passion in loving\r\na woman of perfect manners, of intellect, of delicacy, it must be\r\nhappiness beyond words.”\r\n\r\nSo thinking, he sounded the love that was in him and found it infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. A TRIAL OF FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, about two in the afternoon, Madame d’Espard, who had seen\r\nand heard nothing of the princess for more than a month, went to see her\r\nunder the impulse of extreme curiosity. Nothing was ever more amusing\r\nof its kind than the conversation of these two crafty adders during the\r\nfirst half-hour of this visit.\r\n\r\nDiane d’Uxelles cautiously avoided, as she would the wearing of a yellow\r\ngown, all mention of d’Arthez. The marquise circled round and round that\r\ntopic like a Bedouin round a caravan. Diane amused herself; the marquise\r\nfumed. Diane waited; she intended to utilize her friend and use her in\r\nthe chase. Of these two women, both so celebrated in the social world,\r\none was far stronger than the other. The princess rose by a head\r\nabove the marquise, and the marquise was inwardly conscious of that\r\nsuperiority. In this, perhaps, lay the secret of their intimacy. The\r\nweaker of the two crouched low in her false attachment, watching for the\r\nhour, long awaited by feeble beings, of springing at the throat of the\r\nstronger and leaving the mark of a joyful bite. Diane saw clear; but the\r\nworld was the dupe of the wile caresses of the two friends.\r\n\r\nThe instant that the princess perceived a direct question on the lips of\r\nher friend, she said:--\r\n\r\n“Ah! dearest, I owe you a most complete, immense, infinite, celestial\r\nhappiness.”\r\n\r\n“What can you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Have you forgotten what we ruminated three months ago in the little\r\ngarden, sitting on a bench in the sun, under the jasmine? Ah! there are\r\nnone but men of genius who know how to love! I apply to my grand Daniel\r\nd’Arthez the Duke of Alba’s saying to Catherine de’ Medici: ‘The head of\r\na single salmon is worth all the frogs in the world.’”\r\n\r\n“I am not surprised that I no longer see you,” said Madame d’Espard.\r\n\r\n“Promise me, if you meet him, not to say to him one word about me, my\r\nangel,” said the princess, taking her friend’s hand. “I am happy, oh!\r\nhappy beyond all expression; but you know that in society a word, a mere\r\njest can do much harm. One speech can kill, for they put such venom into\r\na single sentence! Ah! if you knew how I long that you might meet with\r\na love like this! Yes, it is a sweet, a precious triumph for women like\r\nourselves to end our woman’s life in this way; to rest in an ardent,\r\npure, devoted, complete and absolute love; above all, when we have\r\nsought it long.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask me to be faithful to my dearest friend?” said Madame\r\nd’Espard. “Do you think me capable of playing you some villainous\r\ntrick?”\r\n\r\n“When a woman possesses such a treasure the fear of losing it is so\r\nstrong that it naturally inspires a feeling of terror. I am absurd, I\r\nknow; forgive me, dear.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later the marquise departed; as she watched her go the\r\nprincess said to herself:--\r\n\r\n“How she will pluck me! But to save her the trouble of trying to get\r\nDaniel away from here I’ll send him to her.”\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock, or a few moments after, d’Arthez arrived. In the midst\r\nof some interesting topic on which he was discoursing eloquently, the\r\nprincess suddenly cut him short by laying her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my dear friend,” she said, interrupting him, “but I fear\r\nI may forget a thing which seems a mere trifle but may be of great\r\nimportance. You have not set foot in Madame d’Espard’s salon since the\r\never-blessed day when I met you there. Pray go at once; not for your\r\nsake, nor by way of politeness, but for me. You may already have made\r\nher an enemy of mine, if by chance she has discovered that since her\r\ndinner you have scarcely left my house. Besides, my friend, I don’t like\r\nto see you dropping your connection with society, and neglecting your\r\noccupations and your work. I should again be strangely calumniated. What\r\nwould the world say? That I held you in leading-strings, absorbed you,\r\nfeared comparisons, and clung to my conquest knowing it to be my last!\r\nWho will know that you are my friend, my only friend? If you love me\r\nindeed, as you say you love me, you will make the world believe that\r\nwe are purely and simply brother and sister--Go on with what you were\r\nsaying.”\r\n\r\nIn his armor of tenderness, riveted by the knowledge of so many splendid\r\nvirtues, d’Arthez obeyed this behest on the following day and went\r\nto see Madame d’Espard, who received him with charming coquetry. The\r\nmarquise took very good care not to say a single word to him about the\r\nprincess, but she asked him to dinner on a coming day.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion d’Arthez found a numerous company. The marquise\r\nhad invited Rastignac, Blondet, the Marquis d’Ajuda-Pinto, Maxime de\r\nTrailles, the Marquis d’Esgrignon, the two brothers Vandenesse, du\r\nTillet, one of the richest bankers in Paris, the Baron de Nucingen,\r\nRaoul Nathan, Lady Dudley, two very treacherous secretaries of embassies\r\nand the Chevalier d’Espard, the wiliest person in this assemblage and\r\nthe chief instigator of his sister-in-law’s policy.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was well under way, Maxime de Trailles turned to d’Arthez\r\nand said smiling:--\r\n\r\n“You see a great deal, don’t you, of the Princesse de Cadignan?”\r\n\r\nTo this question d’Arthez responded by curtly nodding his head. Maxime\r\nde Trailles was a “bravo” of the social order, without faith or law,\r\ncapable of everything, ruining the women who trusted him, compelling\r\nthem to pawn their diamonds to give him money, but covering this conduct\r\nwith a brilliant varnish; a man of charming manners and satanic mind.\r\nHe inspired all who knew him with equal contempt and fear; but as no\r\none was bold enough to show him any sentiments but those of the utmost\r\ncourtesy he saw nothing of this public opinion, or else he accepted and\r\nshared the general dissimulation. He owed to the Comte de Marsay the\r\ngreatest degree of elevation to which he could attain. De Marsay,\r\nwhose knowledge of Maxime was of long-standing, judged him capable of\r\nfulfilling certain secret and diplomatic functions which he confided to\r\nhim and of which de Trailles acquitted himself admirably. D’Arthez had\r\nfor some time past mingled sufficiently in political matters to know the\r\nman for what he was, and he alone had sufficient strength and height of\r\ncharacter to express aloud what others thought or said in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Is it for her that you neglect the Chamber?” asked Baron de Nucingen in\r\nhis German accent.\r\n\r\n“Ah! the princess is one of the most dangerous women a man can have\r\nanything to do with. I owe to her the miseries of my marriage,”\r\n exclaimed the Marquis d’Esgrignon.\r\n\r\n“Dangerous?” said Madame d’Espard. “Don’t speak so of my nearest friend.\r\nI have never seen or known anything in the princess that did not seem to\r\ncome from the noblest sentiments.”\r\n\r\n“Let the marquis say what he thinks,” cried Rastignac. “When a man has\r\nbeen thrown by a fine horse he thinks it has vices and he sells it.”\r\n\r\nPiqued by these words, the Marquis d’Esgrignon looked at d’Arthez and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is not, I trust, on such terms with the princess that we\r\ncannot speak freely of her?”\r\n\r\nD’Arthez kept silence. D’Esgrignon, who was not wanting in cleverness,\r\nreplied to Rastignac’s speech with an apologetic portrait of the\r\nprincess, which put the whole table in good humor. As the jest was\r\nextremely obscure to d’Arthez he leaned towards his neighbor, Madame de\r\nMontcornet, and asked her, in a whisper, what it meant.\r\n\r\n“Excepting yourself--judging by the excellent opinion you seem to have\r\nof the princess--all the other guests are said to have been in her good\r\ngraces.”\r\n\r\n“I can assure you that such an accusation is absolutely false,” said\r\nDaniel.\r\n\r\n“And yet, here is Monsieur d’Esgrignon of an old family of Alencon, who\r\ncompletely ruined himself for her some twelve years ago, and, if all is\r\ntrue, came very near going to the scaffold.”\r\n\r\n“I know the particulars of that affair,” said d’Arthez. “Madame de\r\nCadignan went to Alencon to save Monsieur d’Esgrignon from a trial\r\nbefore the court of assizes; and this is how he rewards her to-day!”\r\n\r\nMadame de Montcornet looked at d’Arthez with a surprise and curiosity\r\nthat were almost stupid, then she turned her eyes on Madame d’Espard\r\nwith a look which seemed to say: “He is bewitched!”\r\n\r\nDuring this short conversation Madame de Cadignan was protected by\r\nMadame d’Espard, whose protection was like that of the lightning-rod\r\nwhich draws the flash. When d’Arthez returned to the general\r\nconversation Maxime de Trailles was saying:--\r\n\r\n“With Diane, depravity is not an effect but a cause; perhaps she owes\r\nthat cause to her exquisite nature; she doesn’t invent, she makes no\r\neffort, she offers you the choicest refinements as the inspiration of\r\na spontaneous and naive love; and it is absolutely impossible not to\r\nbelieve her.”\r\n\r\nThis speech, which seemed to have been prepared for a man of d’Arthez’s\r\nstamp, was so tremendous an arraignment that the company appeared to\r\naccept it as a conclusion. No one said more; the princess was crushed.\r\nD’Arthez looked straight at de Trailles and then at d’Esgrignon with a\r\nsarcastic air, and said:--\r\n\r\n“The greatest fault of that woman is that she has followed in the wake\r\nof men. She squanders patrimonies as they do; she drives her lovers to\r\nusurers; she pockets ‘dots’; she ruins orphans; she inspires, possibly\r\nshe commits, crimes, but--”\r\n\r\nNever had the two men, whom d’Arthez was chiefly addressing, listened\r\nto such plain talk. At that BUT the whole table was startled, every one\r\npaused, fork in air, their eyes fixed alternately on the brave author\r\nand on the assailants of the princess, awaiting the conclusion of that\r\nhorrible silence.\r\n\r\n“_But_,” said d’Arthez, with sarcastic airiness, “Madame la Princesse\r\nde Cadignan has one advantage over men: when they have put themselves in\r\ndanger for her sake, she saves them, and says no harm of any one. Among\r\nthe multitude, why shouldn’t there be one woman who amuses herself with\r\nmen as men amuse themselves with women? Why not allow the fair sex to\r\ntake, from time to time, its revenge?”\r\n\r\n“Genius is stronger than wit,” said Blondet to Nathan.\r\n\r\nThis broadside of sarcasms was in fact the discharge of a battery of\r\ncannons against a platoon of musketry. When coffee was served, Blondet\r\nand Nathan went up to d’Arthez with an eagerness no one else dared to\r\nimitate, so unable were the rest of the company to show the admiration\r\nhis conduct inspired from the fear of making two powerful enemies.\r\n\r\n“This is not the first time we have seen that your character equals your\r\ntalent in grandeur,” said Blondet. “You behaved just now more like a\r\ndemi-god than a man. Not to have been carried away by your heart or\r\nyour imagination, not to have taken up the defence of a beloved woman--a\r\nfault they were enticing you to commit, because it would have given\r\nthose men of society eaten up with jealousy of your literary fame a\r\ntriumph over you--ah! give me leave to say you have attained the height\r\nof private statesmanship.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you are a statesman,” said Nathan. “It is as clever as it is\r\ndifficult to avenge a woman without defending her.”\r\n\r\n“The princess is one of those heroines of the legitimist party, and\r\nit is the duty of all men of honor to protect her quand meme,” replied\r\nd’Arthez, coldly. “What she has done for the cause of her masters would\r\nexcuse all follies.”\r\n\r\n“He keeps his own counsel!” said Nathan to Blondet.\r\n\r\n“Precisely as if the princess were worth it,” said Rastignac, joining\r\nthe other two.\r\n\r\nD’Arthez went to the princess, who was awaiting him with the keenest\r\nanxiety. The result of this experiment, which Diane had herself brought\r\nabout, might be fatal to her. For the first time in her life this woman\r\nsuffered in her heart. She knew not what she should do in case d’Arthez\r\nbelieved the world which spoke the truth, instead of believing her who\r\nlied; for never had so noble a nature, so complete a man, a soul so\r\npure, a conscience so ingenuous come beneath her hand. Though she had\r\ntold him cruel lies she was driven to do so by the desire of knowing a\r\ntrue love. That love--she felt it dawning in her heart; yes, she loved\r\nd’Arthez; and now she was condemned forever to deceive him! She must\r\nhenceforth remain to him the actress who had played that comedy to blind\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nWhen she heard Daniel’s step in the dining-room a violent commotion, a\r\nshudder which reached to her very vitals came over her. That convulsion,\r\nnever felt during all the years of her adventurous existence, told her\r\nthat she had staked her happiness on this issue. Her eyes, gazing\r\ninto space, took in the whole of d’Arthez’s person; their light poured\r\nthrough his flesh, she read his soul; suspicion had not so much as\r\ntouched him with its bat’s-wing. The terrible emotion of that fear then\r\ncame to its reaction; joy almost stifled her; for there is no human\r\nbeing who is not more able to endure grief than to bear extreme\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\n“Daniel, they have calumniated me, and you have avenged me!” she cried,\r\nrising, and opening her arms to him.\r\n\r\nIn the profound amazement caused by these words, the roots of which were\r\nutterly unknown to him, Daniel allowed his hand to be taken between her\r\nbeautiful hands, as the princess kissed him sacredly on the forehead.\r\n\r\n“But,” he said, “how could you know--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! illustrious ninny! do you not see that I love you fondly?”\r\n\r\nSince that day nothing has been said of the Princess de Cadignan, nor\r\nof d’Arthez. The princess has inherited some fortune from her mother and\r\nshe spends all her summers in a villa on the lake of Geneva, where the\r\ngreat writer joins her. She returns to Paris for a few months in winter.\r\nD’Arthez is never seen except in the Chamber. His writings are becoming\r\nexceedingly rare. Is this a conclusion? Yes, for people of sense; no,\r\nfor persons who want to know everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM\r\n\r\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\r\n\r\n     Ajuda-Pinto, Marquis Miguel d’\r\n       Father Goriot\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan’s Life\r\n       Beatrix\r\n\r\n     Arthez, Daniel d’\r\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\r\n       Letters of Two Brides\r\n       The Member for Arcis\r\n\r\n     Bianchon, Horace\r\n       Father Goriot\r\n       The Atheist’s Mass\r\n       Cesar Birotteau\r\n       The Commission in Lunacy\r\n       Lost Illusions\r\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\r\n       A Bachelor’s Establishment\r\n       The Government Clerks\r\n       Pierrette\r\n       A Study of Woman\r\n       Scenes from a Courtesan’s Life\r\n       Honorine\r\n       The Seamy Side of History\r\n       The Magic Skin\r\n       A Second Home\r\n       A Prince of Bohemia\r\n       Letters of Two Brides\r\n       The Muse of the Department\r\n       The Imaginary Mistress\r\n       The Middle Classes\r\n       Cousin Betty\r\n       The Country Parson\r\n     In addition, M.
