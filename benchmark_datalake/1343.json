THE RABOURDIN HOUSEHOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Paris, where men of thought and study bear a certain likeness to one\r\nanother, living as they do in a common centre, you must have met with\r\nseveral resembling Monsieur Rabourdin, whose acquaintance we are about\r\nto make at a moment when he is head of a bureau in one of our most\r\nimportant ministries. At this period he was forty years old, with gray\r\nhair of so pleasing a shade that women might at a pinch fall in love\r\nwith it for it softened a somewhat melancholy countenance, blue eyes\r\nfull of fire, a skin that was still fair, though rather ruddy and\r\ntouched here and there with strong red marks; a forehead and nose a la\r\nLouis XV., a serious mouth, a tall figure, thin, or perhaps wasted, like\r\nthat of a man just recovering from illness, and finally, a bearing that\r\nwas midway between the indolence of a mere idler and the thoughtfulness\r\nof a busy man. If this portrait serves to depict his character, a sketch\r\nof this man’s dress will bring it still further into relief. Rabourdin\r\nwore habitually a blue surcoat, a white cravat, a waistcoat crossed a la\r\nRobespierre, black trousers without straps, gray silk stockings and low\r\nshoes. Well-shaved, and with his stomach warmed by a cup of coffee, he\r\nleft home at eight in the morning with the regularity of clock-work,\r\nalways passing along the same streets on his way to the ministry: so\r\nneat was he, so formal, so starched that he might have been taken for an\r\nEnglishman on the road to his embassy.\r\n\r\nFrom these general signs you will readily discern a family man,\r\nharassed by vexations in his own household, worried by annoyances at the\r\nministry, yet philosopher enough to take life as he found it; an honest\r\nman, loving his country and serving it, not concealing from himself the\r\nobstacles in the way of those who seek to do right; prudent, because he\r\nknew men; exquisitely courteous with women, of whom he asked nothing,--a\r\nman full of acquirements, affable with his inferiors, holding his equals\r\nat great distance, and dignified towards his superiors. At the epoch of\r\nwhich we write, you would have noticed in him the coldly resigned air of\r\none who has buried the illusions of his youth and renounced every secret\r\nambition; you would have recognized a discouraged, but not disgusted\r\nman, one who still clings to his first projects,--more perhaps to\r\nemploy his faculties than in the hope of a doubtful success. He was not\r\ndecorated with any order, and always accused himself of weakness\r\nfor having worn that of the Fleur-de-lis in the early days of the\r\nRestoration.\r\n\r\nThe life of this man was marked by certain mysterious peculiarities.\r\nHe had never known his father; his mother, a woman to whom luxury was\r\neverything, always elegantly dressed, always on pleasure bent, whose\r\nbeauty seemed to him miraculous and whom he very seldom saw, left\r\nhim little at her death; but she had given him that too common and\r\nincomplete education which produces so much ambition and so little\r\nability. A few days before his mother’s death, when he was just sixteen,\r\nhe left the Lycee Napoleon to enter as supernumerary a government\r\noffice, where an unknown protector had provided him with a place.\r\nAt twenty-two years of age Rabourdin became under-head-clerk; at\r\ntwenty-five, head-clerk, or, as it was termed, head of the bureau. From\r\nthat day the hand that assisted the young man to start in life was never\r\nfelt again in his career, except as to a single circumstance; it led\r\nhim, poor and friendless, to the house of a Monsieur Leprince, formerly\r\nan auctioneer, a widower said to be extremely rich, and father of\r\nan only daughter. Xavier Rabourdin fell desperately in love with\r\nMademoiselle Celestine Leprince, then seventeen years of age, who had\r\nall the matrimonial claims of a dowry of two hundred thousand francs.\r\nCarefully educated by an artistic mother, who transmitted her own\r\ntalents to her daughter, this young lady was fitted to attract\r\ndistinguished men. Tall, handsome, and finely-formed, she was a good\r\nmusician, drew and painted, spoke several languages, and even knew\r\nsomething of science,--a dangerous advantage, which requires a woman\r\nto avoid carefully all appearance of pedantry. Blinded by mistaken\r\ntenderness, the mother gave the daughter false ideas as to her probable\r\nfuture; to the maternal eyes a duke or an ambassador, a marshal of\r\nFrance or a minister of State, could alone give her Celestine her due\r\nplace in society. The young lady had, moreover, the manners, language,\r\nand habits of the great world. Her dress was richer and more elegant\r\nthan was suitable for an unmarried girl; a husband could give her\r\nnothing more than she now had, except happiness. Besides all such\r\nindulgences, the foolish spoiling of the mother, who died a year after\r\nthe girl’s marriage, made a husband’s task all the more difficult.\r\nWhat coolness and composure of mind were needed to rule such a woman!\r\nCommonplace suitors held back in fear. Xavier Rabourdin, without parents\r\nand without fortune other than his situation under government, was\r\nproposed to Celestine by her father. She resisted for a long time;\r\nnot that she had any personal objection to her suitor, who was young,\r\nhandsome, and much in love, but she shrank from the plain name of Madame\r\nRabourdin. Monsieur Leprince assured his daughter that Xavier was of\r\nthe stock that statesmen came of. Celestine answered that a man named\r\nRabourdin would never be anything under the government of the Bourbons,\r\netc. Forced back to his intrenchments, the father made the serious\r\nmistake of telling his daughter that her future husband was certain of\r\nbecoming Rabourdin “de something or other” before he reached the age\r\nof admission to the Chamber. Xavier was soon to be appointed Master of\r\npetitions, and general-secretary at his ministry. From these lower steps\r\nof the ladder the young man would certainly rise to the higher ranks of\r\nthe administration, possessed of a fortune and a name bequeathed to him\r\nin a certain will of which he, Monsieur Leprince, was cognizant. On this\r\nthe marriage took place.\r\n\r\nRabourdin and his wife believed in the mysterious protector to whom\r\nthe auctioneer alluded. Led away by such hopes and by the natural\r\nextravagance of happy love, Monsieur and Madame Rabourdin spent nearly\r\none hundred thousand francs of their capital in the first five years\r\nof married life. By the end of this time Celestine, alarmed at the\r\nnon-advancement of her husband, insisted on investing the remaining\r\nhundred thousand francs of her dowry in landed property, which returned\r\nonly a slender income; but her future inheritance from her father would\r\namply repay all present privations with perfect comfort and ease of\r\nlife. When the worthy auctioneer saw his son-in-law disappointed of the\r\nhopes they had placed on the nameless protector, he tried, for the\r\nsake of his daughter, to repair the secret loss by risking part of his\r\nfortune in a speculation which had favourable chances of success. But\r\nthe poor man became involved in one of the liquidations of the house of\r\nNucingen, and died of grief, leaving nothing behind him but a dozen fine\r\npictures which adorned his daughter’s salon, and a few old-fashioned\r\npieces of furniture, which she put in the garret.\r\n\r\nEight years of fruitless expectation made Madame Rabourdin at last\r\nunderstand that the paternal protector of her husband must have died,\r\nand that his will, if it ever existed, was lost or destroyed. Two years\r\nbefore her father’s death the place of chief of division, which became\r\nvacant, was given, over her husband’s head, to a certain Monsieur de la\r\nBillardiere, related to a deputy of the Right who was made minister in\r\n1823. It was enough to drive Rabourdin out of the service; but how could\r\nhe give up his salary of eight thousand francs and perquisites, when\r\nthey constituted three fourths of his income and his household was\r\naccustomed to spend them? Besides, if he had patience for a few more\r\nyears he would then be entitled to a pension. What a fall was this for\r\na woman whose high expectations at the opening of her life were more or\r\nless warranted, and one who was admitted on all sides to be a superior\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nMadame Rabourdin had justified the expectations formed of Mademoiselle\r\nLeprince; she possessed the elements of that apparent superiority which\r\npleases the world; her liberal education enabled her to speak to every\r\none in his or her own language; her talents were real; she showed an\r\nindependent and elevated mind; her conversation charmed as much by its\r\nvariety and ease as by the oddness and originality of her ideas. Such\r\nqualities, useful and appropriate in a sovereign or an ambassadress,\r\nwere of little service to a household compelled to jog in the common\r\nround. Those who have the gift of speaking well desire an audience;\r\nthey like to talk, even if they sometimes weary others. To satisfy the\r\nrequirements of her mind Madame Rabourdin took a weekly reception-day\r\nand went a great deal into society to obtain the consideration her\r\nself-love was accustomed to enjoy. Those who know Parisian life will\r\nreadily understand how a woman of her temperament suffered, and was\r\nmartyrized at heart by the scantiness of her pecuniary means. No matter\r\nwhat foolish declarations people make about money, they one and all, if\r\nthey live in Paris, must grovel before accounts, do homage to figures,\r\nand kiss the forked hoof of the golden calf. What a problem was hers!\r\ntwelve thousand francs a year to defray the costs of a household\r\nconsisting of father, mother, two children, a chambermaid and cook,\r\nliving on the second floor of a house in the rue Duphot, in an apartment\r\ncosting two thousand francs a year. Deduct the dress and the carriage of\r\nMadame before you estimate the gross expenses of the family, for dress\r\nprecedes everything; then see what remains for the education of the\r\nchildren (a girl of eight and a boy of nine, whose maintenance must\r\ncost at least two thousand francs besides) and you will find that Madame\r\nRabourdin could barely afford to give her husband thirty francs a month.\r\nThat is the position of half the husbands in Paris, under penalty of\r\nbeing thought monsters.\r\n\r\nThus it was that this woman who believed herself destined to shine in\r\nthe world was condemned to use her mind and her faculties in a sordid\r\nstruggle, fighting hand to hand with an account-book. Already, terrible\r\nsacrifice of pride! she had dismissed her man-servant, not long after\r\nthe death of her father. Most women grow weary of this daily struggle;\r\nthey complain but they usually end by giving up to fate and taking what\r\ncomes to them; Celestine’s ambition, far from lessening, only increased\r\nthrough difficulties, and led her, when she found she could not conquer\r\nthem, to sweep them aside. To her mind this complicated tangle of the\r\naffairs of life was a Gordian knot impossible to untie and which\r\ngenius ought to cut. Far from accepting the pettiness of middle-class\r\nexistence, she was angry at the delay which kept the great things of\r\nlife from her grasp,--blaming fate as deceptive. Celestine sincerely\r\nbelieved herself a superior woman. Perhaps she was right; perhaps she\r\nwould have been great under great circumstances; perhaps she was not in\r\nher right place. Let us remember there are as many varieties of woman as\r\nthere are of man, all of which society fashions to meet its needs. Now\r\nin the social order, as in Nature’s order, there are more young shoots\r\nthan there are trees, more spawn than full-grown fish, and many great\r\ncapacities (Athanase Granson, for instance) which die withered for want\r\nof moisture, like seeds on stony ground. There are, unquestionably,\r\nhousehold women, accomplished women, ornamental women, women who are\r\nexclusively wives, or mothers, or sweethearts, women purely spiritual\r\nor purely material; just as there are soldiers, artists, artisans,\r\nmathematicians, poets, merchants, men who understand money, or\r\nagriculture, or government, and nothing else. Besides all this, the\r\neccentricity of events leads to endless cross-purposes; many are called\r\nand few are chosen is the law of earth as of heaven. Madame Rabourdin\r\nconceived herself fully capable of directing a statesman, inspiring an\r\nartist, helping an inventor and pushing his interests, or of devoting\r\nher powers to the financial politics of a Nucingen, and playing a\r\nbrilliant part in the great world. Perhaps she was only endeavouring to\r\nexcuse to her own mind a hatred for the laundry lists and the duty of\r\noverlooking the housekeeping bills, together with the petty economies\r\nand cares of a small establishment. She was superior only in those\r\nthings where it gave her pleasure to be so. Feeling as keenly as she\r\ndid the thorns of a position which can only be likened to that of\r\nSaint-Laurence on his grid-iron, is it any wonder that she sometimes\r\ncried out? So, in her paroxysms of thwarted ambition, in the moments\r\nwhen her wounded vanity gave her terrible shooting pains, Celestine\r\nturned upon Xavier Rabourdin. Was it not her husband’s duty to give her\r\na suitable position in the world? If she were a man she would have had\r\nthe energy to make a rapid fortune for the sake of rendering an adored\r\nwife happy! She reproached him for being too honest a man. In the mouth\r\nof some women this accusation is a charge of imbecility. She sketched\r\nout for him certain brilliant plans in which she took no account of the\r\nhindrances imposed by men and things; then, like all women under the\r\ninfluence of vehement feeling, she became in thought as Machiavellian\r\nas Gondreville, and more unprincipled than Maxime de Trailles. At such\r\ntimes Celestine’s mind took a wide range, and she imagined herself at\r\nthe summit of her ideas.\r\n\r\nWhen these fine visions first began Rabourdin, who saw the practical\r\nside, was cool. Celestine, much grieved, thought her husband\r\nnarrow-minded, timid, unsympathetic; and she acquired, insensibly, a\r\nwholly false opinion of the companion of her life. In the first place,\r\nshe often extinguished him by the brilliancy of her arguments. Her ideas\r\ncame to her in flashes, and she sometimes stopped him short when he\r\nbegan an explanation, because she did not choose to lose the slightest\r\nsparkle of her own mind. From the earliest days of their marriage\r\nCelestine, feeling herself beloved and admired by her husband, treated\r\nhim without ceremony; she put herself above conjugal laws and the\r\nrules of private courtesy by expecting love to pardon all her little\r\nwrong-doings; and, as she never in any way corrected herself, she was\r\nalways in the ascendant. In such a situation the man holds to the wife\r\nvery much the position of a child to a teacher when the latter cannot or\r\nwill not recognize that the mind he has ruled in childhood is becoming\r\nmature. Like Madame de Stael, who exclaimed in a room full of people,\r\naddressing, as we may say, a greater man than herself, “Do you know you\r\nhave really said something very profound!” Madame Rabourdin said of\r\nher husband: “He certainly has a good deal of sense at times.” Her\r\ndisparaging opinion of him gradually appeared in her behavior through\r\nalmost imperceptible motions. Her attitude and manners expressed a want\r\nof respect. Without being aware of it she injured her husband in the\r\neyes of others; for in all countries society, before making up its mind\r\nabout a man, listens for what his wife thinks of him, and obtains from\r\nher what the Genevese term “pre-advice.”\r\n\r\nWhen Rabourdin became aware of the mistakes which love had led him to\r\ncommit it was too late,--the groove had been cut; he suffered and\r\nwas silent. Like other men in whom sentiments and ideas are of equal\r\nstrength, whose souls are noble and their brains well balanced, he was\r\nthe defender of his wife before the tribunal of his own judgment; he\r\ntold himself that nature doomed her to a disappointed life through his\r\nfault; HIS; she was like a thoroughbred English horse, a racer harnessed\r\nto a cart full of stones; she it was who suffered; and he blamed\r\nhimself. His wife, by dint of constant repetition, had inoculated him\r\nwith her own belief in herself. Ideas are contagious in a household; the\r\nninth thermidor, like so many other portentous events, was the result\r\nof female influence. Thus, goaded by Celestine’s ambition, Rabourdin had\r\nlong considered the means of satisfying it, though he hid his hopes, so\r\nas to spare her the tortures of uncertainty. The man was firmly resolved\r\nto make his way in the administration by bringing a strong light to bear\r\nupon it. He intended to bring about one of those revolutions which send\r\na man to the head of either one party or another in society; but being\r\nincapable of so doing in his own interests, he merely pondered useful\r\nthoughts and dreamed of triumphs won for his country by noble means. His\r\nideas were both generous and ambitious; few officials have not\r\nconceived the like; but among officials as among artists there are more\r\nmiscarriages than births; which is tantamount to Buffon’s saying that\r\n“Genius is patience.”\r\n\r\nPlaced in a position where he could study French administration and\r\nobserve its mechanism, Rabourdin worked in the circle where his thought\r\nrevolved, which, we may remark parenthetically, is the secret of much\r\nhuman accomplishment; and his labor culminated finally in the invention\r\nof a new system for the Civil Service of government. Knowing the people\r\nwith whom he had to do, he maintained the machine as it then worked, so\r\nit still works and will continue to work; for everybody fears to remodel\r\nit, though no one, according to Rabourdin, ought to be unwilling to\r\nsimplify it. In his opinion, the problem to be resolved lay in a better\r\nuse of the same forces. His plan, in its simplest form, was to revise\r\ntaxation and lower it in a way that should not diminish the revenues of\r\nthe State, and to obtain, from a budget equal to the budgets which now\r\nexcite such rabid discussion, results that should be two-fold greater\r\nthan the present results. Long practical experience had taught Rabourdin\r\nthat perfection is brought about in all things by changes in the\r\ndirection of simplicity. To economize is to simplify. To simplify\r\nmeans to suppress unnecessary machinery; removals naturally follow.\r\nHis system, therefore, depended on the weeding out of officials and the\r\nestablishment of a new order of administrative offices. No doubt the\r\nhatred which all reformers incur takes its rise here. Removals required\r\nby this perfecting process, always ill-understood, threaten the\r\nwell-being of those on whom a change in their condition is thus forced.\r\nWhat rendered Rabourdin really great was that he was able to restrain\r\nthe enthusiasm that possesses all reformers, and to patiently seek out a\r\nslow evolving medium for all changes so as to avoid shocks, leaving time\r\nand experience to prove the excellence of each reform. The grandeur of\r\nthe result anticipated might make us doubt its possibility if we lose\r\nsight of this essential point in our rapid analysis of his system. It\r\nis, therefore, not unimportant to show through his self-communings,\r\nhowever incomplete they might be, the point of view from which he looked\r\nat the administrative horizon. This tale, which is evolved from the very\r\nheart of the Civil Service, may also serve to show some of the evils of\r\nour present social customs.\r\n\r\nXavier Rabourdin, deeply impressed by the trials and poverty which he\r\nwitnessed in the lives of the government clerks, endeavored to ascertain\r\nthe cause of their growing deterioration. He found it in those petty\r\npartial revolutions, the eddies, as it were, of the storm of 1789,\r\nwhich the historians of great social movements neglect to inquire into,\r\nalthough as a matter of fact it is they which have made our manners and\r\ncustoms what they are now.\r\n\r\nFormerly, under the monarchy, the bureaucratic armies did not exist.\r\nThe clerks, few in number, were under the orders of a prime minister who\r\ncommunicated with the sovereign; thus they directly served the king. The\r\nsuperiors of these zealous servants were simply called head-clerks. In\r\nthose branches of administration which the king did not himself direct,\r\nsuch for instance as the “fermes” (the public domains throughout\r\nthe country on which a revenue was levied), the clerks were to their\r\nsuperior what the clerks of a business-house are to their employer; they\r\nlearned a science which would one day advance them to prosperity. Thus,\r\nall points of the circumference were fastened to the centre and derived\r\ntheir life from it. The result was devotion and confidence. Since 1789\r\nthe State, call it the Nation if you like, has replaced the sovereign.\r\nInstead of looking directly to the chief magistrate of this nation,\r\nthe clerks have become, in spite of our fine patriotic ideas, the\r\nsubsidiaries of the government; their superiors are blown about by the\r\nwinds of a power called “the administration,” and do not know from\r\nday to day where they may be on the morrow. As the routine of public\r\nbusiness must go on, a certain number of indispensable clerks are kept\r\nin their places, though they hold these places on sufferance, anxious as\r\nthey are to retain them. Bureaucracy, a gigantic power set in motion by\r\ndwarfs, was generated in this way. Though Napoleon, by subordinating\r\nall things and all men to his will, retarded for a time the influence of\r\nbureaucracy (that ponderous curtain hung between the service to be\r\ndone and the man who orders it), it was permanently organized under\r\nthe constitutional government, which was, inevitably, the friend of\r\nall mediocrities, the lover of authentic documents and accounts, and as\r\nmeddlesome as an old tradeswoman. Delighted to see the various ministers\r\nconstantly struggling against the four hundred petty minds of the\r\nElected of the Chamber, with their ten or a dozen ambitious and\r\ndishonest leaders, the Civil Service officials hastened to make\r\nthemselves essential to the warfare by adding their quota of assistance\r\nunder the form of written action; they created a power of inertia and\r\nnamed it “Report.” Let us explain the Report.\r\n\r\nWhen the kings of France took to themselves ministers, which first\r\nhappened under Louis XV., they made them render reports on all important\r\nquestions, instead of holding, as formerly, grand councils of state with\r\nthe nobles. Under the constitutional government, the ministers of the\r\nvarious departments were insensibly led by their bureaus to imitate this\r\npractice of kings. Their time being taken up in defending themselves\r\nbefore the two Chambers and the court, they let themselves be guided by\r\nthe leading-strings of the Report. Nothing important was ever brought\r\nbefore the government that a minister did not say, even when the case\r\nwas urgent, “I have called for a report.” The Report thus became, both\r\nas to the matter concerned and for the minister himself, the same as\r\na report to the Chamber of Deputies on a question of laws,--namely, a\r\ndisquisition in which the reasons for and against are stated with more\r\nor less partiality. No real result is attained; the minister, like\r\nthe Chamber, is fully as well prepared before as after the report is\r\nrendered. A determination, in whatever matter, is reached in an instant.\r\nDo what we will, the moment comes when the decision must be made. The\r\ngreater the array of reasons for and against, the less sound will be\r\nthe judgment. The finest things of which France can boast have been\r\naccomplished without reports and where decisions were prompt and\r\nspontaneous. The dominant law of a statesman is to apply precise formula\r\nto all cases, after the manner of judges and physicians.\r\n\r\nRabourdin, who said to himself: “A minister should have decision, should\r\nknow public affairs, and direct their course,” saw “Report” rampant\r\nthroughout France, from the colonel to the marshal, from the commissary\r\nof police to the king, from the prefects to the ministers of state,\r\nfrom the Chamber to the courts. After 1818 everything was discussed,\r\ncompared, and weighed, either in speech or writing; public business\r\ntook a literary form. France went to ruin in spite of this array of\r\ndocuments; dissertations stood in place of action; a million of reports\r\nwere written every year; bureaucracy was enthroned! Records, statistics,\r\ndocuments, failing which France would have been ruined, circumlocution,\r\nwithout which there could be no advance, increased, multiplied, and grew\r\nmajestic. From that day forth bureaucracy used to its own profit the\r\nmistrust that stands between receipts and expenditures; it degraded the\r\nadministration for the benefit of the administrators; in short, it\r\nspun those lilliputian threads which have chained France to Parisian\r\ncentralization,--as if from 1500 to 1800 France had undertaken nothing\r\nfor want of thirty thousand government clerks! In fastening upon public\r\noffices, like a mistletoe on a pear-tree, these officials indemnified\r\nthemselves amply, and in the following manner.\r\n\r\nThe ministers, compelled to obey the princes or the Chambers who impose\r\nupon them the distribution of the public moneys, and forced to retain\r\nthe workers in office, proceeded to diminish salaries and increase the\r\nnumber of those workers, thinking that if more persons were employed by\r\ngovernment the stronger the government would be. And yet the contrary\r\nlaw is an axiom written on the universe; there is no vigor except where\r\nthere are few active principles. Events proved in July, 1830, the error\r\nof the materialism of the Restoration. To plant a government in the\r\nhearts of a nation it is necessary to bind INTERESTS to it, not MEN. The\r\ngovernment-clerks being led to detest the administrations which lessened\r\nboth their salaries and their importance, treated them as a courtesan\r\ntreats an aged lover, and gave them mere work for money; a state of\r\nthings which would have seemed as intolerable to the administration as\r\nto the clerks, had the two parties dared to feel each other’s pulse,\r\nor had the higher salaries not succeeded in stifling the voices of the\r\nlower. Thus wholly and solely occupied in retaining his place, drawing\r\nhis pay, and securing his pension, the government official thought\r\neverything permissible that conduced to these results. This state\r\nof things led to servility on the part of the clerks and to endless\r\nintrigues within the various departments, where the humbler clerks\r\nstruggled vainly against degenerate members of the aristocracy, who\r\nsought positions in the government bureaus for their ruined sons.\r\n\r\nSuperior men could scarcely bring themselves to tread these tortuous\r\nways, to stoop, to cringe, and creep through the mire of these cloacas,\r\nwhere the presence of a fine mind only alarmed the other denizens. The\r\nambitious man of genius grows old in obtaining his triple crown; he does\r\nnot follow in the steps of Sixtus the Fifth merely to become head of\r\na bureau. No one comes or stays in the government offices but idlers,\r\nincapables, or fools. Thus the mediocrity of French administration has\r\nslowly come about. Bureaucracy, made up entirely of petty minds, stands\r\nas an obstacle to the prosperity of the nation; delays for seven years,\r\nby its machinery, the project of a canal which would have stimulated\r\nthe production of a province; is afraid of everything, prolongs\r\nprocrastination, and perpetuates the abuses which in turn perpetuate and\r\nconsolidate itself. Bureaucracy holds all things and the administration\r\nitself in leading strings; it stifles men of talent who are bold enough\r\nto be independent of it or to enlighten it on its own follies. About the\r\ntime of which we write the pension list had just been issued, and on it\r\nRabourdin saw the name of an underling in office rated for a larger sum\r\nthan the old colonels, maimed and wounded for their country. In that\r\nfact lies the whole history of bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nAnother evil, brought about by modern customs, which Rabourdin counted\r\namong the causes of this secret demoralization, was the fact that\r\nthere is no real subordination in the administration in Paris; complete\r\nequality reigns between the head of an important division and the\r\nhumblest copying-clerk; one is as powerful as the other in an arena\r\noutside of which each lords it in his own way. Education, equally\r\ndistributed through the masses, brings the son of a porter into a\r\ngovernment office to decide the fate of some man of merit or some landed\r\nproprietor whose door-bell his father may have answered. The last comer\r\nis therefore on equal terms with the oldest veteran in the service. A\r\nwealthy supernumerary splashes his superior as he drives his tilbury\r\nto Longchamps and points with his whip to the poor father of a family,\r\nremarking to the pretty woman at his side, “That’s my chief.” The\r\nLiberals call this state of things Progress; Rabourdin thought it\r\nAnarchy at the heart of power. He saw how it resulted in restless\r\nintrigues, like those of a harem between eunuchs and women and imbecile\r\nsultans, or the petty troubles of nuns full of underhand vexations,\r\nor college tyrannies, or diplomatic manoeuvrings fit to terrify an\r\nambassador, all put in motion to obtain a fee or an increase in salary;\r\nit was like the hopping of fleas harnessed to pasteboard cars, the\r\nspitefulness of slaves, often visited on the minister himself. With all\r\nthis were the really useful men, the workers, victims of such parasites;\r\nmen sincerely devoted to their country, who stood vigorously out from\r\nthe background of the other incapables, yet who were often forced to\r\nsuccumb through unworthy trickery.\r\n\r\nAll the higher offices were gained through parliamentary influence,\r\nroyalty had nothing to do now with them, and the subordinate clerks\r\nbecame, after a time, merely the running-gear of the machine; the\r\nmost important considerations with them being to keep the wheels well\r\ngreased. This fatal conviction entering some of the best minds smothered\r\nmany statements conscientiously written on the secret evils of the\r\nnational government; lowered the courage of many hearts, and corrupted\r\nsterling honesty, weary of injustice and won to indifference by\r\ndeteriorating annoyances. A clerk in the employ of the Rothchilds\r\ncorresponds with all England; another, in a government office, may\r\ncommunicate with all the prefects; but where the one learns the way to\r\nmake his fortune, the other loses time and health and life to no\r\navail. An undermining evil lies here. Certainly a nation does not seem\r\nthreatened with immediate dissolution because an able clerk is sent away\r\nand a middling sort of man replaces him. Unfortunately for the welfare\r\nof nations individual men never seem essential to their existence. But\r\nin the long run when the belittling process is fully carried out nations\r\nwill disappear. Every one who seeks instruction on this point can look\r\nat Venice, Madrid, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Rome; all places which were\r\nformerly resplendent with mighty powers and are now destroyed by the\r\ninfiltrating littleness which gradually attained the highest eminence.\r\nWhen the day of struggle came, all was found rotten, the State succumbed\r\nto a weak attack. To worship the fool who succeeds, and not to grieve\r\nover the fall of an able man is the result of our melancholy education,\r\nof our manners and customs which drive men of intellect into disgust,\r\nand genius to despair.\r\n\r\nWhat a difficult undertaking is the rehabilitation of the Civil Service\r\nwhile the liberal cries aloud in his newspapers that the salaries of\r\nclerks are a standing theft, calls the items of the budget a cluster of\r\nleeches, and every year demands why the nation should be saddled with\r\na thousand millions of taxes. In Monsieur Rabourdin’s eyes the clerk in\r\nrelation to the budget was very much what the gambler is to the\r\ngame; that which he wins he puts back again. All remuneration implies\r\nsomething furnished. To pay a man a thousand francs a year and demand\r\nhis whole time was surely to organize theft and poverty. A galley-slave\r\ncosts nearly as much, and does less. But to expect a man whom the State\r\nremunerated with twelve thousand francs a year to devote himself to\r\nhis country was a profitable contract for both sides, fit to allure all\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\nThese reflections had led Rabourdin to desire the recasting of the\r\nclerical official staff. To employ fewer man, to double or treble\r\nsalaries, and do away with pensions, to choose only young clerks (as did\r\nNapoleon, Louis XIV., Richelieu, and Ximenes), but to keep them long and\r\ntrain them for the higher offices and greatest honors, these were the\r\nchief features of a reform which if carried out would be as beneficial\r\nto the State as to the clerks themselves. It is difficult to recount in\r\ndetail, chapter by chapter, a plan which embraced the whole budget and\r\ncontinued down through the minutest details of administration in order\r\nto keep the whole synthetical; but perhaps a slight sketch of the\r\nprincipal reforms will suffice for those who understand such matters, as\r\nwell as for those who are wholly ignorant of the administrative system.\r\nThough the historian’s position is rather hazardous in reproducing\r\na plan which may be thought the politics of a chimney-corner, it is,\r\nnevertheless, necessary to sketch it so as to explain the author of\r\nit by his own work. Were the recital of his efforts to be omitted, the\r\nreader would not believe the narrator’s word if he merely declared the\r\ntalent and the courage of this official.\r\n\r\nRabourdin’s plan divided the government into three ministries, or\r\ndepartments. He thought that if the France of former days possessed\r\nbrains strong enough to comprehend in one system both foreign and\r\ndomestic affairs, the France of to-day was not likely to be without its\r\nMazarin, its Suger, its Sully, its de Choiseul, or its Colbert to\r\ndirect even vast administrative departments. Besides, constitutionally\r\nspeaking, three ministries will agree better than seven; and, in the\r\nrestricted number there is less chance for mistaken choice; moreover,\r\nit might be that the kingdom would some day escape from those perpetual\r\nministerial oscillations which interfered with all plans of foreign\r\npolicy and prevented all ameliorations of home rule. In Austria, where\r\nmany diverse united nations present so many conflicting interests to\r\nbe conciliated and carried forward under one crown, two statesmen alone\r\nbear the burden of public affairs and are not overwhelmed by it. Was\r\nFrance less prolific of political capacities than Germany? The rather\r\nsilly game of what are called “constitutional institutions” carried\r\nbeyond bounds has ended, as everybody knows, in requiring a great many\r\noffices to satisfy the multifarious ambition of the middle classes. It\r\nseemed to Rabourdin, in the first place, natural to unite the ministry\r\nof war with the ministry of the navy. To his thinking the navy was\r\none of the current expenses of the war department, like the artillery,\r\ncavalry, infantry, and commissariat. Surely it was an absurdity to\r\ngive separate administrations to admirals and marshals when both were\r\nemployed to one end, namely, the defense of the nation, the overthrow of\r\nan enemy, and the security of the national possessions. The ministry\r\nof the interior ought in like manner to combine the departments of\r\ncommerce, police, and finances, or it belied its own name. To the\r\nministry of foreign affairs belonged the administration of justice, the\r\nhousehold of the king, and all that concerned arts, sciences, and belles\r\nlettres. All patronage ought to flow directly from the sovereign. Such\r\nministries necessitated the supremacy of a council. Each required\r\nthe work of two hundred officials, and no more, in its central\r\nadministration offices, where Rabourdin proposed that they should live,\r\nas in former days under the monarchy. Taking the sum of twelve thousand\r\nfrancs a year for each official as an average, he estimated seven\r\nmillions as the cost of the whole body of such officials, which actually\r\nstood at twenty in the budget.\r\n\r\nBy thus reducing the ministers to three heads he suppressed departments\r\nwhich had come to be useless, together with the enormous costs of their\r\nmaintenance in Paris. He proved that an arrondissement could be managed\r\nby ten men; a prefecture by a dozen at the most; which reduced the\r\nentire civil service force throughout France to five thousand men,\r\nexclusive of the departments of war and justice. Under this plan the\r\nclerks of the court were charged with the system of loans, and the\r\nministry of the interior with that of registration and the management\r\nof domains. Thus Rabourdin united in one centre all divisions that were\r\nallied in nature. The mortgage system, inheritance, and registration did\r\nnot pass outside of their own sphere of action and only required three\r\nadditional clerks in the justice courts and three in the royal courts.\r\nThe steady application of this principle brought Rabourdin to reforms\r\nin the finance system. He merged the collection of revenue into\r\none channel, taxing consumption in bulk instead of taxing property.\r\nAccording to his ideas, consumption was the sole thing properly taxable\r\nin times of peace. Land-taxes should always be held in reserve in case\r\nof war; for then only could the State justly demand sacrifices from\r\nthe soil, which was in danger; but in times of peace it was a serious\r\npolitical fault to burden it beyond a certain limit; otherwise it could\r\nnever be depended on in great emergencies. Thus a loan should be put on\r\nthe market when the country was tranquil, for at such times it could be\r\nplaced at par, instead of at fifty per cent loss as in bad times; in war\r\ntimes resort should be had to a land-tax.\r\n\r\n“The invasion of 1814 and 1815,” Rabourdin would say to his friends,\r\n“founded in France and practically explained an institution which\r\nneither Law nor Napoleon had been able to establish,--I mean Credit.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Xavier considered the true principles of this admirable\r\nmachine of civil service very little understood at the period when\r\nhe began his labor of reform in 1820. His scheme levied a toll on\r\nthe consumption by means of direct taxation and suppressed the whole\r\nmachinery of indirect taxation. The levying of the taxes was simplified\r\nby a single classification of a great number of articles. This did away\r\nwith the more harassing customs at the gates of the cities, and obtained\r\nthe largest revenues from the remainder, by lessening the enormous\r\nexpense of collecting them. To lighten the burden of taxation is not, in\r\nmatters of finance, to diminish the taxes, but to assess them better; if\r\nlightened, you increase the volume of business by giving it freer play;\r\nthe individual pays less and the State receives more. This reform, which\r\nmay seem immense, rests on very simple machinery. Rabourdin regarded\r\nthe tax on personal property as the most trustworthy representative of\r\ngeneral consumption. Individual fortunes are usually revealed in France\r\nby rentals, by the number of servants, horses, carriages, and luxuries,\r\nthe costs of which are all to the interest of the public treasury.\r\nHouses and what they contain vary comparatively but little, and are not\r\nliable to disappear. After pointing out the means of making a tax-list\r\non personal property which should be more impartial than the existing\r\nlist, Rabourdin assessed the sums to be brought into the treasury by\r\nindirect taxation as so much per cent on each individual share. A tax\r\nis a levy of money on things or persons under disguises that are more or\r\nless specious. These disguises, excellent when the object is to extort\r\nmoney, become ridiculous in the present day, when the class on which the\r\ntaxes weigh the heaviest knows why the State imposes them and by what\r\nmachinery they are given back. In fact the budget is not a strong-box to\r\nhold what is put into it, but a watering-pot; the more it takes in and\r\nthe more it pours out the better for the prosperity of the country.\r\nTherefore, supposing there are six millions of tax-payers in easy\r\ncircumstances (Rabourdin proved their existence, including the rich) is\r\nit not better to make them pay a duty on the consumption of wine, which\r\nwould not be more offensive than that on doors and windows and would\r\nreturn a hundred millions, rather than harass them by taxing the thing\r\nitself. By this system of taxation, each individual tax-payer pays less\r\nin reality, while the State receives more, and consumers profit by a\r\nvast reduction in the price of things which the State releases from its\r\nperpetual and harassing interference. Rabourdin’s scheme retained a tax\r\non the cultivation of vineyards, so as to protect that industry from the\r\ntoo great abundance of its own products. Then, to reach the consumption\r\nof the poorer tax-payers, the licences of retail dealers were taxed\r\naccording to the population of the neighborhoods in which they lived.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the State would receive without cost or vexatious\r\nhindrances an enormous revenue under three forms; namely, a duty on\r\nwine, on the cultivation of vineyards, and on licenses, where now\r\nan irritating array of taxes existed as a burden on itself and its\r\nofficials. Taxation was thus imposed upon the rich without overburdening\r\nthe poor. To give another example. Suppose a share assessed to each\r\nperson of one or two francs for the consumption of salt and you obtain\r\nten or a dozen millions; the modern “gabelle” disappears, the poor\r\nbreathe freer, agriculture is relieved, the State receives as much,\r\nand no tax-payer complains. All persons, whether they belong to the\r\nindustrial classes or to the capitalists, will see at once the benefits\r\nof a tax so assessed when they discover how commerce increases, and life\r\nis ameliorated in the country districts. In short, the State will see\r\nfrom year to year the number of her well-to-do tax-payers increasing. By\r\ndoing away with the machinery of indirect taxation, which is very costly\r\n(a State, as it were, within a State), both the public finances and the\r\nindividual tax-payer are greatly benefited, not to speak of the saving\r\nin costs of collecting.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject is indeed less a question of finance than a question\r\nof government. The State should possess nothing of its own, neither\r\nforests, nor mines, nor public works. That it should be the owner of\r\ndomains was, in Rabourdin’s opinion, an administrative contradiction.\r\nThe State cannot turn its possessions to profit and it deprives itself\r\nof taxes; it thus loses two forms of production. As to the manufactories\r\nof the government, they are just as unreasonable in the sphere of\r\nindustry. The State obtains products at a higher cost than those\r\nof commerce, produces them more slowly, and loses its tax upon the\r\nindustry, the maintenance of which it, in turn, reduces. Can it be\r\nthought a proper method of governing a country to manufacture instead\r\nof promoting manufactures? to possess property instead of creating\r\nmore possessions and more diverse ones? In Rabourdin’s system the State\r\nexacted no money security; he allowed only mortgage securities; and for\r\nthis reason: Either the State holds the security in specie, and that\r\nembarrasses business and the movement of money; or it invests it at\r\na higher rate than the State itself pays, and that is a contemptible\r\nrobbery; or else it loses on the transaction, and that is folly;\r\nmoreover, if it is obliged at any time to dispose of a mass of these\r\nsecurities it gives rises in certain cases to terrible bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe territorial tax did not entirely disappear in Rabourdin’s plan,--he\r\nkept a minute portion of it as a point of departure in case of war;\r\nbut the productions of the soil were freed, and industry, finding raw\r\nmaterial at a low price, could compete with foreign nations without the\r\ndeceptive help of customs. The rich carried on the administration of the\r\nprovinces without compensation except that of receiving a peerage under\r\ncertain conditions. Magistrates, learned bodies, officers of the lower\r\ngrades found their services honorably rewarded; no man employed by the\r\ngovernment failed to obtain great consideration through the value and\r\nextent of his labors and the excellence of his salary; every one was\r\nable to provide for his own future and France was delivered from the\r\ncancer of pensions. As a result Rabourdin’s scheme exhibited only\r\nseven hundred millions of expenditures and twelve hundred millions of\r\nreceipts. A saving of five hundred millions annually had far more virtue\r\nthan the accumulation of a sinking fund whose dangers were plainly to\r\nbe seen. In that fund the State, according to Rabourdin, became\r\na stockholder, just as it persisted in being a land-holder and a\r\nmanufacturer. To bring about these reforms without too roughly jarring\r\nthe existing state of things or incurring a Saint-Bartholomew of\r\nclerks, Rabourdin considered that an evolution of twenty years would be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts maturing in Rabourdin’s mind ever since his\r\npromised place had been given to Monsieur de la Billardiere, a man of\r\nsheer incapacity. This plan, so vast apparently yet so simple in point\r\nof fact, which did away with so many large staffs and so many little\r\noffices all equally useless, required for its presentation to the public\r\nmind close calculations, precise statistics, and self-evident proof.\r\nRabourdin had long studied the budget under its double-aspect of ways\r\nand means and of expenditure. Many a night he had lain awake unknown to\r\nhis wife. But so far he had only dared to conceive the plan and fit it\r\nprospectively to the administrative skeleton; all of which counted for\r\nnothing,--he must gain the ear of a minister capable of appreciating\r\nhis ideas. Rabourdin’s success depended on the tranquil condition of\r\npolitical affairs, which up to this time were still unsettled. He had\r\nnot considered the government as permanently secure until three\r\nhundred deputies at least had the courage to form a compact majority\r\nsystematically ministerial. An administration founded on that basis had\r\ncome into power since Rabourdin had finished his elaborate plan. At this\r\ntime the luxury of peace under the Bourbons had eclipsed the warlike\r\nluxury of the days when France shone like a vast encampment, prodigal\r\nand magnificent because it was victorious. After the Spanish campaign,\r\nthe administration seemed to enter upon an era of tranquillity in which\r\nsome good might be accomplished; and three months before the opening of\r\nour story a new reign had begun without any apparent opposition; for the\r\nliberalism of the Left had welcomed Charles X. with as much enthusiasm\r\nas the Right. Even clear-sighted and suspicious persons were misled. The\r\nmoment seemed propitious for Rabourdin. What could better conduce to the\r\nstability of the government than to propose and carry through a reform\r\nwhose beneficial results were to be so vast?\r\n\r\nNever had Rabourdin seemed so anxious and preoccupied as he now did\r\nin the mornings as he walked from his house to the ministry, or at\r\nhalf-past four in the afternoon, when he returned. Madame Rabourdin, on\r\nher part, disconsolate over her wasted life, weary of secretly\r\nworking to obtain a few luxuries of dress, never appeared so bitterly\r\ndiscontented as now; but, like any wife who is really attached to her\r\nhusband, she considered it unworthy of a superior woman to condescend\r\nto the shameful devices by which the wives of some officials eke out the\r\ninsufficiency of their husband’s salary. This feeling made her refuse\r\nall intercourse with Madame Colleville, then very intimate with Francois\r\nKeller, whose parties eclipsed those of the rue Duphot. Nevertheless,\r\nshe mistook the quietude of the political thinker and the preoccupation\r\nof the intrepid worker for the apathetic torpor of an official broken\r\ndown by the dulness of routine, vanquished by that most hateful of all\r\nmiseries, the mediocrity that simply earns a living; and she groaned at\r\nbeing married to a man without energy.\r\n\r\nThus it was that about this period in their lives she resolved to take\r\nthe making of her husband’s fortune on herself; to thrust him at any\r\ncost into a higher sphere, and to hide from him the secret springs of\r\nher machinations. She carried into all her plans the independence of\r\nideas which characterized her, and was proud to think that she could\r\nrise above other women by sharing none of their petty prejudices and by\r\nkeeping herself untrammelled by the restraints which society imposes.\r\nIn her anger she resolved to fight fools with their own weapons, and to\r\nmake herself a fool if need be. She saw things coming to a crisis. The\r\ntime was favorable. Monsieur de la Billardiere, attacked by a dangerous\r\nillness, was likely to die in a few days. If Rabourdin succeeded him,\r\nhis talents (for Celestine did vouchsafe him an administrative gift)\r\nwould be so thoroughly appreciated that the office of Master of\r\npetitions, formerly promised, would now be given to him; she fancied she\r\nsaw him the king’s commissioner, presenting bills to the Chambers and\r\ndefending them; then indeed she could help him; she would even be, if\r\nneedful, his secretary; she would sit up all night to do the work! All\r\nthis to drive in the Bois in a pretty carriage, to equal Madame Delphine\r\nde Nucingen, to raise her salon to the level of Madame Colleville’s, to\r\nbe invited to the great ministerial solemnities, to win listeners and\r\nmake them talk of her as “Madame Rabourdin DE something or other”\r\n (she had not yet determined on the estate), just as they did of Madame\r\nFirmiani, Madame d’Espard, Madame d’Aiglemont, Madame de Carigliano, and\r\nthus efface forever the odious name of Rabourdin.\r\n\r\nThese secret schemes brought some changes into the household. Madame\r\nRabourdin began to walk with a firm step in the path of /debt/. She set\r\nup a man-servant, and put him in livery of brown cloth with red pipins,\r\nshe renewed parts of her furniture, hung new papers on the walls,\r\nadorned her salon with plants and flowers, always fresh, and crowded\r\nit with knick-knacks that were then in vogue; then she, who had always\r\nshown scruples as to her personal expenses, did not hesitate to put\r\nher dress in keeping with the rank to which she aspired, the profits of\r\nwhich were discounted in several of the shops where she equipped herself\r\nfor war. To make her “Wednesdays” fashionable she gave a dinner on\r\nFridays, the guests being expected to pay their return visit and take\r\na cup of tea on the following Wednesday. She chose her guests cleverly\r\namong influential deputies or other persons of note who, sooner or\r\nlater, might advance her interests. In short, she gathered an agreeable\r\nand befitting circle about her. People amused themselves at her house;\r\nthey said so at least, which is quite enough to attract society in\r\nParis. Rabourdin was so absorbed in completing his great and serious\r\nwork that he took no notice of the sudden reappearance of luxury in the\r\nbosom of his family.\r\n\r\nThus the wife and the husband were besieging the same fortress, working\r\non parallel lines, but without each other’s knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. MONSIEUR DES LUPEAULX\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the ministry to which Rabourdin belonged there flourished, as\r\ngeneral-secretary, a certain Monsieur Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx, one\r\nof those men whom the tide of political events sends to the surface for\r\na few years, then engulfs on a stormy night, but whom we find again on a\r\ndistant shore, tossed up like the carcass of a wrecked ship which still\r\nseems to have life in her. We ask ourselves if that derelict could ever\r\nhave held goodly merchandise or served a high emprise, co-operated\r\nin some defence, held up the trappings of a throne, or borne away the\r\ncorpse of a monarchy. At this particular time Clement des Lupeaulx (the\r\n“Lupeaulx” absorbed the “Chardin”) had reached his culminating period.\r\nIn the most illustrious lives as in the most obscure, in animals as in\r\nsecretary-generals, there is a zenith and there is a nadir, a period\r\nwhen the fur is magnificent, the fortune dazzling. In the nomenclature\r\nwhich we derive from fabulists, des Lupeaulx belonged to the species\r\nBertrand, and was always in search of Ratons. As he is one of the\r\nprincipal actors in this drama he deserves a description, all the\r\nmore precise because the revolution of July has suppressed his office,\r\neminently useful as it was, to a constitutional ministry.\r\n\r\nMoralists usually employ their weapons against obstructive\r\nadministrations. In their eyes, crime belongs to the assizes or the\r\npolice-courts; but the socially refined evils escape their ken; the\r\nadroitness that triumphs under shield of the Code is above them or\r\nbeneath them; they have neither eye-glass nor telescope; they want good\r\nstout horrors easily visible. With their eyes fixed on the carnivora,\r\nthey pay no attention to the reptiles; happily, they abandon to the\r\nwriters of comedy the shading and colorings of a Chardin des Lupeaulx.\r\nVain and egotistical, supple and proud, libertine and gourmand, grasping\r\nfrom the pressure of debt, discreet as a tomb out of which nought\r\nissues to contradict the epitaph intended for the passer’s eye, bold and\r\nfearless when soliciting, good-natured and witty in all acceptations\r\nof the word, a timely jester, full of tact, knowing how to compromise\r\nothers by a glance or a nudge, shrinking from no mudhole, but gracefully\r\nleaping it, intrepid Voltairean, yet punctual at mass if a fashionable\r\ncompany could be met in Saint Thomas Aquinas,--such a man as this\r\nsecretary-general resembled, in one way or another, all the mediocrities\r\nwho form the kernel of the political world. Knowing in the science of\r\nhuman nature, he assumed the character of a listener, and none was ever\r\nmore attentive. Not to awaken suspicion he was flattering ad nauseum,\r\ninsinuating as a perfume, and cajoling as a woman.\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx was just forty years old. His youth had long been a\r\nvexation to him, for he felt that the making of his career depended on\r\nhis becoming a deputy. How had he reached his present position? may\r\nbe asked. By very simple means. He began by taking charge of certain\r\ndelicate missions which can be given neither to a man who respects\r\nhimself nor to a man who does not respect himself, but are confided to\r\ngrave and enigmatic individuals who can be acknowledged or disavowed\r\nat will. His business was that of being always compromised; but his\r\nfortunes were pushed as much by defeat as by success. He well understood\r\nthat under the Restoration, a period of continual compromises between\r\nmen, between things, between accomplished facts and other facts looking\r\non the horizon, it was all-important for the ruling powers to have a\r\nhousehold drudge. Observe in a family some old charwoman who can make\r\nbeds, sweep the floors, carry away the dirty linen, who knows where\r\nthe silver is kept, how the creditors should be pacified, what persons\r\nshould be let in and who must be kept out of the house, and such a\r\ncreature, even if she has all the vices, and is dirty, decrepit, and\r\ntoothless, or puts into the lottery and steals thirty sous a day for\r\nher stake, and you will find the masters like her from habit, talk and\r\nconsult in her hearing upon even critical matters; she comes and goes,\r\nsuggests resources, gets on the scent of secrets, brings the rouge\r\nor the shawl at the right moment, lets herself be scolded and pushed\r\ndownstairs, and the next morning reappears smiling with an excellent\r\nbouillon. No matter how high a statesman may stand, he is certain\r\nto have some household drudge, before whom he is weak, undecided,\r\ndisputations with fate, self-questioning, self-answering, and buckling\r\nfor the fight. Such a familiar is like the soft wood of savages,\r\nwhich, when rubbed against the hard wood, strikes fire. Sometimes great\r\ngeniuses illumine themselves in this way. Napoleon lived with Berthier,\r\nRichelieu with Pere Joseph; des Lupeaulx was the familiar of everybody.\r\nHe continued friends with fallen ministers and made himself their\r\nintermediary with their successors, diffusing thus the perfume of\r\nthe last flattery and the first compliment. He well understood how\r\nto arrange all the little matters which a statesman has no leisure to\r\nattend to. He saw necessities as they arose; he obeyed well; he could\r\ngloss a base act with a jest and get the whole value of it; and he chose\r\nfor the services he thus rendered those that the recipients were not\r\nlikely to forget.\r\n\r\nThus, when it was necessary to cross the ditch between the Empire and\r\nthe Restoration, at a time when every one was looking about for planks,\r\nand the curs of the Empire were howling their devotion right and left,\r\ndes Lupeaulx borrowed large sums from the usurers and crossed the\r\nfrontier. Risking all to win all, he bought up Louis XVIII.’s most\r\npressing debts, and was the first to settle nearly three million of them\r\nat twenty per cent--for he was lucky enough to be backed by Gobseck in\r\n1814 and 1815. It is true that Messrs. Gobseck, Werdet, and Gigonnet\r\nswallowed the profits, but des Lupeaulx had agreed that they should\r\nhave them; he was not playing for a stake; he challenged the bank, as it\r\nwere, knowing very well that the king was not a man to forget this debt\r\nof honor. Des Lupeaulx was not mistaken; he was appointed Master of\r\npetitions, Knight of the order of Saint Louis, and officer of the Legion\r\nof honor. Once on the ladder of political success, his clever mind\r\nlooked about for the means to maintain his foothold; for in the\r\nfortified city into which he had wormed himself, generals do not long\r\nkeep useless mouths. So to his general trade of household drudge and\r\ngo-between he added that of gratuitous consultation on the secret\r\nmaladies of power.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering in the so-called superior men of the Restoration their\r\nutter inferiority in comparison with the events which had brought them\r\nto the front, he overcame their political mediocrity by putting into\r\ntheir mouths, at a crisis, the word of command for which men of real\r\ntalent were listening. It must not be thought that this word was the\r\noutcome of his own mind. Were it so, des Lupeaulx would have been a\r\nman of genius, whereas he was only a man of talent. He went everywhere,\r\ncollected opinions, sounded consciences, and caught all the tones they\r\ngave out. He gathered knowledge like a true and indefatigable political\r\nbee. This walking Bayle dictionary did not act, however, like that\r\nfamous lexicon; he did not report all opinions without drawing his own\r\nconclusions; he had the talent of a fly which drops plumb upon the\r\nbest bit of meat in the middle of a kitchen. In this way he came to\r\nbe regarded as an indispensable helper to statesmen. A belief in his\r\ncapacity had taken such deep root in all minds that the more ambitious\r\npublic men felt it was necessary to compromise des Lupeaulx in some way\r\nto prevent his rising higher; they made up to him for his subordinate\r\npublic position by their secret confidence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, feeling that such men were dependent on him, this gleaner\r\nof ideas exacted certain dues. He received a salary on the staff of the\r\nNational Guard, where he held a sinecure which was paid for by the city\r\nof Paris; he was government commissioner to a secret society; and filled\r\na position of superintendence in the royal household. His two official\r\nposts which appeared on the budget were those of secretary-general to\r\nhis ministry and Master of petitions. What he now wanted was to be made\r\ncommander of the Legion of honor, gentleman of the bed-chamber, count,\r\nand deputy. To be elected deputy it was necessary to pay taxes to the\r\namount of a thousand francs; and the miserable homestead of the des\r\nLupeaulx was rated at only five hundred. Where could he get money to\r\nbuild a mansion and surround it with sufficient domain to throw dust\r\nin the eyes of a constituency? Though he dined out every day, and was\r\nlodged for the last nine years at the cost of the State, and driven\r\nabout in the minister’s equipage, des Lupeaulx possessed absolutely\r\nnothing, at the time when our tale opens, but thirty thousand francs\r\nof debt--undisputed property. A marriage might float him and pump the\r\nwaters of debt out of his bark; but a good marriage depended on his\r\nadvancement, and his advancement required that he should be a deputy.\r\nSearching about him for the means of breaking through this vicious\r\ncircle, he could think of nothing better than some immense service to\r\nrender or some delicate intrigue to carry through for persons in power.\r\nAlas! conspiracies were out of date; the Bourbons were apparently on\r\ngood terms with all parties; and, unfortunately, for the last few years\r\nthe government had been so thoroughly held up to the light of day by the\r\nsilly discussions of the Left, whose aim seemed to be to make government\r\nof any kind impossible in France, that no good strokes of business could\r\nbe made. The last were tried in Spain, and what an outcry that excited!\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, des Lupeaulx complicated matters by believing\r\nin the friendship of his minister, to whom he had the imprudence to\r\nexpress the wish to sit on the ministerial benches. The minister guessed\r\nat the real meaning of the desire, which simply was that des Lupeaulx\r\nwanted to strengthen a precarious position, so that he might throw off\r\nall dependence on his chief. The harrier turned against the huntsman;\r\nthe minister gave him cuts with the whip and caresses, alternately, and\r\nset up rivals to him. But des Lupeaulx behaved like an adroit courtier\r\nwith all competitors; he laid traps into which they fell, and then he\r\ndid prompt justice upon them. The more he felt himself in danger the\r\nmore anxious he became for an irremovable position; yet he was compelled\r\nto play low; one moment’s indiscretion, and he might lose everything. A\r\npen-stroke might demolish his civilian epaulets, his place at court,\r\nhis sinecure, his two offices and their advantages; in all, six\r\nsalaries retained under fire of the law against pluralists. Sometimes he\r\nthreatened his minister as a mistress threatens her lover; telling him\r\nhe was about to marry a rich widow. At such times the minister petted\r\nand cajoled des Lupeaulx. After one of these reconciliations he received\r\nthe formal promise of a place in the Academy of Belles-lettres on the\r\nfirst vacancy. “It would pay,” he said, “the keep of a horse.” His\r\nposition, so far as it went, was a good one, and Clement Chardin des\r\nLupeaulx flourished in it like a tree planted in good soil. He could\r\nsatisfy his vices, his caprices, his virtues and his defects.\r\n\r\nThe following were the toils of his life. He was obliged to choose,\r\namong five or six daily invitations, the house where he could be sure\r\nof the best dinner. Every morning he went to his minister’s morning\r\nreception to amuse that official and his wife, and to pet their\r\nchildren. Then he worked an hour or two; that is to say, he lay back in\r\na comfortable chair and read the newspapers, dictated the meaning of a\r\nletter, received visitors when the minister was not present, explained\r\nthe work in a general way, caught or shed a few drops of the holy-water\r\nof the court, looked over the petitions with an eyeglass, or wrote his\r\nname on the margin,--a signature which meant “I think it absurd; do\r\nwhat you like about it.” Every body knew that when des Lupeaulx was\r\ninterested in any person or in any thing he attended to the matter\r\npersonally. He allowed the head-clerks to converse privately about\r\naffairs of delicacy, but he listened to their gossip. From time to time\r\nhe went to the Tuileries to get his cue. And he always waited for the\r\nminister’s return from the Chamber, if in session, to hear from him\r\nwhat intrigue or manoeuvre he was to set about. This official sybarite\r\ndressed, dined, and visited a dozen or fifteen salons between eight at\r\nnight and three in the morning. At the opera he talked with journalists,\r\nfor he stood high in their favor; a perpetual exchange of little\r\nservices went on between them; he poured into their ears his misleading\r\nnews and swallowed theirs; he prevented them from attacking this or that\r\nminister on such or such a matter, on the plea that it would cause real\r\npain to their wives or their mistresses.\r\n\r\n“Say that his bill is worth nothing, and prove it if you can, but do\r\nnot say that Mariette danced badly. The devil! haven’t we all played\r\nour little plays; and which of us knows what will become of him in times\r\nlike these? You may be minister yourself to-morrow, you who are spicing\r\nthe cakes of the ‘Constitutionel’ to-day.”\r\n\r\nSometimes, in return, he helped editors, or got rid of obstacles to the\r\nperformances of some play; gave gratuities and good dinners at the\r\nright moment, or promised his services to bring some affair to a happy\r\nconclusion. Moreover, he really liked literature and the arts; he\r\ncollected autographs, obtained splendid albums gratis, and possessed\r\nsketches, engravings, and pictures. He did a great deal of good to\r\nartists by simply not injuring them and by furthering their wishes\r\non certain occasions when their self-love wanted some rather costly\r\ngratification. Consequently, he was much liked in the world of actors\r\nand actresses, journalists and artists. For one thing, they had the\r\nsame vices and the same indolence as himself. Men who could all say such\r\nwitty things in their cups or in company with a danseuse, how could they\r\nhelp being friends? If des Lupeaulx had not been a general-secretary\r\nhe would certainly have been a journalist. Thus, in that fifteen years’\r\nstruggle in which the harlequin sabre of epigram opened a breach by\r\nwhich insurrection entered the citadel, des Lupeaulx never received so\r\nmuch as a scratch.\r\n\r\nAs the young fry of clerks looked at this man playing bowls in the\r\ngardens of the ministry with the minister’s children, they cracked\r\ntheir brains to guess the secret of his influence and the nature of his\r\nservices; while, on the other hand, the aristocrats in all the various\r\nministries looked upon him as a dangerous Mephistopheles, courted him,\r\nand gave him back with usury the flatteries he bestowed in the higher\r\nsphere. As difficult to decipher as a hieroglyphic inscription to the\r\nclerks, the vocation of the secretary and his usefulness were as plain\r\nas the rule of three to the self-interested. This lesser Prince de\r\nWagram of the administration, to whom the duty of gathering opinions\r\nand ideas and making verbal reports thereon was entrusted, knew all the\r\nsecrets of parliamentary politics; dragged in the lukewarm, fetched,\r\ncarried, and buried propositions, said the Yes and the No that the\r\nministers dared not say for themselves. Compelled to receive the first\r\nfire and the first blows of despair and wrath, he laughed or bemoaned\r\nhimself with the minister, as the case might be. Mysterious link by\r\nwhich many interests were in some way connected with the Tuileries, and\r\nsafe as a confessor, he sometimes knew everything and sometimes nothing;\r\nand, in addition to all these functions came that of saying for the\r\nminister those things that a minister cannot say for himself. In short,\r\nwith his political Hephaestion the minister might dare to be himself; to\r\ntake off his wig and his false teeth, lay aside his scruples, put on\r\nhis slippers, unbutton his conscience, and give way to his trickery.\r\nHowever, it was not all a bed of roses for des Lupeaulx; he flattered\r\nand advised his master, forced to flatter in order to advise, to advise\r\nwhile flattering, and disguise the advice under the flattery. All\r\npoliticians who follow this trade have bilious faces; and their constant\r\nhabit of giving affirmative nods acquiescing in what is said to them,\r\nor seeming to do so, gives a certain peculiar turn to their heads. They\r\nagree indifferently with whatever is said before them. Their talk is\r\nfull of “buts,” “notwithstandings,” “for myself I should,” “were I in\r\nyour place” (they often say “in your place”),--phrases, however, which\r\npave the way to opposition.\r\n\r\nIn person, Clement des Lupeaulx had the remains of a handsome man; five\r\nfeet six inches tall, tolerably stout, complexion flushed with good\r\nliving, powdered head, delicate spectacles, and a worn-out air; the\r\nnatural skin blond, as shown by the hand, puffy like that of an old\r\nwoman, rather too square, and with short nails--the hand of a satrap.\r\nHis foot was elegant. After five o’clock in the afternoon des Lupeaulx\r\nwas always to be seen in open-worked silk stockings, low shoes, black\r\ntrousers, cashmere waistcoat, cambric handkerchief (without perfume),\r\ngold chain, blue coat of the shade called “king’s blue,” with brass\r\nbuttons and a string of orders. In the morning he wore creaking boots\r\nand gray trousers, and the short close surtout coat of the politician.\r\nHis general appearance early in the day was that of a sharp lawyer\r\nrather than that of a ministerial officer. Eyes glazed by the constant\r\nuse of spectacles made him plainer than he really was, if by chance he\r\ntook those appendages off. To real judges of character, as well as to\r\nupright men who are at ease only with honest natures, des Lupeaulx was\r\nintolerable. To them, his gracious manners only draped his lies; his\r\namiable protestations and hackneyed courtesies, new to the foolish and\r\nignorant, too plainly showed their texture to an observing mind. Such\r\nminds considered him a rotten plank, on which no foot should trust\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the beautiful Madame Rabourdin decided to interfere in\r\nher husband’s administrative advancement than she fathomed Clement des\r\nLupeaulx’s true character, and studied him thoughtfully to discover\r\nwhether in this thin strip of deal there were ligneous fibres strong\r\nenough to let her lightly trip across it from the bureau to the\r\ndepartment, from a salary of eight thousand a year to twelve thousand.\r\nThe clever woman believed she could play her own game with this\r\npolitical roue; and Monsieur des Lupeaulx was partly the cause of the\r\nunusual expenditures which now began and were continued in the Rabourdin\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nThe rue Duphot, built up under the Empire, is remarkable for several\r\nhouses with handsome exteriors, the apartments of which are skilfully\r\nlaid out. That of the Rabourdins was particularly well arranged,--a\r\ndomestic advantage which has much to do with the nobleness of private\r\nlives. A pretty and rather wide antechamber, lighted from the courtyard,\r\nled to the grand salon, the windows of which looked on the street. To\r\nthe right of the salon were Rabourdin’s study and bedroom, and behind\r\nthem the dining-room, which was entered from the antechamber; to\r\nthe left was Madame’s bedroom and dressing-room, and behind them her\r\ndaughter’s little bedroom. On reception days the door of Rabourdin’s\r\nstudy and that of his wife’s bedroom were thrown open. The rooms were\r\nthus spacious enough to contain a select company, without the\r\nabsurdity which attends many middle-class entertainments, where\r\nunusual preparations are made at the expense of the daily comfort, and\r\nconsequently give the effect of exceptional effort. The salon had\r\nlately been rehung in gold-colored silk with carmelite touches. Madame’s\r\nbedroom was draped in a fabric of true blue and furnished in a rococo\r\nmanner. Rabourdin’s study had inherited the late hangings of the salon,\r\ncarefully cleaned, and was adorned by the fine pictures once belonging\r\nto Monsieur Leprince. The daughter of the late auctioneer had utilized\r\nin her dining-room certain exquisite Turkish rugs which her father had\r\nbought at a bargain; panelling them on the walls in ebony, the cost of\r\nwhich has since become exorbitant. Elegant buffets made by Boulle, also\r\npurchased by the auctioneer, furnished the sides of the room, at the end\r\nof which sparkled the brass arabesques inlaid in tortoise-shell of the\r\nfirst tall clock that reappeared in the nineteenth century to claim\r\nhonor for the masterpieces of the seventeenth. Flowers perfumed these\r\nrooms so full of good taste and of exquisite things, where each detail\r\nwas a work of art well placed and well surrounded, and where Madame\r\nRabourdin, dressed with that natural simplicity which artists alone\r\nattain, gave the impression of a woman accustomed to such elegancies,\r\nthough she never spoke of them, but allowed the charms of her mind\r\nto complete the effect produced upon her guests by these delightful\r\nsurroundings. Thanks to her father, Celestine was able to make society\r\ntalk of her as soon as the rococo became fashionable.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as des Lupeaulx was to false as well as real magnificence in\r\nall their stages, he was, nevertheless, surprised at Madame Rabourdin’s\r\nhome. The charm it exercised over this Parisian Asmodeus can be\r\nexplained by a comparison. A traveller wearied with the rich aspects of\r\nItaly, Brazil, or India, returns to his own land and finds on his way a\r\ndelightful little lake, like the Lac d’Orta at the foot of Monte Rosa,\r\nwith an island resting on the calm waters, bewitchingly simple; a scene\r\nof nature and yet adorned; solitary, but well surrounded with choice\r\nplantations and foliage and statues of fine effect. Beyond lies a vista\r\nof shores both wild and cultivated; tumultuous grandeur towers above,\r\nbut in itself all proportions are human. The world that the traveller\r\nhas lately viewed is here in miniature, modest and pure; his soul,\r\nrefreshed, bids him remain where a charm of melody and poesy surrounds\r\nhim with harmony and awakens ideas within his mind. Such a scene\r\nrepresents both life and a monastery.\r\n\r\nA few days earlier the beautiful Madame Firmiani, one of the charming\r\nwomen of the faubourg Saint-Germain who visited and liked Madame\r\nRabourdin, had said to des Lupeaulx (invited expressly to hear this\r\nremark), “Why do you not call on Madame ----?” with a motion towards\r\nCelestine; “she gives delightful parties, and her dinners, above all,\r\nare--better than mine.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx allowed himself to be drawn into an engagement by the\r\nhandsome Madame Rabourdin, who, for the first time, turned her eyes on\r\nhim as she spoke. He had, accordingly, gone to the rue Duphot, and\r\nthat tells the tale. Woman has but one trick, cries Figaro, but that’s\r\ninfallible. After dining once at the house of this unimportant official,\r\ndes Lupeaulx made up his mind to dine there often. Thanks to the\r\nperfectly proper and becoming advances of the beautiful woman, whom her\r\nrival, Madame Colleville, called the Celimene of the rue Duphot, he had\r\ndined there every Friday for the last month, and returned of his own\r\naccord for a cup of tea on Wednesdays.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days Madame Rabourdin, having watched him narrowly and\r\nknowingly, believed she had found on the secretarial plank a spot where\r\nshe might safely set her foot. She was no longer doubtful of success.\r\nHer inward joy can be realized only in the families of government\r\nofficials where for three or four years prosperity has been counted\r\non through some appointment, long expected and long sought. How many\r\ntroubles are to be allayed! how many entreaties and pledges given to the\r\nministerial divinities! how many visits of self-interest paid! At last,\r\nthanks to her boldness, Madame Rabourdin heard the hour strike when she\r\nwas to have twenty thousand francs a year instead of eight thousand.\r\n\r\n“And I shall have managed well,” she said to herself. “I have had\r\nto make a little outlay; but these are times when hidden merit is\r\noverlooked, whereas if a man keeps himself well in sight before the\r\nworld, cultivates social relations and extends them, he succeeds. After\r\nall, ministers and their friends interest themselves only in the people\r\nthey see; but Rabourdin knows nothing of the world! If I had not cajoled\r\nthose three deputies they might have wanted La Billardiere’s place\r\nthemselves; whereas, now that I have invited them here, they will be\r\nashamed to do so and will become our supporters instead of rivals. I\r\nhave rather played the coquette, but--it is delightful that the first\r\nnonsense with which one fools a man sufficed.”\r\n\r\nThe day on which a serious and unlooked-for struggle about this\r\nappointment began, after a ministerial dinner which preceded one of\r\nthose receptions which ministers regard as public, des Lupeaulx was\r\nstanding beside the fireplace near the minister’s wife. While taking his\r\ncoffee he once more included Madame Rabourdin among the seven or eight\r\nreally superior women in Paris. Several times already he had staked\r\nMadame Rabourdin very much as Corporal Trim staked his cap.\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that too often, my dear friend, or you will injure her,” said\r\nthe minister’s wife, half-laughing.\r\n\r\nWomen never like to hear the praise of other women; they keep silence\r\nthemselves to lessen its effect.\r\n\r\n“Poor La Billardiere is dying,” remarked his Excellency the minister;\r\n“that place falls to Rabourdin, one of our most able men, and to whom\r\nour predecessors did not behave well, though one of them actually owed\r\nhis position in the prefecture of police under the Empire to a certain\r\ngreat personage who was interested in Rabourdin. But, my dear friend,\r\nyou are still young enough to be loved by a pretty woman for yourself--”\r\n\r\n“If La Billardiere’s place is given to Rabourdin I may be believed when\r\nI praise the superiority of his wife,” replied des Lupeaulx, piqued by\r\nthe minister’s sarcasm; “but if Madame la Comtesse would be willing to\r\njudge for herself--”\r\n\r\n“You want me to invite her to my next ball, don’t you? Your clever woman\r\nwill meet a knot of other women who only come here to laugh at us, and\r\nwhen they hear ‘Madame Rabourdin’ announced--”\r\n\r\n“But Madame Firmiani is announced at the Foreign Office parties?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but she was born a Cadignan!” said the newly created count, with a\r\nsavage look at his general-secretary, for neither he nor his wife were\r\nnoble.\r\n\r\nThe persons present thought important matters were being talked\r\nover, and the solicitors for favors and appointments kept at a little\r\ndistance. When des Lupeaulx left the room the countess said to her\r\nhusband, “I think des Lupeaulx is in love.”\r\n\r\n“For the first time in his life, then,” he replied, shrugging his\r\nshoulders, as much as to inform his wife that des Lupeaulx did not\r\nconcern himself with such nonsense.\r\n\r\nJust then the minister saw a deputy of the Right Centre enter the room,\r\nand he left his wife abruptly to cajole an undecided vote. But the\r\ndeputy, under the blow of a sudden and unexpected disaster, wanted to\r\nmake sure of a protector and he had come to announce privately that in a\r\nfew days he should be compelled to resign. Thus forewarned, the minister\r\nwould be able to open his batteries for the new election before those of\r\nthe opposition.\r\n\r\nThe minister, or to speak correctly, des Lupeaulx had invited to dinner\r\non this occasion one of those irremovable officials who, as we have\r\nsaid, are to be found in every ministry; an individual much embarrassed\r\nby his own person, who, in his desire to maintain a dignified\r\nappearance, was standing erect and rigid on his two legs, held well\r\ntogether like the Greek hermae. This functionary waited near the\r\nfireplace to thank the secretary, whose abrupt and unexpected departure\r\nfrom the room disconcerted him at the moment when he was about to turn\r\na compliment. This official was the cashier of the ministry, the only\r\nclerk who did not tremble when the government changed hands.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which we write, the Chamber did not meddle shabbily with\r\nthe budget, as it does in the deplorable days in which we now live; it\r\ndid not contemptibly reduce ministerial emoluments, nor save, as they\r\nsay in the kitchen, the candle-ends; on the contrary, it granted to each\r\nminister taking charge of a public department an indemnity, called an\r\n“outfit.” It costs, alas, as much to enter on the duties of a minister\r\nas to retire from them; indeed, the entrance involves expenses of all\r\nkinds which it is quite impossible to inventory. This indemnity amounted\r\nto the pretty little sum of twenty-five thousand francs. When the\r\nappointment of a new minister was gazetted in the “Moniteur,” and the\r\ngreater or lesser officials, clustering round the stoves or before the\r\nfireplaces and shaking in their shoes, asked themselves: “What will he\r\ndo? will he increase the number of clerks? will he dismiss two to make\r\nroom for three?” the cashier tranquilly took out twenty-five clean\r\nbank-bills and pinned them together with a satisfied expression on\r\nhis beadle face. The next day he mounted the private staircase and\r\nhad himself ushered into the minister’s presence by the lackeys, who\r\nconsidered the money and the keeper of money, the contents and the\r\ncontainer, the idea and the form, as one and the same power. The cashier\r\ncaught the ministerial pair at the dawn of official delight, when the\r\nnewly appointed statesman is benign and affable. To the minister’s\r\ninquiry as to what brings him there, he replies with the\r\nbank-notes,--informing his Excellency that he hastens to pay him the\r\ncustomary indemnity. Moreover, he explains the matter to the minister’s\r\nwife, who never fails to draw freely upon the fund, and sometimes takes\r\nall, for the “outfit” is looked upon as a household affair. The cashier\r\nthen proceeds to turn a compliment, and to slip in a few politic\r\nphrases: “If his Excellency would deign to retain him; if, satisfied\r\nwith his purely mechanical services, he would,” etc. As a man who brings\r\ntwenty-five thousand francs is always a worthy official, the cashier is\r\nsure not to leave without his confirmation to the post from which he has\r\nseen a succession of ministers come and go during a period of, perhaps,\r\ntwenty-five years. His next step is to place himself at the orders of\r\nMadame; he brings the monthly thirteen thousand francs whenever wanted;\r\nhe advances or delays the payment as requested, and thus manages to\r\nobtain, as they said in the monasteries, a voice in the chapter.\r\n\r\nFormerly book-keeper at the Treasury, when that establishment kept its\r\nbooks by double entry, the Sieur Saillard was compensated for the loss\r\nof that position by his appointment as cashier of a ministry. He was a\r\nbulky, fat man, very strong in the matter of book-keeping, and very weak\r\nin everything else; round as a round O, simple as how-do-you-do,--a man\r\nwho came to his office with measured steps, like those of an elephant,\r\nand returned with the same measured tread to the place Royale, where he\r\nlived on the ground-floor of an old mansion belonging to him. He usually\r\nhad a companion on the way in the person of Monsieur Isidore Baudoyer,\r\nhead of a bureau in Monsieur de la Billardiere’s division, consequently\r\none of Rabourdin’s colleagues. Baudoyer was married to Elisabeth\r\nSaillard, the cashier’s only daughter, and had hired, very naturally,\r\nthe apartments above those of his father-in-law. No one at the ministry\r\nhad the slightest doubt that Saillard was a blockhead, but neither\r\nhad any one ever found out how far his stupidity could go; it was too\r\ncompact to be examined; it did not ring hollow; it absorbed everything\r\nand gave nothing out. Bixiou (a clerk of whom more anon) caricatured the\r\ncashier by drawing a head in a wig at the top of an egg, and two little\r\nlegs at the other end, with this inscription: “Born to pay out and take\r\nin without blundering. A little less luck, and he might have been lackey\r\nto the bank of France; a little more ambition, and he could have been\r\nhonorably discharged.”\r\n\r\nAt the moment of which we are now writing, the minister was looking\r\nat his cashier very much as we gaze at a window or a cornice, without\r\nsupposing that either can hear us, or fathom our secret thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I am all the more anxious that we should settle everything with the\r\nprefect in the quietest way, because des Lupeaulx has designs upon the\r\nplace for himself,” said the minister, continuing his talk with the\r\ndeputy; “his paltry little estate is in your arrondissement; we won’t\r\nwant him as deputy.”\r\n\r\n“He has neither years nor rentals enough to be eligible,” said the\r\ndeputy.\r\n\r\n“That may be; but you know how it was decided for Casimir Perier as\r\nto age; and as to worldly possessions, des Lupeaulx does possess\r\nsomething,--not much, it is true, but the law does not take into account\r\nincrease, which he may very well obtain; commissions have wide margins\r\nfor the deputies of the Centre, you know, and we cannot openly oppose\r\nthe good-will that is shown to this dear friend.”\r\n\r\n“But where would he get the money?”\r\n\r\n“How did Manuel manage to become the owner of a house in Paris?” cried\r\nthe minister.\r\n\r\nThe cashier listened and heard, but reluctantly and against his will.\r\nThese rapid remarks, murmured as they were, struck his ear by one of\r\nthose acoustic rebounds which are very little studied. As he heard these\r\npolitical confidences, however, a keen alarm took possession of his\r\nsoul. He was one of those simple-minded beings, who are shocked at\r\nlistening to anything they are not intended to hear, or entering where\r\nthey are not invited, and seeming bold when they are really timid,\r\ninquisitive where they are truly discreet. The cashier accordingly began\r\nto glide along the carpet and edge himself away, so that the minister\r\nsaw him at a distance when he first took notice of him. Saillard was a\r\nministerial henchman absolutely incapable of indiscretion; even if the\r\nminister had known that he had overheard a secret he had only to whisper\r\n“motus” in his ear to be sure it was perfectly safe. The cashier,\r\nhowever, took advantage of an influx of office-seekers, to slip out\r\nand get into his hackney-coach (hired by the hour for these costly\r\nentertainments), and to return to his home in the place Royale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE TEREDOS NAVALIS, OTHERWISE CALLED SHIP-WORM\r\n\r\nWhile old Saillard was driving across Paris his son-in-law, Isidore\r\nBaudoyer, and his daughter, Elisabeth, Baudoyer’s wife, were playing\r\na virtuous game of boston with their confessor, the Abbe Gaudron,\r\nin company with a few neighbors and a certain Martin Falleix, a\r\nbrass-founder in the fauborg Saint-Antoine, to whom Saillard had loaned\r\nthe necessary money to establish a business. This Falleix, a\r\nrespectable Auvergnat who had come to seek his fortune in Paris with his\r\nsmelting-pot on his back, had found immediate employment with the firm\r\nof Brezac, collectors of metals and other relics from all chateaux\r\nin the provinces. About twenty-seven years of age, and spoiled, like\r\nothers, by success, Martin Falleix had had the luck to become the active\r\nagent of Monsieur Saillard, the sleeping-partner in the working out of\r\na discovery made by Falleix in smelting (patent of invention and gold\r\nmedal granted at the exposition of 1825). Madame Baudoyer, whose only\r\ndaughter was treading--to use an expression of old Saillard’s--on the\r\ntail of her twelve years, laid claim to Falleix, a thickset, swarthy,\r\nactive young fellow, of shrewd principles, whose education she was\r\nsuperintending. The said education, according to her ideas, consisted in\r\nteaching him to play boston, to hold his cards properly, and not to let\r\nothers see his game; to shave himself regularly before he came to the\r\nhouse, and to wash his hands with good cleansing soap; not to swear, to\r\nspeak her kind of French, to wear boots instead of shoes, cotton shirts\r\ninstead of sacking, and to brush up his hair instead of plastering\r\nit flat. During the preceding week Elisabeth had finally succeeded in\r\npersuading Falleix to give up wearing a pair of enormous flat earrings\r\nresembling hoops.\r\n\r\n“You go too far, Madame Baudoyer,” he said, seeing her satisfaction at\r\nthe final sacrifice; “you order me about too much. You make me clean my\r\nteeth, which loosens them; presently you will want me to brush my nails\r\nand curl my hair, which won’t do at all in our business; we don’t like\r\ndandies.”\r\n\r\nElisabeth Baudoyer, nee Saillard, is one of those persons who escape\r\nportraiture through their utter commonness; yet who ought to be\r\nsketched, because they are specimens of that second-rate Parisian\r\nbourgeoisie which occupies a place above the well-to-do artisan and\r\nbelow the upper middle classes,--a tribe whose virtues are well-nigh\r\nvices, whose defects are never kindly, but whose habits and manners,\r\ndull and insipid though they be, are not without a certain originality.\r\nSomething pinched and puny about Elisabeth Saillard was painful to the\r\neye. Her figure, scarcely over four feet in height, was so thin that\r\nthe waist measured less than twenty inches. Her small features, which\r\nclustered close about the nose, gave her face a vague resemblance to a\r\nweasel’s snout. Though she was past thirty years old she looked scarcely\r\nmore than sixteen. Her eyes, of porcelain blue, overweighted by heavy\r\neyelids which fell nearly straight from the arch of the eyebrows, had\r\nlittle light in them. Everything about her appearance was commonplace:\r\nwitness her flaxen hair, tending to whiteness; her flat forehead, from\r\nwhich the light did not reflect; and her dull complexion, with gray,\r\nalmost leaden, tones. The lower part of the face, more triangular than\r\noval, ended irregularly the otherwise irregular outline of her face.\r\nHer voice had a rather pretty range of intonation, from sharp to sweet.\r\nElisabeth was a perfect specimen of the second-rate little bourgeoisie\r\nwho lectures her husband behind the curtains; obtains no credit for her\r\nvirtues; is ambitious without intelligent object, and solely through the\r\ndevelopment of her domestic selfishness. Had she lived in the country\r\nshe would have bought up adjacent land; being, as she was, connected\r\nwith the administration, she was determined to push her way. If we\r\nrelate the life of her father and mother, we shall show the sort of\r\nwoman she was by a picture of her childhood and youth.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Saillard married the daughter of an upholsterer keeping shop\r\nunder the arcades of the Market. Limited means compelled Monsieur and\r\nMadame Saillard at their start in life to bear constant privation. After\r\nthirty-three years of married life, and twenty-nine years of toil in\r\na government office, the property of “the Saillards”--their circle\r\nof acquaintance called them so--consisted of sixty thousand francs\r\nentrusted to Falleix, the house in the place Royale, bought for forty\r\nthousand in 1804, and thirty-six thousand francs given in dowry to their\r\ndaughter Elisabeth. Out of this capital about fifty thousand came\r\nto them by the will of the widow Bidault, Madame Saillard’s mother.\r\nSaillard’s salary from the government had always been four thousand five\r\nhundred francs a year, and no more; his situation was a blind alley\r\nthat led nowhere, and had tempted no one to supersede him. Those ninety\r\nthousand francs, put together sou by sou, were the fruit therefore of a\r\nsordid economy unintelligently employed. In fact, the Saillards did\r\nnot know how better to manage their savings than to carry them, five\r\nthousand francs at a time, to their notary, Monsieur Sorbier, Cardot’s\r\npredecessor, and let him invest them at five per cent in first\r\nmortgages, with the wife’s rights reserved in case the borrower was\r\nmarried! In 1804 Madame Saillard obtained a government office for the\r\nsale of stamped papers, a circumstance which brought a servant into the\r\nhousehold for the first time. At the time of which we write, the house,\r\nwhich was worth a hundred thousand francs, brought in a rental of eight\r\nthousand. Falleix paid seven per cent for the sixty thousand invested\r\nin the foundry, besides an equal division of profits. The Saillards were\r\ntherefore enjoying an income of not less than seventeen thousand francs\r\na year. The whole ambition of the good man now centred on obtaining the\r\ncross of the Legion and his retiring pension.\r\n\r\nElisabeth, the only child, had toiled steadily from infancy in a home\r\nwhere the customs of life were rigid and the ideas simple. A new hat for\r\nSaillard was a matter of deliberation; the time a coat could last was\r\nestimated and discussed; umbrellas were carefully hung up by means of\r\na brass buckle. Since 1804 no repairs of any kind had been done to the\r\nhouse. The Saillards kept the ground-floor in precisely the state in\r\nwhich their predecessor left it. The gilding of the pier-glasses was\r\nrubbed off; the paint on the cornices was hardly visible through the\r\nlayers of dust that time had collected. The fine large rooms still\r\nretained certain sculptured marble mantel-pieces and ceilings, worthy\r\nof Versailles, together with the old furniture of the widow Bidault. The\r\nlatter consisted of a curious mixture of walnut armchairs, disjointed,\r\nand covered with tapestry; rosewood bureaus; round tables on single\r\npedestals, with brass railings and cracked marble tops; one superb\r\nBoulle secretary, the value of which style had not yet been recognized;\r\nin short, a chaos of bargains picked up by the worthy widow,--pictures\r\nbought for the sake of the frames, china services of a composite order;\r\nto wit, a magnificent Japanese dessert set, and all the rest porcelains\r\nof various makes, unmatched silver plate, old glass, fine damask, and a\r\nfour-post bedstead, hung with curtains and garnished with plumes.\r\n\r\nAmid these curious relics, Madame Saillard always sat on a sofa of\r\nmodern mahogany, near a fireplace full of ashes and without fire, on the\r\nmantel-shelf of which stood a clock, some antique bronzes, candelabra\r\nwith paper flowers but no candles, for the careful housewife lighted the\r\nroom with a tall tallow candle always guttering down into the flat brass\r\ncandlestick which held it. Madame Saillard’s face, despite its wrinkles,\r\nwas expressive of obstinacy and severity, narrowness of ideas, an\r\nuprightness that might be called quadrangular, a religion without piety,\r\nstraightforward, candid avarice, and the peace of a quiet conscience.\r\nYou may see in certain Flemish pictures the wives of burgomasters cut\r\nout by nature on the same pattern and wonderfully reproduced on canvas;\r\nbut these dames wear fine robes of velvet and precious stuffs, whereas\r\nMadame Saillard possessed no robes, only that venerable garment called\r\nin Touraine and Picardy “cottes,” elsewhere petticoats, or skirts\r\npleated behind and on each side, with other skirts hanging over them.\r\nHer bust was inclosed in what was called a “casaquin,” another obsolete\r\nname for a short gown or jacket. She continued to wear a cap with\r\nstarched wings, and shoes with high heels. Though she was now\r\nfifty-seven years old, and her lifetime of vigorous household work ought\r\nnow to be rewarded with well-earned repose, she was incessantly employed\r\nin knitting her husband’s stockings and her own, and those of an uncle,\r\njust as her countrywomen knit them, moving about the room, talking,\r\npacing up and down the garden, or looking round the kitchen to watch\r\nwhat was going on.\r\n\r\nThe Saillard’s avarice, which was really imposed on them in the first\r\ninstance by dire necessity, was now a second nature. When the cashier\r\ngot back from the office, he laid aside his coat, and went to work in\r\nthe large garden, shut off from the courtyard by an iron railing, and\r\nwhich the family reserved to itself. For years Elisabeth, the daughter,\r\nwent to market every morning with her mother, and the two did all\r\nthe work of the house. The mother cooked well, especially a duck with\r\nturnips; but, according to Saillard, no one could equal Elisabeth in\r\nhashing the remains of a leg of mutton with onions. “You might eat\r\nyour boots with those onions and not know it,” he remarked. As soon\r\nas Elisabeth knew how to hold a needle, her mother had her mend the\r\nhousehold linen and her father’s coats. Always at work, like a servant,\r\nshe never went out alone. Though living close by the boulevard du\r\nTemple, where Franconi, La Gaite, and l’Ambigu-Comique were within a\r\nstone’s throw, and, further on, the Porte-Saint-Martin, Elisabeth had\r\nnever seen a comedy. When she asked to “see what it was like” (with the\r\nAbbe Gaudron’s permission, be it understood), Monsieur Baudoyer took\r\nher--for the glory of the thing, and to show her the finest that was to\r\nbe seen--to the Opera, where they were playing “The Chinese Laborer.”\r\n Elisabeth thought “the comedy” as wearisome as the plague of flies, and\r\nnever wished to see another. On Sundays, after walking four times to\r\nand fro between the place Royale and Saint-Paul’s church (for her mother\r\nmade her practise the precepts and the duties of religion), her parents\r\ntook her to the pavement in front of the Cafe Ture, where they sat on\r\nchairs placed between a railing and the wall. The Saillards always made\r\nhaste to reach the place early so as to choose the best seats, and found\r\nmuch entertainment in watching the passers-by. In those days the Cafe\r\nTure was the rendezvous of the fashionable society of the Marais, the\r\nfaubourg Saint-Antoine, and the circumjacent regions.\r\n\r\nElisabeth never wore anything but cotton gowns in summer and merino in\r\nthe winter, which she made herself. Her mother gave her twenty francs\r\na month for her expenses, but her father, who was very fond of her,\r\nmitigated this rigorous treatment with a few presents. She never read\r\nwhat the Abbe Gaudron, vicar of Saint-Paul’s and the family director,\r\ncalled profane books. This discipline had borne fruit. Forced to employ\r\nher feelings on some passion or other, Elisabeth became eager after\r\ngain. Though she was not lacking in sense or perspicacity, religious\r\ntheories, and her complete ignorance of higher emotions had encircled\r\nall her faculties with an iron hand; they were exercised solely on the\r\ncommonest things of life; spent in a few directions they were able\r\nto concentrate themselves on a matter in hand. Repressed by religious\r\ndevotion, her natural intelligence exercised itself within the limits\r\nmarked out by cases of conscience, which form a mine of subtleties\r\namong which self-interest selects its subterfuges. Like those saintly\r\npersonages in whom religion does not stifle ambition, Elisabeth was\r\ncapable of requiring others to do a blamable action that she might reap\r\nthe fruits; and she would have been, like them again, implacable as to\r\nher dues and dissembling in her actions. Once offended, she watched her\r\nadversaries with the perfidious patience of a cat, and was capable of\r\nbringing about some cold and complete vengeance, and then laying it to\r\nthe account of God. Until her marriage the Saillards lived without other\r\nsociety than that of the Abbe Gaudron, a priest from Auvergne appointed\r\nvicar of Saint-Paul’s after the restoration of Catholic worship. Besides\r\nthis ecclesiastic, who was a friend of the late Madame Bidault, a\r\npaternal uncle of Madame Saillard, an old paper-dealer retired from\r\nbusiness ever since the year II. of the Republic, and now sixty-nine\r\nyears old, came to see them on Sundays only, because on that day no\r\ngovernment business went on.\r\n\r\nThis little old man, with a livid face blazoned by the red nose of a\r\ntippler and lighted by two gleaming vulture eyes, allowed his gray hair\r\nto hang loose under a three-cornered hat, wore breeches with straps that\r\nextended beyond the buckles, cotton stockings of mottled thread knitted\r\nby his niece, whom he always called “the little Saillard,” stout shoes\r\nwith silver buckles, and a surtout coat of mixed colors. He looked very\r\nmuch like those verger-beadle-bell-ringing-grave-digging-parish-clerks\r\nwho are taken to be caricatures until we see them performing their\r\nvarious functions. On the present occasion he had come on foot to dine\r\nwith the Saillards, intending to return in the same way to the rue\r\nGreneta, where he lived on the third floor of an old house. His business\r\nwas that of discounting commercial paper in the quartier Saint-Martin,\r\nwhere he was known by the nickname of “Gigonnet,” from the nervous\r\nconvulsive movement with which he lifted his legs in walking, like a\r\ncat. Monsieur Bidault began this business in the year II. in partnership\r\nwith a dutchman named Werbrust, a friend of Gobseck.\r\n\r\nSome time later Saillard made the acquaintance of Monsieur and Madame\r\nTranson, wholesale dealers in pottery, with an establishment in the rue\r\nde Lesdiguieres, who took an interest in Elisabeth and introduced young\r\nIsadore Baudoyer to the family with the intention of marrying her.\r\nGigonnet approved of the match, for he had long employed a certain\r\nMitral, uncle of the young man, as clerk. Monsieur and Madame Baudoyer,\r\nfather and mother of Isidore, highly respected leather-dressers in the\r\nrue Censier, had slowly made a moderate fortune out of a small trade.\r\nAfter marrying their only son, on whom they settled fifty thousand\r\nfrancs, they determined to live in the country, and had lately removed\r\nto the neighborhood of Ile-d’Adam, where after a time they were joined\r\nby Mitral. They frequently came to Paris, however, where they kept a\r\ncorner in the house in the rue Censier which they gave to Isidore on\r\nhis marriage. The elder Baudoyers had an income of about three thousand\r\nfrancs left to live upon after establishing their son.\r\n\r\nMitral was a being with a sinister wig, a face the color of Seine water,\r\nlighted by a pair of Spanish-tobacco-colored eyes, cold as a well-rope,\r\nalways smelling a rat, and close-mouthed about his property. He probably\r\nmade his fortune in his own hole and corner, just as Werbrust and\r\nGigonnet made theirs in the quartier Saint-Martin.\r\n\r\nThough the Saillards’ circle of acquaintance increased, neither their\r\nideas nor their manners and customs changed. The saint’s-days of father,\r\nmother, daughter, son-in-law, and grandchild were carefully observed,\r\nalso the anniversaries of birth and marriage, Easter, Christmas,\r\nNew Year’s day, and Epiphany. These festivals were preceded by great\r\ndomestic sweepings and a universal clearing up of the house, which added\r\nan element of usefulness to the ceremonies. When the festival day\r\ncame, the presents were offered with much pomp and an accompaniment of\r\nflowers,--silk stockings or a fur cap for old Saillard; gold earrings\r\nand articles of plate for Elisabeth or her husband, for whom, little\r\nby little, the parents were accumulating a whole silver service; silk\r\npetticoats for Madame Saillard, who laid the stuff by and never made it\r\nup. The recipient of these gifts was placed in an armchair and asked\r\nby those present for a certain length of time, “Guess what we have for\r\nyou!” Then came a splendid dinner, lasting at least five hours, to which\r\nwere invited the Abbe Gaudron, Falleix, Rabourdin, Monsieur Godard,\r\nunder-head-clerk to Monsieur Baudoyer, Monsieur Bataille, captain of\r\nthe company of the National Guard to which Saillard and his son-in-law\r\nbelonged. Monsieur Cardot, who was invariably asked, did as Rabourdin\r\ndid, namely, accepted one invitation out of six. The company sang at\r\ndessert, shook hands and embraced with enthusiasm, wishing each other\r\nall manner of happiness; the presents were exhibited and the opinion of\r\nthe guests asked about them. The day Saillard received his fur cap\r\nhe wore it during the dessert, to the satisfaction of all present. At\r\nnight, mere ordinary acquaintances were bidden, and dancing went on till\r\nvery late, formerly to the music of one violin, but for the last six\r\nyears Monsieur Godard, who was a great flute player, contributed\r\nthe piercing tones of a flageolet to the festivity. The cook, Madame\r\nBaudoyer’s nurse, and old Catherine, Madame Saillard’s woman-servant,\r\ntogether with the porter or his wife, stood looking on at the door of\r\nthe salon. The servants always received three francs on these occasions\r\nto buy themselves wine or coffee.\r\n\r\nThis little circle looked upon Saillard and Baudoyer as transcendent\r\nbeings; they were government officers; they had risen by their own\r\nmerits; they worked, it was said, with the minister himself; they owed\r\ntheir fortune to their talents; they were politicians. Baudoyer was\r\nconsidered the more able of the two; his position as head of a bureau\r\npresupposed labor that was more intricate and arduous than that of a\r\ncashier. Moreover, Isidore, though the son of a leather-dresser, had had\r\nthe genius to study and to cast aside his father’s business and find a\r\ncareer in politics, which had led him to a post of eminence. In short,\r\nsilent and uncommunicative as he was, he was looked upon as a deep\r\nthinker, and perhaps, said the admiring circle, he would some day\r\nbecome deputy of the eighth arrondissement. As Gigonnet listened to such\r\nremarks as these, he pressed his already pinched lips closer together,\r\nand threw a glance at his great-niece, Elisabeth.\r\n\r\nIn person, Isidore was a tall, stout man of thirty-seven, who perspired\r\nfreely, and whose head looked as if he had water on the brain. This\r\nenormous head, covered with chestnut hair cropped close, was joined to\r\nthe neck by rolls of flesh which overhung the collar of his coat. He had\r\nthe arms of Hercules, hands worthy of Domitian, a stomach which\r\nsobriety held within the limits of the majestic, to use a saying of\r\nBrillaet-Savarin. His face was a good deal like that of the Emperor\r\nAlexander. The Tartar type was in the little eyes and the flattened nose\r\nturned slightly up, in the frigid lips and the short chin. The forehead\r\nwas low and narrow. Though his temperament was lymphatic, the devout\r\nIsidore was under the influence of a conjugal passion which time did not\r\nlessen.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of his resemblance to the handsome Russian Emperor\r\nand the terrible Domitian, Isidore Baudoyer was nothing more than a\r\npolitical office-holder, of little ability as head of his department, a\r\ncut-and-dried routine man, who concealed the fact that he was a flabby\r\ncipher by so ponderous a personality that no scalpel could cut deep\r\nenough to let the operator see into him. His severe studies, in which\r\nhe had shown the patience and sagacity of an ox, and his square head,\r\ndeceived his parents, who firmly believed him an extraordinary man.\r\nPedantic and hypercritical, meddlesome and fault-finding, he was a\r\nterror to the clerks under him, whom he worried in their work,\r\nenforcing the rules rigorously, and arriving himself with such terrible\r\npunctuality that not one of them dared to be a moment late. Baudoyer\r\nwore a blue coat with gilt buttons, a chamois waistcoat, gray trousers\r\nand cravats of various colors. His feet were large and ill-shod. From\r\nthe chain of his watch depended an enormous bunch of old trinkets, among\r\nwhich in 1824 he still wore “American beads,” which were very much the\r\nfashion in the year VII.\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of this family, bound together by the force of religious\r\nties, by the inflexibility of its customs, by one solitary emotion, that\r\nof avarice, a passion which was now as it were its compass, Elisabeth\r\nwas forced to commune with herself, instead of imparting her ideas to\r\nthose around her, for she felt herself without equals in mind who could\r\ncomprehend her. Though facts compelled her to judge her husband, her\r\nreligious duty led her to keep up as best she could a favorable opinion\r\nof him; she showed him marked respect; honored him as the father of her\r\nchild, her husband, the temporal power, as the vicar of Saint-Paul’s\r\ntold her. She would have thought it a mortal sin to make a single\r\ngesture, or give a single glance, or say a single word which would\r\nreveal to others her real opinion of the imbecile Baudoyer. She even\r\nprofessed to obey passively all his wishes. But her ears were receptive\r\nof many things; she thought them over, weighed and compared them in the\r\nsolitude of her mind, and judged so soberly of men and events that at\r\nthe time when our history begins she was the hidden oracle of the two\r\nfunctionaries, her husband and father, who had, unconsciously, come\r\nto do nothing whatever without consulting her. Old Saillard would say,\r\ninnocently, “Isn’t she clever, that Elisabeth of mine?” But Baudoyer,\r\ntoo great a fool not to be puffed up by the false reputation the\r\nquartier Saint-Antoine bestowed upon him, denied his wife’s cleverness\r\nall the while that he was making use of it.\r\n\r\nElisabeth had long felt sure that her uncle Bidault, otherwise called\r\nGigonnet, was rich and handled vast sums of money. Enlightened by\r\nself-interest, she had come to understand Monsieur des Lupeaulx far\r\nbetter than the minister understood him. Finding herself married to\r\na fool, she never allowed herself to think that life might have gone\r\nbetter with her, she only imagined the possibility of better things\r\nwithout expecting or wishing to attain them. All her best affections\r\nfound their vocation in her love for her daughter, to whom she spared\r\nthe pains and privations she had borne in her own childhood; she\r\nbelieved that in this affection she had her full share in the world of\r\nfeeling. Solely for her daughter’s sake she had persuaded her father to\r\ntake the important step of going into partnership with Falleix. Falleix\r\nhad been brought to the Saillard’s house by old Bidault, who lent\r\nhim money on his merchandise. Falleix thought his old countryman\r\nextortionate, and complained to the Saillards that Gigonnet demanded\r\neighteen per cent from an Auvergnat. Madame Saillard ventured to\r\nremonstrate with her uncle.\r\n\r\n“It is just because he is an Auvergnat that I take only eighteen per\r\ncent,” said Gigonnet, when she spoke of him.\r\n\r\nFalleix, who had made a discovery at the age of twenty-eight, and\r\ncommunicated it to Saillard, seemed to carry his heart in his hand (an\r\nexpression of old Saillard’s), and also seemed likely to make a great\r\nfortune. Elisabeth determined to husband him for her daughter and train\r\nhim herself, having, as she calculated, seven years to do it in. Martin\r\nFalleix felt and showed the deepest respect for Madame Baudoyer, whose\r\nsuperior qualities he was able to recognize. If he were fated to make\r\nmillions he would always belong to her family, where he had found a\r\nhome. The little Baudoyer girl was already trained to bring him his tea\r\nand to take his hat.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of which we write, Monsieur Saillard, returning from the\r\nministry, found a game of boston in full blast; Elisabeth was advising\r\nFalleix how to play; Madame Saillard was knitting in the chimney-corner\r\nand overlooking the cards of the vicar; Monsieur Baudoyer, motionless as\r\na mile-stone, was employing his mental capacity in calculating how the\r\ncards were placed, and sat opposite to Mitral, who had come up from\r\nIle-d’Adam for the Christmas holidays. No one moved as the cashier\r\nentered, and for some minutes he walked up and down the room, his fat\r\nface contracted with unaccustomed thought.\r\n\r\n“He is always so when he dines at the ministry,” remarked Madame\r\nSaillard; “happily, it is only twice a year, or he’d die of it. Saillard\r\nwas never made to be in the government--Well, now, I do hope, Saillard,”\r\n she continued in a loud tone, “that you are not going to keep on those\r\nsilk breeches and that handsome coat. Go and take them off; don’t wear\r\nthem at home, my man.”\r\n\r\n“Your father has something on his mind,” said Baudoyer to his wife, when\r\nthe cashier was in his bedroom, undressing without any fire.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps Monsieur de la Billardiere is dead,” said Elisabeth, simply;\r\n“and as he is anxious you should have the place, it worries him.”\r\n\r\n“Can I be useful in any way?” said the vicar of Saint-Paul’s; “if\r\nso, pray use my services. I have the honor to be known to Madame la\r\nDauphine. These are days when public offices should be given only to\r\nfaithful men, whose religious principles are not to be shaken.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” said Falleix, “do men of merit need protectors and influence\r\nto get places in the government service? I am glad I am an iron-master;\r\nmy customers know where to find a good article--”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” interrupted Baudoyer, “the government is the government;\r\nnever attack it in this house.”\r\n\r\n“You speak like the ‘Constitutionel,’” said the vicar.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Constitutionel’ never says anything different from that,” replied\r\nBaudoyer, who never read it.\r\n\r\nThe cashier believed his son-in-law to be as superior in talent\r\nto Rabourdin as God was greater than Saint-Crepin, to use his\r\nown expression; but the good man coveted this appointment in a\r\nstraightforward, honest way. Influenced by the feeling which leads all\r\nofficials to seek promotion,--a violent, unreflecting, almost brutal\r\npassion,--he desired success, just as he desired the cross of the Legion\r\nof honor, without doing anything against his conscience to obtain it,\r\nand solely, as he believed, on the strength of his son-in-law’s merits.\r\nTo his thinking, a man who had patiently spent twenty-five years in a\r\ngovernment office behind an iron railing had sacrificed himself to his\r\ncountry and deserved the cross. But all that he dreamed of doing to\r\npromote his son-in-law’s appointment in La Billardiere’s place was to\r\nsay a word to his Excellency’s wife when he took her the month’s salary.\r\n\r\n“Well, Saillard, you look as if you had lost all your friends! Do speak;\r\ndo, pray, tell us something,” cried his wife when he came back into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nSaillard, after making a little sign to his daughter, turned on his heel\r\nto keep himself from talking politics before strangers. When Monsieur\r\nMitral and the vicar had departed, Saillard rolled back the card-table\r\nand sat down in an armchair in the attitude he always assumed when about\r\nto tell some office-gossip,--a series of movements which answered the\r\npurpose of the three knocks given at the Theatre-Francais. After binding\r\nhis wife, daughter, and son-in-law to the deepest secrecy,--for,\r\nhowever petty the gossip, their places, as he thought, depended on their\r\ndiscretion,--he related the incomprehensible enigma of the resignation\r\nof a deputy, the very legitimate desire of the general-secretary to get\r\nelected to the place, and the secret opposition of the minister to this\r\nwish of a man who was one of his firmest supporters and most zealous\r\nworkers. This, of course, brought down an avalanche of suppositions,\r\nflooded with the sapient arguments of the two officials, who sent back\r\nand forth to each other a wearisome flood of nonsense. Elisabeth quietly\r\nasked three questions:--\r\n\r\n“If Monsieur des Lupeaulx is on our side, will Monsieur Baudoyer be\r\nappointed in Monsieur de la Billardiere’s place?”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! I should think so,” cried the cashier.\r\n\r\n“My uncle Bidault and Monsieur Gobseck helped in him 1814,” thought she.\r\n“Is he in debt?” she asked, aloud.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried the cashier with a hissing and prolonged sound on the last\r\nletter; “his salary was attached, but some of the higher powers released\r\nit by a bill at sight.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the des Lupeaulx estate?”\r\n\r\n“Why, don’t you know? in the part of the country where your grandfather\r\nand your great-uncle Bidault belong, in the arrondissement of the deputy\r\nwho wants to resign.”\r\n\r\nWhen her colossus of a husband had gone to bed, Elisabeth leaned over\r\nhim, and though he always treated her remarks as women’s nonsense, she\r\nsaid, “Perhaps you will really get Monsieur de la Billardiere’s place.”\r\n\r\n“There you go with your imaginations!” said Baudoyer; “leave Monsieur\r\nGaudron to speak to the Dauphine and don’t meddle with politics.”\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock, when all were asleep in the place Royale, Monsieur\r\ndes Lupeaulx was leaving the Opera for the rue Duphot. This particular\r\nWednesday was one of Madame Rabourdin’s most brilliant evenings. Many of\r\nher customary guests came in from the theatres and swelled the company\r\nalready assembled, among whom were several celebrities, such as: Canalis\r\nthe poet, Schinner the painter, Dr. Bianchon, Lucien de Rubempre, Octave\r\nde Camps, the Comte de Granville, the Vicomte de Fontaine, du Bruel the\r\nvaudevillist, Andoche Finot the journalist, Derville, one of the best\r\nheads in the law courts, the Comte du Chatelet, deputy, du Tillet,\r\nbanker, and several elegant young men, such as Paul de Manerville and\r\nthe Vicomte de Portenduere. Celestine was pouring out tea when the\r\ngeneral-secretary entered. Her dress that evening was very becoming;\r\nshe wore a black velvet robe without ornament of any kind, a black gauze\r\nscarf, her hair smoothly bound about her head and raised in a heavy\r\nbraided mass, with long curls a l’Anglaise falling on either side of her\r\nface. The charms which particularly distinguished this woman were the\r\nItalian ease of her artistic nature, her ready comprehension, and the\r\ngrace with which she welcomed and promoted the least appearance of a\r\nwish on the part of others. Nature had given her an elegant, slender\r\nfigure, which could sway lightly at a word, black eyes of oriental\r\nshape, able, like those of the Chinese women, to see out of their\r\ncorners. She well knew how to manage a soft, insinuating voice, which\r\nthrew a tender charm into every word, even such as she merely chanced\r\nto utter; her feet were like those we see in portraits where the painter\r\nboldly lies and flatters his sitter in the only way which does not\r\ncompromise anatomy. Her complexion, a little yellow by day, like that\r\nof most brunettes, was dazzling at night under the wax candles, which\r\nbrought out the brilliancy of her black hair and eyes. Her slender and\r\nwell-defined outlines reminded an artist of the Venus of the Middle Ages\r\nrendered by Jean Goujon, the illustrious sculptor of Diane de Poitiers.\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx stopped in the doorway, and leaned against the woodwork.\r\nThis ferret of ideas did not deny himself the pleasure of spying upon\r\nsentiment, and this woman interested him more than any of the others to\r\nwhom he had attached himself. Des Lupeaulx had reached an age when men\r\nassert pretensions in regard to women. The first white hairs lead to\r\nthe latest passions, all the more violent because they are astride of\r\nvanishing powers and dawning weakness. The age of forty is the age\r\nof folly,--an age when man wants to be loved for himself; whereas at\r\ntwenty-five life is so full that he has no wants. At twenty-five he\r\noverflows with vigor and wastes it with impunity, but at forty he learns\r\nthat to use it in that way is to abuse it. The thoughts that came into\r\ndes Lupeaulx’s mind at this moment were melancholy ones. The nerves of\r\nthe old beau relaxed; the agreeable smile, which served as a mask and\r\nmade the character of his countenance, faded; the real man appeared, and\r\nhe was horrible. Rabourdin caught sight of him and thought, “What has\r\nhappened to him? can he be disgraced in any way?” The general-secretary\r\nwas, however, only thinking how the pretty Madame Colleville, whose\r\nintentions were exactly those of Madame Rabourdin, had summarily\r\nabandoned him when it suited her to do so. Rabourdin caught the sham\r\nstatesman’s eyes fixed on his wife, and he recorded the look in his\r\nmemory. He was too keen an observer not to understand des Lupeaulx to\r\nthe bottom, and he deeply despised him; but, as with most busy men,\r\nhis feelings and sentiments seldom came to the surface. Absorption in a\r\nbeloved work is practically equivalent to the cleverest dissimulation,\r\nand thus it was that the opinions and ideas of Rabourdin were a sealed\r\nbook to des Lupeaulx. The former was sorry to see the man in his house,\r\nbut he was never willing to oppose his wife’s wishes. At this particular\r\nmoment, while he talked confidentially with a supernumerary of his\r\noffice who was destined, later, to play an unconscious part in a\r\npolitical intrigue resulting from the death of La Billardiere, he\r\nwatched, though half-abstractedly, his wife and des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\nHere we must explain, as much for foreigners as for our own\r\ngrandchildren, what a supernumerary in a government office in Paris\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nThe supernumerary is to the administration what a choir-boy is to a\r\nchurch, what the company’s child is to the regiment, what the figurante\r\nis to a theatre; something artless, naive, innocent, a being blinded by\r\nillusions. Without illusions what would become of any of us? They give\r\nstrength to bear the res angusta domi of arts and the beginnings of all\r\nscience by inspiring us with faith. Illusion is illimitable faith. Now\r\nthe supernumerary has faith in the administration; he never thinks\r\nit cold, cruel, and hard, as it really is. There are two kinds of\r\nsupernumeraries, or hangers-on,--one poor, the other rich. The poor one\r\nis rich in hope and wants a place, the rich one is poor in spirit and\r\nwants nothing. A wealthy family is not so foolish as to put its able\r\nmen into the administration. It confides an unfledged scion to some\r\nhead-clerk, or gives him in charge of a directory who initiates him into\r\nwhat Bilboquet, that profound philosopher, called the high comedy of\r\ngovernment; he is spared all the horrors of drudgery and is finally\r\nappointed to some important office. The rich supernumerary never alarms\r\nthe other clerks; they know he does not endanger their interests, for he\r\nseeks only the highest posts in the administration. About the period of\r\nwhich we write many families were saying to themselves: “What can we do\r\nwith our sons?” The army no longer offered a chance for fortune. Special\r\ncareers, such as civil and military engineering, the navy, mining, and\r\nthe professorial chair were all fenced about by strict regulations or\r\nto be obtained only by competition; whereas in the civil service\r\nthe revolving wheel which turned clerks into prefects, sub-prefects,\r\nassessors, and collectors, like the figures in a magic lantern, was\r\nsubjected to no such rules and entailed no drudgery. Through this easy\r\ngap emerged into life the rich supernumeraries who drove their tilburys,\r\ndressed well, and wore moustachios, all of them as impudent as parvenus.\r\nJournalists were apt to persecute the tribe, who were cousins, nephews,\r\nbrothers, or other relatives of some minister, some deputy, or an\r\ninfluential peer. The humbler clerks regarded them as a means of\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe poor supernumerary, on the other hand, who is the only real worker,\r\nis almost always the son of some former clerk’s widow, who lives on a\r\nmeagre pension and sacrifices herself to support her son until he can\r\nget a place as copying-clerk, and then dies leaving him no nearer the\r\nhead of his department than writer of deeds, order-clerks, or, possibly,\r\nunder-head-clerk. Living always in some locality where rents are low,\r\nthis humble supernumerary starts early from home. For him the Eastern\r\nquestion relates only to the morning skies. To go on foot and not get\r\nmuddied, to save his clothes, and allow for the time he may lose in\r\nstanding under shelter during a shower, are the preoccupations of\r\nhis mind. The street pavements, the flaggings of the quays and the\r\nboulevards, when first laid down, were a boon to him. If, for some\r\nextraordinary reason, you happen to be in the streets of Paris at\r\nhalf-past seven or eight o’clock of a winter’s morning, and see through\r\npiercing cold or fog or rain a timid, pale young man loom up, cigarless,\r\ntake notice of his pockets. You will be sure to see the outline of\r\na roll which his mother has given him to stay his stomach between\r\nbreakfast and dinner. The guilelessness of the supernumerary does not\r\nlast long. A youth enlightened by gleams by Parisian life soon measures\r\nthe frightful distance that separates him from the head-clerkship, a\r\ndistance which no mathematician, neither Archimedes, nor Leibnitz, nor\r\nLaplace has ever reckoned, the distance that exists between 0 and the\r\nfigure 1. He begins to perceive the impossibilities of his career; he\r\nhears talk of favoritism; he discovers the intrigues of officials: he\r\nsees the questionable means by which his superiors have pushed their\r\nway,--one has married a young woman who made a false step; another, the\r\nnatural daughter of a minister; this one shouldered the responsibility\r\nof another’s fault; that one, full of talent, risks his health in doing,\r\nwith the perseverance of a mole, prodigies of work which the man of\r\ninfluence feels incapable of doing for himself, though he takes the\r\ncredit. Everything is known in a government office. The incapable man\r\nhas a wife with a clear head, who has pushed him along and got him\r\nnominated for deputy; if he has not talent enough for an office, he\r\ncabals in the Chamber. The wife of another has a statesman at her feet.\r\nA third is the hidden informant of a powerful journalist. Often the\r\ndisgusted and hopeless supernumerary sends in his resignation. About\r\nthree fourths of his class leave the government employ without ever\r\nobtaining an appointment, and their number is winnowed down to\r\neither those young men who are foolish or obstinate enough to say to\r\nthemselves, “I have been here three years, and I must end sooner or\r\nlater by getting a place,” or to those who are conscious of a vocation\r\nfor the work. Undoubtedly the position of supernumerary in a government\r\noffice is precisely what the novitiate is in a religious order,--a\r\ntrial. It is a rough trial. The State discovers how many of them can\r\nbear hunger, thirst, and penury without breaking down, how many can toil\r\nwithout revolting against it; it learns which temperaments can bear\r\nup under the horrible experience--or if you like, the disease--of\r\ngovernment official life. From this point of view the apprenticeship of\r\nthe supernumerary, instead of being an infamous device of the government\r\nto obtain labor gratis, becomes a useful institution.\r\n\r\nThe young man with whom Rabourdin was talking was a poor supernumerary\r\nnamed Sebastien de la Roche, who had picked his way on the points of his\r\ntoes, without incurring the least splash upon his boots, from the rue du\r\nRoi-Dore in the Marais. He talked of his mamma, and dared not raise his\r\neyes to Madame Rabourdin, whose house appeared to him as gorgeous as\r\nthe Louvre. He was careful to show his gloves, well cleaned with\r\nindia-rubber, as little as he could. His poor mother had put five francs\r\nin his pocket in case it became absolutely necessary that he should play\r\ncards; but she enjoined him to take nothing, to remain standing, and\r\nto be very careful not to knock over a lamp or the bric-a-brac from an\r\netagere. His dress was all of the strictest black. His fair face, his\r\neyes, of a fine shade of green with golden reflections, were in keeping\r\nwith a handsome head of auburn hair. The poor lad looked furtively at\r\nMadame Rabourdin, whispering to himself, “How beautiful!” and was likely\r\nto dream of that fairy when he went to bed.\r\n\r\nRabourdin had noted a vocation for his work in the lad, and as he\r\nhimself took the whole service seriously, he felt a lively interest in\r\nhim. He guessed the poverty of his mother’s home, kept together on a\r\nwidow’s pension of seven hundred francs a year--for the education of\r\nthe son, who was just out of college, had absorbed all her savings. He\r\ntherefore treated the youth almost paternally; often endeavoured to\r\nget him some fee from the Council, or paid it from his own pocket. He\r\noverwhelmed Sebastien with work, trained him, and allowed him to do the\r\nwork of du Bruel’s place, for which that vaudevillist, otherwise known\r\nas Cursy, paid him three hundred francs out of his salary. In the minds\r\nof Madame de la Roche and her son, Rabourdin was at once a great man, a\r\ntyrant, and an angel. On him all the poor fellow’s hopes of getting an\r\nappointment depended, and the lad’s devotion to his chief was boundless.\r\nHe dined once a fortnight in the rue Duphot; but always at a family\r\ndinner, invited by Rabourdin himself; Madame asked him to evening\r\nparties only when she wanted partners.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Rabourdin was scolding poor Sebastien, the only human\r\nbeing who was in the secret of his immense labors. The youth copied and\r\nrecopied the famous “statement,” written on a hundred and fifty\r\nfolio sheets, besides the corroborative documents, and the summing up\r\n(contained in one page), with the estimates bracketed, the captions in a\r\nrunning hand, and the sub-titles in a round one. Full of enthusiasm, in\r\nspite of his merely mechanical participation in the great idea, the lad\r\nof twenty would rewrite whole pages for a single blot, and made it his\r\nglory to touch up the writing, regarding it as the element of a noble\r\nundertaking. Sebastien had that afternoon committed the great imprudence\r\nof carrying into the general office, for the purpose of copying, a paper\r\nwhich contained the most dangerous facts to make known prematurely,\r\nnamely, a memorandum relating to the officials in the central offices\r\nof all ministries, with facts concerning their fortunes, actual and\r\nprospective, together with the individual enterprises of each outside of\r\nhis government employment.\r\n\r\nAll government clerks in Paris who are not endowed, like Rabourdin, with\r\npatriotic ambition or other marked capacity, usually add the profits\r\nof some industry to the salary of their office, in order to eke out a\r\nliving. A number do as Monsieur Saillard did,--put their money into a\r\nbusiness carried on by others, and spend their evenings in keeping\r\nthe books of their associates. Many clerks are married to milliners,\r\nlicensed tobacco dealers, women who have charge of the public lotteries\r\nor reading-rooms. Some, like the husband of Madame Colleville,\r\nCelestine’s rival, play in the orchestra of a theatre; others like du\r\nBruel, write vaudeville, comic operas, melodramas, or act as prompters\r\nbehind the scenes. We may mention among them Messrs. Planard, Sewrin,\r\netc. Pigault-Lebrun, Piis, Duvicquet, in their day, were in government\r\nemploy. Monsieur Scribe’s head-librarian was a clerk in the Treasury.\r\n\r\nBesides such information as this, Rabourdin’s memorandum contained an\r\ninquiry into the moral and physical capacities and faculties necessary\r\nin those who were to examine the intelligence, aptitude for labor,\r\nand sound health of the applicants for government service,--three\r\nindispensable qualities in men who are to bear the burden of public\r\naffairs and should do their business well and quickly. But this careful\r\nstudy, the result of ten years’ observation and experience, and of a\r\nlong acquaintance with men and things obtained by intercourse with the\r\nvarious functionaries in the different ministries, would assuredly have,\r\nto those who did not see its purport and connection, an air of treachery\r\nand police espial. If a single page of these papers were to fall under\r\nthe eye of those concerned, Monsieur Rabourdin was lost. Sebastien,\r\nwho admired his chief without reservation, and who was, as yet, wholly\r\nignorant of the evils of bureaucracy, had the follies of guilelessness\r\nas well as its grace. Blamed on a former occasion for carrying away\r\nthese papers, he now bravely acknowledged his fault to its fullest\r\nextent; he related how he had put away both the memorandum and the copy\r\ncarefully in a box in the office where no one would ever find them.\r\nTears rolled from his eyes as he realized the greatness of his offence.\r\n\r\n“Come, come!” said Rabourdin, kindly. “Don’t be so imprudent again, but\r\nnever mind now. Go to the office very early tomorrow morning; here is\r\nthe key of a small safe which is in my roller secretary; it shuts with\r\na combination lock. You can open it with the word ‘sky’; put the\r\nmemorandum and your copy into it and shut it carefully.”\r\n\r\nThis proof of confidence dried the poor fellow’s tears. Rabourdin\r\nadvised him to take a cup of tea and some cakes.\r\n\r\n“Mamma forbids me to drink tea, on account of my chest,” said Sebastien.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my dear child,” said the imposing Madame Rabourdin, who\r\nwished to appear gracious, “here are some sandwiches and cream; come and\r\nsit by me.”\r\n\r\nShe made Sebastien sit down beside her, and the lad’s heart rose in\r\nhis throat as he felt the robe of this divinity brush the sleeve of\r\nhis coat. Just then the beautiful woman caught sight of Monsieur des\r\nLupeaulx standing in the doorway. She smiled, and not waiting till he\r\ncame to her, she went to him.\r\n\r\n“Why do you stay there as if you were sulking?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“I am not sulking,” he returned; “I came to announce some good news,\r\nbut the thought has overtaken me that it will only add to your severity\r\ntowards me. I fancy myself six months hence almost a stranger to you.\r\nYes, you are too clever, and I too experienced,--too blase, if you\r\nlike,--for either of us to deceive the other. Your end is attained\r\nwithout its costing you more than a few smiles and gracious words.”\r\n\r\n“Deceive each other! what can you mean?” she cried, in a hurt tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes; Monsieur de la Billardiere is dying, and from what the minister\r\ntold me this evening I judge that your husband will be appointed in his\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nHe thereupon related what he called his scene at the ministry and the\r\njealousy of the countess, repeating her remarks about the invitation he\r\nhad asked her to send to Madame Rabourdin.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur des Lupeaulx,” said Madame Rabourdin, with dignity, “permit me\r\nto tell you that my husband is the oldest head-clerk as well as the most\r\ncapable man in the division; also that the appointment of La Billardiere\r\nover his head made much talk in the service, and that my husband has\r\nstayed on for the last year expecting this promotion, for which he has\r\nreally no competitor and no rival.”\r\n\r\n“That is true.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” she resumed, smiling and showing her handsome teeth,\r\n“how can you suppose that the friendship I feel for you is marred by a\r\nthought of self-interest? Why should you think me capable of that?”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx made a gesture of admiring denial.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she continued, “the heart of woman will always remain a secret\r\nfor even the cleverest of men. Yes, I welcomed you to my house with the\r\ngreatest pleasure; and there was, I admit, a motive of self-interest\r\nbehind my pleasure--”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“You have a career before you,” she whispered in his ear, “a future\r\nwithout limit; you will be deputy, minister!” (What happiness for an\r\nambitious man when such things as these are warbled in his ear by the\r\nsweet voice of a pretty woman!) “Oh, yes! I know you better than you\r\nknow yourself. Rabourdin is a man who could be of immense service to\r\nyou in such a career; he could do the steady work while you were in\r\nthe Chamber. Just as you dream of the ministry, so I dream of seeing\r\nRabourdin in the Council of State, and general director. It is therefore\r\nmy object to draw together two men who can never injure, but, on the\r\ncontrary, must greatly help each other. Isn’t that a woman’s mission?\r\nIf you are friends, you will both rise the faster, and it is surely\r\nhigh time that each of you made hay. I have burned my ships,” she added,\r\nsmiling. “But you are not as frank with me as I have been with you.”\r\n\r\n“You would not listen to me if I were,” he replied, with a melancholy\r\nair, in spite of the deep inward satisfaction her remarks gave him.\r\n“What would such future promotions avail me, if you dismiss me now?”\r\n\r\n“Before I listen to you,” she replied, with naive Parisian liveliness,\r\n“we must be able to understand each other.”\r\n\r\nAnd she left the old fop to go and speak with Madame de Chessel, a\r\ncountess from the provinces, who seemed about to take leave.\r\n\r\n“That is a very extraordinary woman,” said des Lupeaulx to himself. “I\r\ndon’t know my own self when I am with her.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this man of no principle, who six years earlier had kept\r\na ballet-girl, and who now, thanks to his position, made himself a\r\nseraglio with the pretty wives of the under-clerks, and lived in the\r\nworld of journalists and actresses, became devotedly attentive all the\r\nevening to Celestine, and was the last to leave the house.\r\n\r\n“At last!” thought Madame Rabourdin, as she undressed that night, “we\r\nhave the place! Twelve thousand francs a year and perquisites, beside\r\nthe rents of our farms at Grajeux,--nearly twenty thousand francs a\r\nyear. It is not affluence, but at least it isn’t poverty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THREE-QUARTER LENGTH PORTRAITS OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENT\r\nOFFICIALS\r\n\r\nIf it were possible for literature to use the microscope of the\r\nLeuwenhoeks, the Malpighis, and the Raspails (an attempt once made\r\nby Hoffman, of Berlin), and if we could magnify and then picture the\r\nteredos navalis, in other words, those ship-worms which brought Holland\r\nwithin an inch of collapsing by honey-combing her dykes, we might have\r\nbeen able to give a more distinct idea of Messieurs Gigonnet, Baudoyer,\r\nSaillard, Gaudron, Falleix, Transon, Godard and company, borers and\r\nburrowers, who proved their undermining power in the thirtieth year of\r\nthis century.\r\n\r\nBut now it is time to show another set of teredos, who burrowed and\r\nswarmed in the government offices where the principal scenes of our\r\npresent study took place.\r\n\r\nIn Paris nearly all these government bureaus resemble each other. Into\r\nwhatever ministry you penetrate to ask some slight favor, or to get\r\nredress for a trifling wrong, you will find the same dark corridors,\r\nill-lighted stairways, doors with oval panes of glass like eyes, as at\r\nthe theatre. In the first room as you enter you will find the office\r\nservant; in the second, the under-clerks; the private office of the\r\nsecond head-clerk is to the right or left, and further on is that of\r\nthe head of the bureau. As to the important personage called, under the\r\nEmpire, head of division, then, under the Restoration, director, and now\r\nby the former name, head or chief of division, he lives either above or\r\nbelow the offices of his three or four different bureaus.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in the administrative sense, a bureau consists of a\r\nman-servant, several supernumeraries (who do the work gratis for a\r\ncertain number of years), various copying clerks, writers of bills and\r\ndeeds, order clerks, principal clerks, second or under head-clerk,\r\nand head-clerk, otherwise called head or chief of the bureau. These\r\ndenominational titles vary under some administrations; for instance, the\r\norder-clerks are sometimes called auditors, or again, book-keepers.\r\n\r\nPaved like the corridor, and hung with a shabby paper, the first room,\r\nwhere the servant is stationed, is furnished with a stove, a large black\r\ntable with inkstand, pens, and paper, and benches, but no mats on which\r\nto wipe the public feet. The clerk’s office beyond is a large room,\r\ntolerably well lighted, but seldom floored with wood. Wooden floors and\r\nfireplaces are commonly kept sacred to heads of bureaus and divisions;\r\nand so are closets, wardrobes, mahogany tables, sofas and armchairs\r\ncovered with red or green morocco, silk curtains, and other articles of\r\nadministrative luxury. The clerk’s office contents itself with a stove,\r\nthe pipe of which goes into the chimney, if there be a chimney. The wall\r\npaper is plain and all of one color, usually green or brown. The tables\r\nare of black wood. The private characteristics of the several clerks\r\noften crop out in their method of settling themselves at their\r\ndesks,--the chilly one has a wooden footstool under his feet; the man\r\nwith a bilious temperament has a metal mat; the lymphatic being who\r\ndreads draughts constructs a fortification of boxes on a screen. The\r\ndoor of the under-head-clerk’s office always stands open so that he may\r\nkeep an eye to some extent on his subordinates.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an exact description of Monsieur de la Billardiere’s division\r\nwill suffice to give foreigners and provincials an idea of the internal\r\nmanners and customs of a government office; the chief features of\r\nwhich are probably much the same in the civil service of all European\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, picture to yourself the man who is thus described in\r\nthe Yearly Register:--\r\n\r\n  “Chief of Division.--Monsieur la baron Flamet de la Billardiere\r\n  (Athanase-Jean-Francois-Michel) formerly provost-marshal of\r\n  the department of the Correze, gentleman in ordinary of the\r\n  bed-chamber, president of the college of the department of the\r\n  Dordogne, officer of the Legion of honor, knight of Saint Louis\r\n  and of the foreign orders of Christ, Isabella, Saint Wladimir,\r\n  etc., member of the Academy of Gers, and other learned bodies,\r\n  vice-president of the Society of Belles-lettres, member of the\r\n  Association of Saint-Joseph and of the Society of Prisons, one of\r\n  the mayors of Paris, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe person who requires so much typographic space was at this time\r\noccupying an area five feet six in length by thirty-six inches in\r\nwidth in a bed, his head adorned with a cotton night-cap tied on by\r\nflame-colored ribbons; attended by Despleins, the King’s surgeon, and\r\nyoung doctor Bianchon, flanked by two old female relatives, surrounded\r\nby phials of all kinds, bandages, appliances, and various mortuary\r\ninstruments, and watched over by the curate of Saint-Roch, who was\r\nadvising him to think of his salvation.\r\n\r\nLa Billardiere’s division occupied the upper floor of a magnificent\r\nmansion, in which the vast official ocean of a ministry was contained.\r\nA wide landing separated its two bureaus, the doors of which were duly\r\nlabelled. The private offices and antechambers of the heads of the two\r\nbureaus, Monsieur Rabourdin and Monsieur Baudoyer, were below on\r\nthe second floor, and beyond that of Monsieur Rabourdin were the\r\nantechamber, salon, and two offices of Monsieur de la Billardiere.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor, divided in two by an entresol, were the living\r\nrooms and office of Monsieur Ernest de la Briere, an occult and powerful\r\npersonage who must be described in a few words, for he well deserves\r\nthe parenthesis. This young man held, during the whole time that this\r\nparticular administration lasted, the position of private secretary\r\nto the minister. His apartment was connected by a secret door with the\r\nprivate office of his Excellency. A private secretary is to the minister\r\nhimself what des Lupeaulx was to the ministry at large. The same\r\ndifference existed between young La Briere and des Lupeaulx that there\r\nis between an aide-de-camp and a chief of staff. This ministerial\r\napprentice decamps when his protector leaves office, returning sometimes\r\nwhen he returns. If the minister enjoys the royal favor when he falls,\r\nor still has parliamentary hopes, he takes his secretary with him into\r\nretirement only to bring him back on his return; otherwise he puts him\r\nto grass in some of the various administrative pastures,--for instance,\r\nin the Court of Exchequer, that wayside refuge where private secretaries\r\nwait for the storm to blow over. The young man is not precisely a\r\ngovernment official; he is a political character, however; and sometimes\r\nhis politics are limited to those of one man. When we think of the\r\nnumber of letters it is the private secretary’s fate to open and read,\r\nbesides all his other avocations, it is very evident that under a\r\nmonarchical government his services would be well paid for. A drudge\r\nof this kind costs ten or twenty thousand francs a year; and he enjoys,\r\nmoreover, the opera-boxes, the social invitations, and the carriages of\r\nthe minister. The Emperor of Russia would be thankful to be able to pay\r\nfifty thousand a year to one of these amiable constitutional poodles,\r\nso gentle, so nicely curled, so caressing, so docile, always spick and\r\nspan,--careful watch-dogs besides, and faithful to a degree! But\r\nthe private secretary is a product of the representative government\r\nhot-house; he is propagated and developed there, and there only. Under\r\na monarchy you will find none but courtiers and vassals, whereas under a\r\nconstitutional government you may be flattered, served, and adulated by\r\nfree men. In France ministers are better off than kings or women; they\r\nhave some one who thoroughly understands them. Perhaps, indeed, the\r\nprivate secretary is to be pitied as much as women and white paper. They\r\nare nonentities who are made to bear all things. They are allowed no\r\ntalents except hidden ones, which must be employed in the service of\r\ntheir ministers. A public show of talent would ruin them. The\r\nprivate secretary is therefore an intimate friend in the gift of\r\ngovernment--However, let us return to the bureaus.\r\n\r\nThree men-servants lived in peace in the Billardiere division, to wit: a\r\nfootman for the two bureaus, another for the service of the two chiefs,\r\nand a third for the director of the division himself. All three were\r\nlodged, warmed, and clothed by the State, and wore the well-known livery\r\nof the State, blue coat with red pipings for undress, and broad red,\r\nwhite, and blue braid for great occasions. La Billardiere’s man had the\r\nair of a gentleman-usher, an innovation which gave an aspect of dignity\r\nto the division.\r\n\r\nPillars of the ministry, experts in all manners and customs\r\nbureaucratic, well-warmed and clothed at the State’s expense, growing\r\nrich by reason of their few wants, these lackeys saw completely through\r\nthe government officials, collectively and individually. They had\r\nno better way of amusing their idle hours than by observing these\r\npersonages and studying their peculiarities. They knew how far to trust\r\nthe clerks with loans of money, doing their various commissions with\r\nabsolute discretion; they pawned and took out of pawn, bought up bills\r\nwhen due, and lent money without interest, albeit no clerk ever borrowed\r\nof them without returning a “gratification.” These servants without a\r\nmaster received a salary of nine hundred francs a year; new years’ gifts\r\nand “gratifications” brought their emoluments to twelve hundred francs,\r\nand they made almost as much money by serving breakfasts to the clerks\r\nat the office.\r\n\r\nThe elder of these men, who was also the richest, waited upon the main\r\nbody of the clerks. He was sixty years of age, with white hair cropped\r\nshort like a brush; stout, thickset, and apoplectic about the neck, with\r\na vulgar pimpled face, gray eyes, and a mouth like a furnace door;\r\nsuch was the profile portrait of Antoine, the oldest attendant in the\r\nministry. He had brought his two nephews, Laurent and Gabriel, from\r\nEchelles in Savoie,--one to serve the heads of the bureaus, the other\r\nthe director himself. All three came to open the offices and clean them,\r\nbetween seven and eight o’clock in the morning; at which time they read\r\nthe newspapers and talked civil service politics from their point of\r\nview with the servants of other divisions, exchanging the bureaucratic\r\ngossip. In common with servants of modern houses who know their masters’\r\nprivate affairs thoroughly, they lived at the ministry like spiders at\r\nthe centre of a web, where they felt the slightest jar of the fabric.\r\n\r\nOn a Thursday evening, the day after the ministerial reception and\r\nMadame Rabourdin’s evening party, just as Antoine was trimming his beard\r\nand his nephews were assisting him in the antechamber of the division on\r\nthe upper floor, they were surprised by the unexpected arrival of one of\r\nthe clerks.\r\n\r\n“That’s Monsieur Dutocq,” said Antoine. “I know him by that pickpocket\r\nstep of his. He is always moving round on the sly, that man. He is on\r\nyour back before you know it. Yesterday, contrary to his usual ways, he\r\noutstayed the last man in the office; such a thing hasn’t happened three\r\ntimes since he has been at the ministry.”\r\n\r\nHere follows the portrait of Monsieur Dutocq, order-clerk in the\r\nRabourdin bureau: Thirty-eight years old, oblong face and bilious skin,\r\ngrizzled hair always cut close, low forehead, heavy eyebrows meeting\r\ntogether, a crooked nose and pinched lips; tall, the right shoulder\r\nslightly higher than the left; brown coat, black waistcoat, silk cravat,\r\nyellowish trousers, black woollen stockings, and shoes with\r\nflapping bows; thus you behold him. Idle and incapable, he hated\r\nRabourdin,--naturally enough, for Rabourdin had no vice to flatter, and\r\nno bad or weak side on which Dutocq could make himself useful. Far too\r\nnoble to injure a clerk, the chief was also too clear-sighted to be\r\ndeceived by any make-believe. Dutocq kept his place therefore solely\r\nthrough Rabourdin’s generosity, and was very certain that he could\r\nnever be promoted if the latter succeeded La Billardiere. Though he knew\r\nhimself incapable of important work, Dutocq was well aware that in\r\na government office incapacity was no hindrance to advancement; La\r\nBillardiere’s own appointment over the head of so capable a man as\r\nRabourdin had been a striking and fatal example of this. Wickedness\r\ncombined with self-interest works with a power equivalent to that\r\nof intellect; evilly disposed and wholly self-interested, Dutocq had\r\nendeavoured to strengthen his position by becoming a spy in all the\r\noffices. After 1816 he assumed a marked religious tone, foreseeing\r\nthe favor which the fools of those days would bestow on those they\r\nindiscriminately called Jesuits. Belonging to that fraternity in spirit,\r\nthough not admitted to its rites, Dutocq went from bureau to bureau,\r\nsounded consciences by recounting immoral jests, and then reported and\r\nparaphrased results to des Lupeaulx; the latter thus learned all the\r\ntrivial events of the ministry, and often surprised the minister by his\r\nconsummate knowledge of what was going on. He tolerated Dutocq under the\r\nidea that circumstances might some day make him useful, were it only\r\nto get him or some distinguished friend of his out of a scrape by a\r\ndisgraceful marriage. The two understood each other well. Dutocq had\r\nsucceeded Monsieur Poiret the elder, who had retired in 1814, and now\r\nlived in the pension Vanquer in the Latin quarter. Dutocq himself\r\nlived in a pension in the rue de Beaune, and spent his evenings in the\r\nPalais-Royal, sometimes going to the theatre, thanks to du Bruel, who\r\ngave him an author’s ticket about once a week. And now, a word on du\r\nBruel.\r\n\r\nThough Sebastien did his work at the office for the small compensation\r\nwe have mentioned, du Bruel was in the habit of coming there to\r\nadvertise the fact that he was the under-head-clerk and to draw\r\nhis salary. His real work was that of dramatic critic to a leading\r\nministerial journal, in which he also wrote articles inspired by\r\nthe ministers,--a very well understood, clearly defined, and quite\r\nunassailable position. Du Bruel was not lacking in those diplomatic\r\nlittle tricks which go so far to conciliate general good-will. He sent\r\nMadame Rabourdin an opera-box for a first representation, took her\r\nthere in a carriage and brought her back,--an attention which evidently\r\npleased her. Rabourdin, who was never exacting with his subordinates\r\nallowed du Bruel to go off to rehearsals, come to the office at his\r\nown hours, and work at his vaudevilles when there. Monsieur le Duc de\r\nChaulieu, the minister, knew that du Bruel was writing a novel which was\r\nto be dedicated to himself. Dressed with the careless ease of a theatre\r\nman, du Bruel wore, in the morning, trousers strapped under his feet,\r\nshoes with gaiters, a waistcoat evidently vamped over, an olive surtout,\r\nand a black cravat. At night he played the gentleman in elegant clothes.\r\nHe lived, for good reasons, in the same house as Florine, an actress for\r\nwhom he wrote plays. Du Bruel, or to give him his pen name, Cursy, was\r\nworking just now at a piece in five acts for the Francais. Sebastien\r\nwas devoted to the author,--who occasionally gave him tickets to the\r\npit,--and applauded his pieces at the parts which du Bruel told him were\r\nof doubtful interest, with all the faith and enthusiasm of his years. In\r\nfact, the youth looked upon the playwright as a great author, and it was\r\nto Sebastien that du Bruel said, the day after a first representation\r\nof a vaudeville produced, like all vaudevilles, by three collaborators,\r\n“The audience preferred the scenes written by two.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you write alone?” asked Sebastien naively.\r\n\r\nThere were good reasons why du Bruel did not write alone. He was the\r\nthird of an author. A dramatic writer, as few people know, is made up\r\nof three individuals; first, the man with brains who invents the subject\r\nand maps out the structure, or scenario, of the vaudeville; second, the\r\nplodder, who works the piece into shape; and third, the toucher-up, who\r\nsets the songs to music, arranges the chorus and concerted pieces and\r\nfits them into their right place, and finally writes the puffs and\r\nadvertisements. Du Bruel was a plodder; at the office he read the newest\r\nbooks, extracted their wit, and laid it by for use in his dialogues. He\r\nwas liked by his collaborators on account of his carefulness; the man\r\nwith brains, sure of being understood, could cross his arms and feel\r\nthat his ideas would be well rendered. The clerks in the office liked\r\ntheir companion well enough to attend a first performance of his plays\r\nin a body and applaud them, for he really deserved the title of a\r\ngood fellow. His hand went readily to his pocket; ices and punch were\r\nbestowed without prodding, and he loaned fifty francs without asking\r\nthem back. He owned a country-house at Aulnay, laid by his money, and\r\nhad, besides the four thousand five hundred francs of his salary under\r\ngovernment, twelve hundred francs pension from the civil list, and\r\neight hundred from the three hundred thousand francs fund voted by the\r\nChambers for encouragement of the Arts. Add to these diverse emoluments\r\nnine thousand francs earned by his quarters, thirds, and halves of plays\r\nin three different theatres, and you will readily understand that such\r\na man must be physically round, fat, and comfortable, with the face of\r\na worthy capitalist. As to morals, he was the lover and the beloved\r\nof Tullia and felt himself preferred in heart to the brilliant Duc de\r\nRhetore, the lover in chief.\r\n\r\nDutocq had seen with great uneasiness what he called the liaison of des\r\nLupeaulx with Madame Rabourdin, and his silent wrath on the subject\r\nwas accumulating. He had too prying an eye not to have guessed that\r\nRabourdin was engaged in some great work outside of his official labors,\r\nand he was provoked to feel that he knew nothing about it, whereas\r\nthat little Sebastien was, wholly or in part, in the secret. Dutocq was\r\nintimate with Godard, under-head-clerk to Baudoyer, and the high esteem\r\nin which Dutocq held Baudoyer was the original cause of his acquaintance\r\nwith Godard; not that Dutocq was sincere even in this; but by praising\r\nBaudoyer and saying nothing of Rabourdin he satisfied his hatred after\r\nthe fashion of little minds.\r\n\r\nJoseph Godard, a cousin of Mitral on the mother’s side, made pretension\r\nto the hand of Mademoiselle Baudoyer, not perceiving that her mother was\r\nlaying siege to Falliex as a son-in-law. He brought little gifts to the\r\nyoung lady, artificial flowers, bonbons on New-Year’s day and pretty\r\nboxes for her birthday. Twenty-six years of age, a worker working\r\nwithout purpose, steady as a girl, monotonous and apathetic, holding\r\ncafes, cigars, and horsemanship in detestation, going to bed regularly\r\nat ten o’clock and rising at seven, gifted with some social talents,\r\nsuch as playing quadrille music on the flute, which first brought him\r\ninto favor with the Saillards and the Baudoyers. He was moreover a fifer\r\nin the National Guard,--to escape his turn of sitting up all night in a\r\nbarrack-room. Godard was devoted more especially to natural history. He\r\nmade collections of shells and minerals, knew how to stuff birds, kept\r\na mass of curiosities bought for nothing in his bedroom; took\r\npossession of phials and empty perfume bottles for his specimens; pinned\r\nbutterflies and beetles under glass, hung Chinese parasols on the\r\nwalls, together with dried fishskins. He lived with his sister, an\r\nartificial-flower maker, in the due de Richelieu. Though much admired\r\nby mammas this model young man was looked down upon by his sister’s\r\nshop-girls, who had tried to inveigle him. Slim and lean, of medium\r\nheight, with dark circles round his eyes, Joseph Godard took little care\r\nof his person; his clothes were ill-cut, his trousers bagged, he wore\r\nwhite stockings at all seasons of the year, a hat with a narrow brim and\r\nlaced shoes. He was always complaining of his digestion. His principal\r\nvice was a mania for proposing rural parties during the summer\r\nseason, excursions to Montmorency, picnics on the grass, and visits to\r\ncreameries on the boulevard du Mont-Parnasse. For the last six months\r\nDutocq had taken to visiting Mademoiselle Godard from time to time, with\r\ncertain views of his own, hoping to discover in her establishment some\r\nfemale treasure.\r\n\r\nThus Baudoyer had a pair of henchmen in Dutocq and Godard. Monsieur\r\nSaillard, too innocent to judge rightly of Dutocq, was in the habit of\r\npaying him frequent little visits at the office. Young La Billardiere,\r\nthe director’s son, placed as supernumerary with Baudoyer, made another\r\nmember of the clique. The clever heads in the offices laughed much at\r\nthis alliance of incapables. Bixiou named Baudoyer, Godard, and Dutocq\r\na “Trinity without the Spirit,” and little La Billardiere the “Pascal\r\nLamb.”\r\n\r\n“You are early this morning,” said Antoine to Dutocq, laughing.\r\n\r\n“So are you, Antoine,” answered Dutocq; “you see, the newspapers do come\r\nearlier than you let us have them at the office.”\r\n\r\n“They did to-day, by chance,” replied Antoine, not disconcerted; “they\r\nnever come two days together at the same hour.”\r\n\r\nThe two nephews looked at each other as if to say, in admiration of\r\ntheir uncle, “What cheek he has!”\r\n\r\n“Though I make two sous by all his breakfasts,” muttered Antoine, as he\r\nheard Monsieur Dutocq close the office door, “I’d give them up to get\r\nthat man out of our division.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Monsieur Sebastien, you are not the first here to-day,” said\r\nAntoine, a quarter of an hour later, to the supernumerary.\r\n\r\n“Who is here?” asked the poor lad, turning pale.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Dutocq,” answered Laurent.\r\n\r\nVirgin natures have, beyond all others, the inexplicable gift of\r\nsecond-sight, the reason of which lies perhaps in the purity of their\r\nnervous systems, which are, as it were, brand-new. Sebastien had long\r\nguessed Dutocq’s hatred to his revered Rabourdin. So that when Laurent\r\nuttered his name a dreadful presentiment took possession of the lad’s\r\nmind, and crying out, “I feared it!” he flew like an arrow into the\r\ncorridor.\r\n\r\n“There is going to be a row in the division,” said Antoine, shaking his\r\nwhite head as he put on his livery. “It is very certain that Monsieur le\r\nbaron is off to his account. Yes, Madame Gruget, the nurse, told me he\r\ncouldn’t live through the day. What a stir there’ll be! oh! won’t there!\r\nGo along, you fellows, and see if the stoves are drawing properly.\r\nHeavens and earth! our world is coming down about our ears.”\r\n\r\n“That poor young one,” said Laurent, “had a sort of sunstroke when he\r\nheard that Jesuit of a Dutocq had got here before him.”\r\n\r\n“I have told him a dozen times,--for after all one ought to tell the\r\ntruth to an honest clerk, and what I call an honest clerk is one like\r\nthat little fellow who gives us ‘recta’ his ten francs on New-Year’s\r\nday,--I have said to him again and again: The more you work the more\r\nthey’ll make you work, and they won’t promote you. He doesn’t listen to\r\nme; he tires himself out staying here till five o’clock, an hour after\r\nall the others have gone. Folly! he’ll never get on that way! The proof\r\nis that not a word has been said about giving him an appointment, though\r\nhe has been here two years. It’s a shame! it makes my blood boil.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Rabourdin is very fond of Monsieur Sebastien,” said Laurent.\r\n\r\n“But Monsieur Rabourdin isn’t a minister,” retorted Antoine; “it will\r\nbe a hot day when that happens, and the hens will have teeth; he is\r\ntoo--but mum! When I think that I carry salaries to those humbugs who\r\nstay away and do as they please, while that poor little La Roche works\r\nhimself to death, I ask myself if God ever thinks of the civil service.\r\nAnd what do they give you, these pets of Monsieur le marechal and\r\nMonsieur le duc? ‘Thank you, my dear Antoine, thank you,’ with a\r\ngracious nod! Pack of sluggards! go to work, or you’ll bring another\r\nrevolution about your ears. Didn’t see such goings-on under Monsieur\r\nRobert Lindet. I know, for I served my apprenticeship under Robert\r\nLindet. The clerks had to work in his day! You ought to have seen how\r\nthey scratched paper here till midnight; why, the stoves went out\r\nand nobody noticed it. It was all because the guillotine was there!\r\nnow-a-days they only mark ‘em when they come in late!”\r\n\r\n“Uncle Antoine,” said Gabriel, “as you are so talkative this morning,\r\njust tell us what you think a clerk really ought to be.”\r\n\r\n“A government clerk,” replied Antoine, gravely, “is a man who sits in a\r\ngovernment office and writes. But there, there, what am I talking about?\r\nWithout the clerks, where should we be, I’d like to know? Go along\r\nand look after your stoves and mind you never say harm of a government\r\nclerk, you fellows. Gabriel, the stove in the large office draws like\r\nthe devil; you must turn the damper.”\r\n\r\nAntoine stationed himself at a corner of the landing whence he could see\r\nall the officials as they entered the porte-cochere; he knew every one\r\nat the ministry, and watched their behavior, observing narrowly the\r\ncontrasts in their dress and appearance.\r\n\r\nThe first to arrive after Sebastien was a clerk of deeds in Rabourdin’s\r\noffice named Phellion, a respectable family-man. To the influence of his\r\nchief he owed a half-scholarship for each of his two sons in the College\r\nHenri IV.; while his daughter was being educated gratis at a boarding\r\nschool where his wife gave music lessons and he himself a course of\r\nhistory and one of geography in the evenings. He was about forty-five\r\nyears of age, sergeant-major of his company in the National Guard, very\r\ncompassionate in feeling and words, but wholly unable to give away\r\na penny. Proud of his post, however, and satisfied with his lot, he\r\napplied himself faithfully to serve the government, believed he was\r\nuseful to his country, and boasted of his indifference to politics,\r\nknowing none but those of the men in power. Monsieur Rabourdin pleased\r\nhim highly whenever he asked him to stay half an hour longer to finish\r\na piece of work. On such occasions he would say, when he reached home,\r\n“Public affairs detained me; when a man belongs to the government he is\r\nno longer master of himself.” He compiled books of questions and answers\r\non various studies for the use of young ladies in boarding-schools.\r\nThese little “solid treatises,” as he called them, were sold at\r\nthe University library under the name of “Historical and Geographic\r\nCatechisms.” Feeling himself in duty bound to offer a copy of each\r\nvolume, bound in red morocco, to Monsieur Rabourdin, he always came in\r\nfull dress to present them,--breeches and silk stockings, and shoes\r\nwith gold buckles. Monsieur Phellion received his friends on Thursday\r\nevenings, on which occasions the company played bouillote, at five sous\r\na game, and were regaled with cakes and beer. He had never yet dared\r\nto invite Monsieur Rabourdin to honor him with his presence, though he\r\nwould have regarded such an event as the most distinguished of his life.\r\nHe said if he could leave one of his sons following in the steps of\r\nMonsieur Rabourdin he should die the happiest father in the world.\r\n\r\nOne of his greatest pleasures was to explore the environs of Paris,\r\nwhich he did with a map. He knew every inch of Arcueil, Bievre,\r\nFontenay-aux-Roses, and Aulnay, so famous as the resort of great\r\nwriters, and hoped in time to know the whole western side of the country\r\naround Paris. He intended to put his eldest son into a government office\r\nand his second into the Ecole Polytechnique. He often said to the elder,\r\n“When you have the honor to be a government clerk”; though he suspected\r\nhim of a preference for the exact sciences and did his best to repress\r\nit, mentally resolved to abandon the lad to his own devices if he\r\npersisted. When Rabourdin sent for him to come down and receive\r\ninstructions about some particular piece of work, Phellion gave all his\r\nmind to it,--listening to every word the chief said, as a dilettante\r\nlistens to an air at the Opera. Silent in the office, with his feet in\r\nthe air resting on a wooden desk, and never moving them, he studied his\r\ntask conscientiously. His official letters were written with the utmost\r\ngravity, and transmitted the commands of the minister in solemn phrases.\r\nMonsieur Phellion’s face was that of a pensive ram, with little color\r\nand pitted by the small-pox; the lips were thick and the lower one\r\npendent; the eyes light-blue, and his figure above the common height.\r\nNeat and clean as a master of history and geography in a young ladies’\r\nschool ought to be, he wore fine linen, a pleated shirt-frill, a black\r\ncashmere waistcoat, left open and showing a pair of braces embroidered\r\nby his daughter, a diamond in the bosom of his shirt, a black coat,\r\nand blue trousers. In winter he added a nut-colored box-coat with\r\nthree capes, and carried a loaded stick, necessitated, he said, by the\r\nprofound solitude of the quarter in which he lived. He had given up\r\ntaking snuff, and referred to this reform as a striking example of the\r\nempire a man could exercise over himself. Monsieur Phellion came slowly\r\nup the stairs, for he was afraid of asthma, having what he called an\r\n“adipose chest.” He saluted Antoine with dignity.\r\n\r\nThe next to follow was a copying-clerk, who presented a strange contrast\r\nto the virtuous Phellion. Vimeux was a young man of twenty-five, with\r\na salary of fifteen hundred francs, well-made and graceful, with a\r\nromantic face, and eyes, hair, beard, and eyebrows as black as jet, fine\r\nteeth, charming hands, and wearing a moustache so carefully trimmed\r\nthat he seemed to have made it the business and occupation of his life.\r\nVimeux had such aptitude for work that he despatched it much quicker\r\nthan any of the other clerks. “He has a gift, that young man!” Phellion\r\nsaid of him when he saw him cross his legs and have nothing to do for\r\nthe rest of the day, having got through his appointed task; “and see\r\nwhat a little dandy he is!” Vimeux breakfasted on a roll and a glass\r\nof water, dined for twenty sous at Katcomb’s, and lodged in a furnished\r\nroom, for which he paid twelve francs a month. His happiness, his sole\r\npleasure in life, was dress. He ruined himself in miraculous waistcoats,\r\nin trousers that were tight, half-tight, pleated, or embroidered; in\r\nsuperfine boots, well-made coats which outlined his elegant figure; in\r\nbewitching collars, spotless gloves, and immaculate hats. A ring with a\r\ncoat of arms adorned his hand, outside his glove, from which dangled a\r\nhandsome cane; with these accessories he endeavoured to assume the air\r\nand manner of a wealthy young man. After the office closed he appeared\r\nin the great walk of the Tuileries, with a tooth-pick in his mouth, as\r\nthough he were a millionaire who had just dined. Always on the\r\nlookout for a woman,--an Englishwoman, a foreigner of some kind, or\r\na widow,--who might fall in love with him, he practised the art of\r\ntwirling his cane and of flinging the sort of glance which Bixiou told\r\nhim was American. He smiled to show his fine teeth; he wore no socks\r\nunder his boots, but he had his hair curled every day. Vimeux was\r\nprepared, in accordance with fixed principles, to marry a hunch-back\r\nwith six thousand a year, or a woman of forty-five at eight thousand, or\r\nan Englishwoman for half that sum. Phellion, who delighted in his\r\nneat hand-writing, and was full of compassion for the fellow, read him\r\nlectures on the duty of giving lessons in penmanship,--an honorable\r\ncareer, he said, which would ameliorate existence and even render\r\nit agreeable; he promised him a situation in a young ladies’\r\nboarding-school. But Vimeux’s head was so full of his own idea that\r\nno human being could prevent him from having faith in his star. He\r\ncontinued to lay himself out, like a salmon at a fishmonger’s, in spite\r\nof his empty stomach and the fact that he had fruitlessly exhibited his\r\nenormous moustache and his fine clothes for over three years. As he owed\r\nAntoine more than thirty francs for his breakfasts, he lowered his eyes\r\nevery time he passed him; and yet he never failed at midday to ask the\r\nman to buy him a roll.\r\n\r\nAfter trying to get a few reasonable ideas into this foolish head,\r\nRabourdin had finally given up the attempt as hopeless. Adolphe (his\r\nfamily name was Adolphe) had lately economized on dinners and lived\r\nentirely on bread and water, to buy a pair of spurs and a riding-whip.\r\nJokes at the expense of this starving Amadis were made only in the\r\nspirit of mischievous fun which creates vaudevilles, for he was really a\r\nkind-hearted fellow and a good comrade, who harmed no one but himself.\r\nA standing joke in the two bureaus was the question whether he wore\r\ncorsets, and bets depended on it. Vimeux was originally appointed to\r\nBaudoyer’s bureau, but he manoeuvred to get himself transferred to\r\nRabourdin’s, on account of Baudoyer’s extreme severity in relation to\r\nwhat were called “the English,”--a name given by the government clerks\r\nto their creditors. “English day” means the day on which the government\r\noffices are thrown open to the public. Certain then of finding their\r\ndelinquent debtors, the creditors swarm in and torment them, asking\r\nwhen they intend to pay, and threatening to attach their salaries. The\r\nimplacable Baudoyer compelled the clerks to remain at their desks and\r\nendure this torture. “It was their place not to make debts,” he said;\r\nand he considered his severity as a duty which he owed to the public\r\nweal. Rabourdin, on the contrary, protected the clerks against their\r\ncreditors, and turned the latter away, saying that the government\r\nbureaus were open for public business, not private. Much ridicule\r\npursued Vimeux in both bureaus when the clank of his spurs resounded in\r\nthe corridors and on the staircases. The wag of the ministry, Bixiou,\r\nsent round a paper, headed by a caricature of his victim on a pasteboard\r\nhorse, asking for subscriptions to buy him a live charger. Monsieur\r\nBaudoyer was down for a bale of hay taken from his own forage allowance,\r\nand each of the clerks wrote his little epigram; Vimeux himself,\r\ngood-natured fellow that he was, subscribed under the name of “Miss\r\nFairfax.”\r\n\r\nHandsome clerks of the Vimeux style have their salaries on which to\r\nlive, and their good looks by which to make their fortune. Devoted to\r\nmasked balls during the carnival, they seek their luck there, though it\r\noften escapes them. Many end the weary round by marrying milliners, or\r\nold women,--sometimes, however, young ones who are charmed with their\r\nhandsome persons, and with whom they set up a romance illustrated with\r\nstupid love letters, which, nevertheless, seem to answer their purpose.\r\n\r\nBixiou (pronounce it Bisiou) was a draughtsman, who ridiculed Dutocq\r\nas readily as he did Rabourdin, whom he nicknamed “the virtuous woman.”\r\n Without doubt the cleverest man in the division or even in the ministry\r\n(but clever after the fashion of a monkey, without aim or sequence),\r\nBixiou was so essentially useful to Baudoyer and Godard that they upheld\r\nand protected him in spite of his misconduct; for he did their work when\r\nthey were incapable of doing it for themselves. Bixiou wanted either\r\nGodard’s or du Bruel’s place as under-head-clerk, but his conduct\r\ninterfered with his promotion. Sometimes he sneered at the public\r\nservice; this was usually after he had made some happy hit, such as the\r\npublication of portraits in the famous Fualdes case (for which he drew\r\nfaces hap-hazard), or his sketch of the debate on the Castaing affair.\r\nAt other times, when possessed with a desire to get on, he really\r\napplied himself to work, though he would soon leave off to write a\r\nvaudeville, which was never finished. A thorough egoist, a spendthrift\r\nand a miser in one,--that is to say, spending his money solely on\r\nhimself,--sharp, aggressive, and indiscreet, he did mischief for\r\nmischief’s sake; above all, he attacked the weak, respected nothing and\r\nbelieved in nothing, neither in France, nor in God, nor in art, nor\r\nin the Greeks, nor in the Turks, nor in the monarchy,--insulting and\r\ndisparaging everything that he could not comprehend. He was the first\r\nto paint a black cap on Charles X.’s head on the five-franc coins. He\r\nmimicked Dr. Gall when lecturing, till he made the most starched of\r\ndiplomatists burst their buttons. Famous for his practical jokes, he\r\nvaried them with such elaborate care that he always obtained a victim.\r\nHis great secret in this was the power of guessing the inmost wishes of\r\nothers; he knew the way to many a castle in the air, to the dreams about\r\nwhich a man may be fooled because he wants to be; and he made such men\r\nsit to him for hours.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that this close observer, who could display unrivalled\r\ntact in developing a joke or driving home a sarcasm, was unable to use\r\nthe same power to make men further his fortunes and promote him. The\r\nperson he most liked to annoy was young La Billardiere, his nightmare,\r\nhis detestation, whom he was nevertheless constantly wheedling so as\r\nthe better to torment him on his weakest side. He wrote him love letters\r\nsigned “Comtesse de M----” or “Marquise de B--“; took him to the Opera\r\non gala days and presented him to some grisette under the clock, after\r\ncalling everybody’s attention to the young fool. He allied himself with\r\nDutocq (whom he regarded as a solemn juggler) in his hatred to Rabourdin\r\nand his praise of Baudoyer, and did his best to support him. Jean-Jaques\r\nBixiou was the grandson of a Parisian grocer. His father, who died\r\na colonel, left him to the care of his grandmother, who married her\r\nhead-clerk, named Descoings, after the death of her first husband, and\r\ndied in 1822. Finding himself without prospects on leaving college, he\r\nattempted painting, but in spite of his intimacy with Joseph Bridau,\r\nhis life-long friend, he abandoned art to take up caricature, vignette\r\ndesigning, and drawing for books, which twenty years later went by the\r\nname of “illustration.” The influence of the Ducs de Maufrigneuse and\r\nde Rhetore, whom he knew in the society of actresses, procured him his\r\nemployment under government in 1819. On good terms with des Lupeaulx,\r\nwith whom in society he stood on an equality, and intimate with du\r\nBruel, he was a living proof of Rabourdin’s theory as to the steady\r\ndeterioration of the administrative hierarchy in Paris through the\r\npersonal importance which a government official may acquire outside of\r\na government office. Short in stature but well-formed, with a delicate\r\nface remarkable for its vague likeness to Napoleon’s, thin lips, a\r\nstraight chin, chestnut whiskers, twenty-seven years old, fair-skinned,\r\nwith a piercing voice and sparkling eye,--such was Bixiou; a man, all\r\nsense and all wit, who abandoned himself to a mad pursuit of pleasure of\r\nevery description, which threw him into a constant round of dissipation.\r\nHunter of grisettes, smoker, jester, diner-out and frequenter of\r\nsupper-parties, always tuned to the highest pitch, shining equally in\r\nthe greenroom and at the balls given among the grisettes of the Allee\r\ndes Veuves, he was just as surprisingly entertaining at table as at a\r\npicnic, as gay and lively at midnight on the streets as in the morning\r\nwhen he jumped out of bed, and yet at heart gloomy and melancholy, like\r\nmost of the great comic players.\r\n\r\nLaunched into the world of actors and actresses, writers, artists, and\r\ncertain women of uncertain means, he lived well, went to the theatre\r\nwithout paying, gambled at Frascati, and often won. Artist by nature and\r\nreally profound, though by flashes only, he swayed to and fro in life\r\nlike a swing, without thinking or caring of a time when the cord would\r\nbreak. The liveliness of his wit and the prodigal flow of his ideas\r\nmade him acceptable to all persons who took pleasure in the lights of\r\nintellect; but none of his friends liked him. Incapable of checking a\r\nwitty saying, he would scarify his two neighbors before a dinner was\r\nhalf over. In spite of his skin-deep gayety, a secret dissatisfaction\r\nwith his social position could be detected in his speech; he aspired\r\nto something better, but the fatal demon hiding in his wit hindered\r\nhim from acquiring the gravity which imposes on fools. He lived on the\r\nsecond floor of a house in the rue de Ponthieu, where he had three rooms\r\ndelivered over to the untidiness of a bachelor’s establishment, in fact,\r\na regular bivouac. He often talked of leaving France and seeking his\r\nfortune in America. No wizard could foretell the future of this\r\nyoung man in whom all talents were incomplete; who was incapable of\r\nperseverance, intoxicated with pleasure, and who acted on the belief\r\nthat the world ended on the morrow.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of dress Bixiou had the merit of never being ridiculous;\r\nhe was perhaps the only official of the ministry whose dress did not\r\nlead outsiders to say, “That man is a government clerk!” He wore elegant\r\nboots with black trousers strapped under them, a fancy waistcoat,\r\na becoming blue coat, collars that were the never-ending gift of\r\ngrisettes, one of Bandoni’s hats, and a pair of dark-colored kid gloves.\r\nHis walk and bearing, cavalier and simple both, were not without grace.\r\nHe knew all this, and when des Lupeaulx summoned him for a piece\r\nof impertinence said and done about Monsieur de la Billardiere and\r\nthreatened him with dismissal, Bixiou replied, “You will take me back\r\nbecause my clothes do credit to the ministry”; and des Lupeaulx,\r\nunable to keep from laughing, let the matter pass. The most harmless of\r\nBixiou’s jokes perpetrated among the clerks was the one he played off\r\nupon Godard, presenting him with a butterfly just brought from China,\r\nwhich the worthy man keeps in his collection and exhibits to this day,\r\nblissfully unconscious that it is only painted paper. Bixiou had the\r\npatience to work up the little masterpiece for the sole purpose of\r\nhoaxing his superior.\r\n\r\nThe devil always puts a martyr near a Bixiou. Baudoyer’s bureau held the\r\nmartyr, a poor copying-clerk twenty-two years of age, with a salary of\r\nfifteen hundred francs, named Auguste-Jean-Francois Minard. Minard had\r\nmarried for love the daughter of a porter, an artificial-flower maker\r\nemployed by Mademoiselle Godard. Zelie Lorrain, a pupil, in the first\r\nplace, of the Conservatoire, then by turns a danseuse, a singer, and an\r\nactress, had thought of doing as so many of the working-women do;\r\nbut the fear of consequences kept her from vice. She was floating\r\nundecidedly along, when Minard appeared upon the scene with a definite\r\nproposal of marriage. Zelie earned five hundred francs a year, Minard\r\nhad fifteen hundred. Believing that they could live on two thousand,\r\nthey married without settlements, and started with the utmost economy.\r\nThey went to live, like dove-turtles, near the barriere de Courcelles,\r\nin a little apartment at three hundred francs a year, with white cotton\r\ncurtains to the windows, a Scotch paper costing fifteen sous a roll on\r\nthe walls, brick floors well polished, walnut furniture in the parlor,\r\nand a tiny kitchen that was very clean. Zelie nursed her children\r\nherself when they came, cooked, made her flowers, and kept the\r\nhouse. There was something very touching in this happy and laborious\r\nmediocrity. Feeling that Minard truly loved her, Zelie loved him. Love\r\nbegets love,--it is the abyssus abyssum of the Bible. The poor man\r\nleft his bed in the morning before his wife was up, that he might fetch\r\nprovisions. He carried the flowers she had finished, on his way to the\r\nbureau, and bought her materials on his way back; then, while waiting\r\nfor dinner, he stamped out her leaves, trimmed the twigs, or rubbed\r\nher colors. Small, slim, and wiry, with crisp red hair, eyes of a light\r\nyellow, a skin of dazzling fairness, though blotched with red, the man\r\nhad a sturdy courage that made no show. He knew the science of writing\r\nquite as well as Vimeux. At the office he kept in the background,\r\ndoing his allotted task with the collected air of a man who thinks and\r\nsuffers. His white eyelashes and lack of eyebrows induced the relentless\r\nBixiou to name him “the white rabbit.” Minard--the Rabourdin of a\r\nlower sphere--was filled with the desire of placing his Zelie in better\r\ncircumstances, and his mind searched the ocean of the wants of luxury in\r\nhopes of finding an idea, of making some discovery or some improvement\r\nwhich would bring him a rapid fortune. His apparent dulness was really\r\ncaused by the continual tension of his mind; he went over the history\r\nof Cephalic Oils and the Paste of Sultans, lucifer matches and\r\nportable gas, jointed sockets for hydrostatic lamps,--in short, all the\r\ninfinitely little inventions of material civilization which pay so well.\r\nHe bore Bixiou’s jests as a busy man bears the buzzing of an insect; he\r\nwas not even annoyed by them. In spite of his cleverness, Bixiou never\r\nperceived the profound contempt which Minard felt for him. Minard never\r\ndreamed of quarrelling, however,--regarding it as a loss of time. After\r\na while his composure tired out his tormentor. He always breakfasted\r\nwith his wife, and ate nothing at the office. Once a month he took Zelie\r\nto the theatre, with tickets bestowed by du Bruel or Bixiou; for Bixiou\r\nwas capable of anything, even of doing a kindness. Monsieur and Madame\r\nMinard paid their visits in person on New-Year’s day. Those who saw\r\nthem often asked how it was that a woman could keep her husband in good\r\nclothes, wear a Leghorn bonnet with flowers, embroidered muslin dresses,\r\nsilk mantles, prunella boots, handsome fichus, a Chinese parasol,\r\nand drive home in a hackney-coach, and yet be virtuous; while Madame\r\nColleville and other “ladies” of her kind could scarcely make ends meet,\r\nthough they had double Madame Minard’s means.\r\n\r\nIn the two bureaus were two clerks so devoted to each other that their\r\nfriendship became the butt of all the rest. He of the bureau Baudoyer,\r\nnamed Colleville, was chief-clerk, and would have been head of the\r\nbureau long before if the Restoration had never happened. His wife was\r\nas clever in her way as Madame Rabourdin in hers. Colleville, who was\r\nson of a first violin at the opera, fell in love with the daughter of a\r\ncelebrated danseuse. Flavie Minoret, one of those capable and charming\r\nParisian women who know how to make their husbands happy and yet\r\npreserve their own liberty, made the Colleville home a rendezvous for\r\nall our best artists and orators. Colleville’s humble position under\r\ngovernment was forgotten there. Flavie’s conduct gave such food for\r\ngossip, however, that Madame Rabourdin had declined all her invitations.\r\nThe friend in Rabourdin’s bureau to whom Colleville was so attached was\r\nnamed Thuillier. All who knew one knew the other. Thuillier, called “the\r\nhandsome Thuillier,” an ex-Lothario, led as idle a life as Colleville\r\nled a busy one. Colleville, government official in the mornings and\r\nfirst clarionet at the Opera-Comique at night, worked hard to maintain\r\nhis family, though he was not without influential friends. He was looked\r\nupon as a very shrewd man,--all the more, perhaps, because he hid his\r\nambitions under a show of indifference. Apparently content with his lot\r\nand liking work, he found every one, even the chiefs, ready to protect\r\nhis brave career. During the last few weeks Madame Colleville had made\r\nan evident change in the household, and seemed to be taking to piety.\r\nThis gave rise to a vague report in the bureaus that she thought of\r\nsecuring some more powerful influence than that of Francois Keller, the\r\nfamous orator, who had been one of her chief adorers, but who, so far,\r\nhad failed to obtain a better place for her husband. Flavie had, about\r\nthis time--and it was one of her mistakes--turned for help to des\r\nLupeaulx.\r\n\r\nColleville had a passion for reading the horoscopes of famous men in\r\nthe anagram of their names. He passed whole months in decomposing\r\nand recomposing words and fitting them to new meanings. “Un Corse la\r\nfinira,” found within the words, “Revolution Francaise”; “Eh, c’est\r\nlarge nez,” in “Charles Genest,” an abbe at the court of Louis XIV.,\r\nwhose huge nose is recorded by Saint-Simon as the delight of the Duc de\r\nBourgogne (the exigencies of this last anagram required the substitution\r\nof a z for an s),--were a never-ending marvel to Colleville. Raising\r\nthe anagram to the height of a science, he declared that the destiny of\r\nevery man was written in the words or phrase given by the transposition\r\nof the letters of his names and titles; and his patriotism struggled\r\nhard to suppress the fact--signal evidence for his theory--that in\r\nHoratio Nelson, “honor est a Nilo.” Ever since the accession of Charles\r\nX., he had bestowed much thought on the king’s anagram. Thuillier, who\r\nwas fond of making puns, declared that an anagram was nothing more than\r\na pun on letters. The sight of Colleville, a man of real feeling, bound\r\nalmost indissolubly to Thuillier, the model of an egoist, presented a\r\ndifficult problem to the mind of an observer. The clerks in the offices\r\nexplained it by saying, “Thuillier is rich, and the Colleville household\r\ncostly.” This friendship, however, consolidated by time, was based on\r\nfeelings and on facts which naturally explained it; an account of which\r\nmay be found elsewhere (see “Les Petits Bourgeois”). We may remark in\r\npassing that though Madame Colleville was well known in the bureaus, the\r\nexistence of Madame Thuillier was almost unknown there. Colleville,\r\nan active man, burdened with a family of children, was fat, round, and\r\njolly, whereas Thuillier, “the beau of the Empire” without apparent\r\nanxieties and always at leisure, was slender and thin, with a livid face\r\nand a melancholy air. “We never know,” said Rabourdin, speaking of the\r\ntwo men, “whether our friendships are born of likeness or of contrast.”\r\n\r\nUnlike these Siamese twins, two other clerks, Chazelle and Paulmier,\r\nwere forever squabbling. One smoked, the other took snuff, and the\r\nmerits of their respective use of tobacco were the origin of ceaseless\r\ndisputes. Chazelle’s home, which was tyrannized over by a wife,\r\nfurnished a subject of endless ridicule to Paulmier; whereas Paulmier,\r\na bachelor, often half-starved like Vimeux, with ragged clothes and\r\nhalf-concealed penury was a fruitful source of ridicule to Chazelle.\r\nBoth were beginning to show a protuberant stomach; Chazelle’s, which was\r\nround and projecting, had the impertinence, so Bixiou said, to enter the\r\nroom first; Paulmier’s corporation spread to right and left. A favorite\r\namusement with Bixiou was to measure them quarterly. The two clerks, by\r\ndint of quarrelling over the details of their lives, and washing much of\r\ntheir dirty linen at the office, had obtained the disrepute which they\r\nmerited. “Do you take me for a Chazelle?” was a frequent saying that\r\nserved to end many an annoying discussion.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Poiret junior, called “junior” to distinguish him from his\r\nbrother Monsieur Poiret senior (now living in the Maison Vanquer, where\r\nPoiret junior sometimes dined, intending to end his days in the same\r\nretreat), had spent thirty years in the Civil Service. Nature herself is\r\nnot so fixed and unvarying in her evolutions as was Poiret junior in all\r\nthe acts of his daily life; he always laid his things in precisely the\r\nsame place, put his pen in the same rack, sat down in his seat at the\r\nsame hour, warmed himself at the stove at the same moment of the day.\r\nHis sole vanity consisted in wearing an infallible watch, timed daily at\r\nthe Hotel de Ville as he passed it on his way to the office. From six\r\nto eight o’clock in the morning he kept the books of a large shop in the\r\nrue Saint-Antoine, and from six to eight o’clock in the evening those\r\nof the Maison Camusot, in the rue des Bourdonnais. He thus earned three\r\nthousand francs a year, counting his salary from the government. In a\r\nfew months his term of service would be up, when he would retire on a\r\npension; he therefore showed the utmost indifference to the political\r\nintrigues of the bureaus. Like his elder brother, to whom retirement\r\nfrom active service had proved a fatal blow, he would probably grow an\r\nold man when he could no longer come from his home to the ministry, sit\r\nin the same chair and copy a certain number of pages. Poiret’s eyes were\r\ndim, his glance weak and lifeless, his skin discolored and wrinkled,\r\ngray in tone and speckled with bluish dots; his nose flat, his lips\r\ndrawn inward to the mouth, where a few defective teeth still lingered.\r\nHis gray hair, flattened to the head by the pressure of his hat, gave\r\nhim the look of an ecclesiastic,--a resemblance he would scarcely have\r\nliked, for he hated priests and clergy, though he could give no reasons\r\nfor his anti-religious views. This antipathy, however, did not prevent\r\nhim from being extremely attached to whatever administration happened to\r\nbe in power. He never buttoned his old green coat, even on the coldest\r\ndays, and he always wore shoes with ties, and black trousers.\r\n\r\nNo human life was ever lived so thoroughly by rule. Poiret kept all\r\nhis receipted bills, even the most trifling, and all his account-books,\r\nwrapped in old shirts and put away according to their respective years\r\nfrom the time of his entrance at the ministry. Rough copies of his\r\nletters were dated and put away in a box, ticketed “My Correspondence.”\r\n He dined at the same restaurant (the Sucking Calf in the place du\r\nChatelet), and sat in the same place, which the waiters kept for him. He\r\nnever gave five minutes more time to the shop in the rue Saint Antoine\r\nthan justly belonged to it, and at half-past eight precisely he reached\r\nthe Cafe David, where he breakfasted and remained till eleven. There\r\nhe listened to political discussions, his arms crossed on his cane, his\r\nchin in his right hand, never saying a word. The dame du comptoir, the\r\nonly woman to whom he ever spoke with pleasure, was the sole confidant\r\nof the little events of his life, for his seat was close to her counter.\r\nHe played dominoes, the only game he was capable of understanding. When\r\nhis partners did not happen to be present, he usually went to sleep\r\nwith his back against the wainscot, holding a newspaper in his hand, the\r\nwooden file resting on the marble of his table. He was interested in the\r\nbuildings going up in Paris, and spent his Sundays in walking about to\r\nexamine them. He was often heard to say, “I saw the Louvre emerge from\r\nits rubbish; I saw the birth of the place du Chatelet, the quai aux\r\nFleurs and the Markets.” He and his brother, both born at Troyes, were\r\nsent in youth to serve their apprenticeship in a government office.\r\nTheir mother made herself notorious by misconduct, and the two brothers\r\nhad the grief of hearing of her death in the hospital at Troyes,\r\nalthough they had frequently sent money for her support. This event led\r\nthem both not only to abjure marriage, but to feel a horror of children;\r\nill at ease with them, they feared them as others fear madmen, and\r\nwatched them with haggard eyes.\r\n\r\nSince the day when he first came to Paris Poiret junior had never gone\r\noutside the city. He began at that time to keep a journal of his life,\r\nin which he noted down all the striking events of his day. Du Bruel\r\ntold him that Lord Byron did the same thing. This likeness filled\r\nPoiret junior with delight, and led him to buy the works of Lord Byron,\r\ntranslated by Chastopalli, of which he did not understand a word. At the\r\noffice he was often seen in a melancholy attitude, as though absorbed in\r\nthought, when in fact he was thinking of nothing at all. He did not know\r\na single person in the house where he lived, and always carried the keys\r\nof his apartment about with him. On New-Year’s day he went round and\r\nleft his own cards on all the clerks of the division. Bixiou took it\r\ninto his head on one of the hottest of dog-days to put a layer of lard\r\nunder the lining of a certain old hat which Poiret junior (he was, by\r\nthe bye, fifty-two years old) had worn for the last nine years. Bixiou,\r\nwho had never seen any other hat on Poiret’s head, dreamed of it\r\nand declared he tasted it in his food; he therefore resolved, in the\r\ninterests of his digestion, to relieve the bureau of the sight of that\r\namorphous old hat. Poiret junior left the office regularly at four\r\no’clock. As he walked along, the sun’s rays reflected from the\r\npavements and walls produced a tropical heat; he felt that his head was\r\ninundated,--he, who never perspired! Feeling that he was ill, or on the\r\npoint of being so, instead of going as usual to the Sucking Calf he went\r\nhome, drew out from his desk the journal of his life, and recorded the\r\nfact in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  “To-day, July 3, 1823, overtaken by extraordinary perspiration, a\r\n  sign, perhaps, of the sweating-sickness, a malady which prevails\r\n  in Champagne. I am about to consult Doctor Haudry. The disease\r\n  first appeared as I reached the highest part of the quai des\r\n  Ecoles.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly, having taken off his hat, he became aware that the mysterious\r\nsweat had some cause independent of his own person. He wiped his face,\r\nexamined the hat, and could find nothing, for he did not venture to take\r\nout the lining. All this he noted in his journal:--\r\n\r\n  “Carried my hat to the Sieur Tournan, hat-maker in the rue\r\n  Saint-Martin, for the reason that I suspect some unknown cause for\r\n  this perspiration, which, in that case, might not be perspiration,\r\n  but, possibly, the effect of something lately added, or formerly\r\n  done, to my hat.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Tournan at once informed his customer of the presence of a\r\ngreasy substance, obtained by the trying-out of the fat of a pig or sow.\r\nThe next day Poiret appeared at the office with another hat, lent by\r\nMonsieur Tournan while a new one was making; but he did not sleep that\r\nnight until he had added the following sentence to the preceding entries\r\nin his journal: “It is asserted that my hat contained lard, the fat of a\r\npig.”\r\n\r\nThis inexplicable fact occupied the intellect of Poiret junior for the\r\nspace of two weeks; and he never knew how the phenomenon was produced.\r\nThe clerks told him tales of showers of frogs, and other dog-day\r\nwonders, also the startling fact that an imprint of the head of Napoleon\r\nhad been found in the root of a young elm, with other eccentricities\r\nof natural history. Vimeux informed him that one day his hat--his,\r\nVimeux’s--had stained his forehead black, and that hat-makers were in\r\nthe habit of using drugs. After that Poiret paid many visits to Monsieur\r\nTournan to inquire into his methods of manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn the Rabourdin bureau was a clerk who played the man of courage\r\nand audacity, professed the opinions of the Left centre, and rebelled\r\nagainst the tyrannies of Baudoyer as exercised upon what he called the\r\nunhappy slaves of that office. His name was Fleury. He boldly subscribed\r\nto an opposition newspaper, wore a gray hat with a broad brim, red bands\r\non his blue trousers, a blue waistcoat with gilt buttons, and a\r\nsurtout coat crossed over the breast like that of a quartermaster of\r\ngendarmerie. Though unyielding in his opinions, he continued to be\r\nemployed in the service, all the while predicting a fatal end to a\r\ngovernment which persisted in upholding religion. He openly avowed his\r\nsympathy for Napoleon, now that the death of that great man put an end\r\nto the laws enacted against “the partisans of the usurper.” Fleury,\r\nex-captain of a regiment of the line under the Emperor, a tall, dark,\r\nhandsome fellow, was now, in addition to his civil-service post,\r\nbox-keeper at the Cirque-Olympique. Bixiou never ventured on tormenting\r\nFleury, for the rough trooper, who was a good shot and clever at\r\nfencing, seemed quite capable of extreme brutality if provoked. An\r\nardent subscriber to “Victoires et Conquetes,” Fleury nevertheless\r\nrefused to pay his subscription, though he kept and read the copies,\r\nalleging that they exceeded the number proposed in the prospectus. He\r\nadored Monsieur Rabourdin, who had saved him from dismissal, and was\r\neven heard to say that if any misfortune happened to the chief through\r\nanybody’s fault he would kill that person. Dutocq meanly courted Fleury\r\nbecause he feared him. Fleury, crippled with debt, played many a trick\r\non his creditors. Expert in legal matters, he never signed a promissory\r\nnote; and had prudently attached his own salary under the names of\r\nfictitious creditors, so that he was able to draw nearly the whole of it\r\nhimself. He played ecarte, was the life of evening parties, tossed off\r\nglasses of champagne without wetting his lips, and knew all the songs of\r\nBeranger by heart. He was proud of his full, sonorous voice. His three\r\ngreat admirations were Napoleon, Bolivar, and Beranger. Foy, Lafitte,\r\nand Casimir Delavigne he only esteemed. Fleury, as you will have guessed\r\nalready, was a Southerner, destined, no doubt, to become the responsible\r\neditor of a liberal journal.\r\n\r\nDesroys, the mysterious clerk of the division, consorted with no one,\r\ntalked little, and hid his private life so carefully that no one knew\r\nwhere he lived, nor who were his protectors, nor what were his means of\r\nsubsistence. Looking about them for the causes of this reserve, some\r\nof his colleagues thought him a “carbonaro,” others an Orleanist; there\r\nwere others again who doubted whether to call him a spy or a man of\r\nsolid merit. Desroys was, however, simple and solely the son of a\r\n“Conventionel,” who did not vote the king’s death. Cold and prudent by\r\ntemperament, he had judged the world and ended by relying on no one but\r\nhimself. Republican in secret, an admirer of Paul-Louis Courier and a\r\nfriend of Michael Chrestien, he looked to time and public intelligence\r\nto bring about the triumph of his opinions from end to end of Europe.\r\nHe dreamed of a new Germany and a new Italy. His heart swelled with that\r\ndull, collective love which we must call humanitarianism, the eldest son\r\nof deceased philanthropy, and which is to the divine catholic charity\r\nwhat system is to art, or reasoning to deed. This conscientious puritan\r\nof freedom, this apostle of an impossible equality, regretted keenly\r\nthat his poverty forced him to serve the government, and he made various\r\nefforts to find a place elsewhere. Tall, lean, lanky, and solemn in\r\nappearance, like a man who expects to be called some day to lay down his\r\nlife for a cause, he lived on a page of Volney, studied Saint-Just, and\r\nemployed himself on a vindication of Robespierre, whom he regarded as\r\nthe successor of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThe last of the individuals belonging to these bureaus who merits\r\na sketch here is the little La Billardiere. Having, to his great\r\nmisfortune, lost his mother, and being under the protection of the\r\nminister, safe therefore from the tyrannies of Baudoyer, and received\r\nin all the ministerial salons, he was nevertheless detested by every one\r\nbecause of his impertinence and conceit. The two chiefs were polite\r\nto him, but the clerks held him at arm’s length and prevented all\r\ncompanionship by means of the extreme and grotesque politeness which\r\nthey bestowed upon him. A pretty youth of twenty-two, tall and slender,\r\nwith the manners of an Englishman, a dandy in dress, curled and\r\nperfumed, gloved and booted in the latest fashion, and twirling an\r\neyeglass, Benjamin de la Billardiere thought himself a charming fellow\r\nand possessed all the vices of the world with none of its graces. He\r\nwas now looking forward impatiently to the death of his father, that\r\nhe might succeed to the title of baron. His cards were printed “le\r\nChevalier de la Billardiere” and on the wall of his office hung, in a\r\nframe, his coat of arms (sable, two swords in saltire, on a chief azure\r\nthree mullets argent; with the motto; “Toujours fidele”). Possessed\r\nwith a mania for talking heraldry, he once asked the young Vicomte de\r\nPortenduere why his arms were charged in a certain way, and drew down\r\nupon himself the happy answer, “I did not make them.” He talked of his\r\ndevotion to the monarchy and the attentions the Dauphine paid him. He\r\nstood very well with des Lupeaulx, whom he thought his friend, and they\r\noften breakfasted together. Bixiou posed as his mentor, and hoped to rid\r\nthe division and France of the young fool by tempting him to excesses,\r\nand openly avowed that intention.\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal figures of La Billardiere’s division of the\r\nministry, where also were other clerks of less account, who resembled\r\nmore or less those that are represented here. It is difficult even for\r\nan observer to decide from the aspect of these strange personalities\r\nwhether the goose-quill tribe were becoming idiots from the effects of\r\ntheir employment or whether they entered the service because they were\r\nnatural born fools. Possibly the making of them lies at the door of\r\nNature and of the government both. Nature, to a civil-service clerk is,\r\nin fact, the sphere of the office; his horizon is bounded on all\r\nsides by green boxes; to him, atmospheric changes are the air of\r\nthe corridors, the masculine exhalations contained in rooms without\r\nventilators, the odor of paper, pens, and ink; the soil he treads is\r\na tiled pavement or a wooden floor, strewn with a curious litter and\r\nmoistened by the attendant’s watering-pot; his sky is the ceiling toward\r\nwhich he yawns; his element is dust. Several distinguished doctors have\r\nremonstrated against the influence of this second nature, both savage\r\nand civilized, on the moral being vegetating in those dreadful pens\r\ncalled bureaus, where the sun seldom penetrates, where thoughts are tied\r\ndown to occupations like that of horses who turn a crank and who, poor\r\nbeasts, yawn distressingly and die quickly. Rabourdin was, therefore,\r\nfully justified in seeking to reform their present condition, by\r\nlessening their numbers and giving to each a larger salary and far\r\nheavier work. Men are neither wearied nor bored when doing great things.\r\nUnder the present system government loses fully four hours out of the\r\nnine which the clerks owe to the service,--hours wasted, as we shall\r\nsee, in conversations, in gossip, in disputes, and, above all, in\r\nunderhand intriguing. The reader must have haunted the bureaus of the\r\nministerial departments before he can realize how much their petty\r\nand belittling life resembles that of seminaries. Wherever men live\r\ncollectively this likeness is obvious; in regiments, in law-courts, you\r\nwill find the elements of the school on a smaller or larger scale. The\r\ngovernment clerks, forced to be together for nine hours of the day,\r\nlooked upon their office as a sort of class-room where they had tasks to\r\nperform, where the head of the bureau was no other than a schoolmaster,\r\nand where the gratuities bestowed took the place of prizes given out to\r\nproteges,--a place, moreover, where they teased and hated each other,\r\nand yet felt a certain comradeship, colder than that of a regiment,\r\nwhich itself is less hearty than that of seminaries. As a man advances\r\nin life he grows more selfish; egoism develops, and relaxes all the\r\nsecondary bonds of affection. A government office is, in short, a\r\nmicrocosm of society, with its oddities and hatreds, its envy and its\r\ncupidity, its determination to push on, no matter who goes under, its\r\nfrivolous gossip which gives so many wounds, and its perpetual spying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. THE MACHINE IN MOTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this moment the division of Monsieur de la Billardiere was in a state\r\nof unusual excitement, resulting very naturally from the event which was\r\nabout to happen; for heads of divisions do not die every day, and\r\nthere is no insurance office where the chances of life and death are\r\ncalculated with more sagacity than in a government bureau. Self-interest\r\nstifles all compassion, as it does in children, but the government\r\nservice adds hypocrisy to boot.\r\n\r\nThe clerks of the bureau Baudoyer arrived at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning, whereas those of the bureau Rabourdin seldom appeared till\r\nnine,--a circumstance which did not prevent the work in the latter\r\noffice from being more rapidly dispatched than that of the former.\r\nDutocq had important reasons for coming early on this particular\r\nmorning. The previous evening he had furtively entered the study\r\nwhere Sebastien was at work, and had seen him copying some papers\r\nfor Rabourdin; he concealed himself until he saw Sebastien leave the\r\npremises without taking any papers away with him. Certain, therefore,\r\nof finding the rather voluminous memorandum which he had seen, together\r\nwith its copy, in some corner of the study, he searched through the\r\nboxes one after another until he finally came upon the fatal list.\r\nHe carried it in hot haste to an autograph-printing house, where he\r\nobtained two pressed copies of the memorandum, showing, of course,\r\nRabourdin’s own writing. Anxious not to arouse suspicion, he had\r\ngone very early to the office and replaced both the memorandum and\r\nSebastien’s copy in the box from which he had taken them. Sebastien,\r\nwho was kept up till after midnight at Madame Rabourdin’s party, was, in\r\nspite of his desire to get to the office early, preceded by the spirit\r\nof hatred. Hatred lived in the rue Saint-Louis-Saint-Honore, whereas\r\nlove and devotion lived far-off in the rue du Roi-Dore in the Marais.\r\nThis slight delay was destined to affect Rabourdin’s whole career.\r\n\r\nSebastien opened his box eagerly, found the memorandum and his own\r\nunfinished copy all in order, and locked them at once into the desk as\r\nRabourdin had directed. The mornings are dark in these offices towards\r\nthe end of December, sometimes indeed the lamps are lit till after ten\r\no’clock; consequently Sebastien did not happen to notice the pressure\r\nof the copying-machine upon the paper. But when, about half-past nine\r\no’clock, Rabourdin looked at his memorandum he saw at once the effects\r\nof the copying process, and all the more readily because he was then\r\nconsidering whether these autographic presses could not be made to do\r\nthe work of copying clerks.\r\n\r\n“Did any one get to the office before you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Sebastien,--“Monsieur Dutocq.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, he was punctual. Send Antoine to me.”\r\n\r\nToo noble to distress Sebastien uselessly by blaming him for a\r\nmisfortune now beyond remedy, Rabourdin said no more. Antoine came.\r\nRabourdin asked if any clerk had remained at the office after four\r\no’clock the previous evening. The man replied that Monsieur Dutocq had\r\nworked there later than Monsieur de la Roche, who was usually the last\r\nto leave. Rabourdin dismissed him with a nod, and resumed the thread of\r\nhis reflections.\r\n\r\n“Twice I have prevented his dismissal,” he said to himself, “and this is\r\nmy reward.”\r\n\r\nThis morning was to Rabourdin like the solemn hour in which great\r\ncommanders decide upon a battle and weigh all chances. Knowing the\r\nspirit of official life better than any one, he well knew that it would\r\nnever pardon, any more than a school or the galleys or the army pardon,\r\nwhat looked like espionage or tale-bearing. A man capable of informing\r\nagainst his comrades is disgraced, dishonored, despised; the ministers\r\nin such a case would disavow their own agents. Nothing was left to an\r\nofficial so placed but to send in his resignation and leave Paris; his\r\nhonor is permanently stained; explanations are of no avail; no one will\r\neither ask for them or listen to them. A minister may well do the same\r\nthing and be thought a great man, able to choose the right instruments;\r\nbut a mere subordinate will be judged as a spy, no matter what may\r\nbe his motives. While justly measuring the folly of such judgment,\r\nRabourdin knew that it was all-powerful; and he knew, too, that he was\r\ncrushed. More surprised than overwhelmed, he now sought for the best\r\ncourse to follow under the circumstances; and with such thoughts in his\r\nmind he was necessarily aloof from the excitement caused in the division\r\nby the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere; in fact he did not hear of\r\nit until young La Briere, who was able to appreciate his sterling value,\r\ncame to tell him. About ten o’clock, in the bureau Baudoyer, Bixiou\r\nwas relating the last moments of the life of the director to Minard,\r\nDesroys, Monsieur Godard, whom he had called from his private office,\r\nand Dutocq, who had rushed in with private motives of his own.\r\nColleville and Chazelle were absent.\r\n\r\nBixiou [standing with his back to the stove and holding up the sole\r\nof each boot alternately to dry at the open door]. “This morning, at\r\nhalf-past seven, I went to inquire after our most worthy and respectable\r\ndirector, knight of the order of Christ, et caetera, et caetera. Yes,\r\ngentlemen, last night he was a being with twenty et caeteras, to-day he\r\nis nothing, not even a government clerk. I asked all particulars of his\r\nnurse. She told me that this morning at five o’clock he became uneasy\r\nabout the royal family. He asked for the names of all the clerks who had\r\ncalled to inquire after him; and then he said: ‘Fill my snuff-box,\r\ngive me the newspaper, bring my spectacles, and change my ribbon of the\r\nLegion of honor,--it is very dirty.’ I suppose you know he always wore\r\nhis orders in bed. He was fully conscious, retained his senses and all\r\nhis usual ideas. But, presto! ten minutes later the water rose, rose,\r\nrose and flooded his chest; he knew he was dying for he felt the cysts\r\nbreak. At that fatal moment he gave evident proof of his powerful mind\r\nand vast intellect. Ah, we never rightly appreciated him! We used to\r\nlaugh at him and call him a booby--didn’t you, Monsieur Godard?”\r\n\r\nGodard. “I? I always rated Monsieur de la Billardiere’s talents higher\r\nthan the rest of you.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “You and he could understand each other!”\r\n\r\nGodard. “He wasn’t a bad man; he never harmed any one.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “To do harm you must do something, and he never did anything. If\r\nit wasn’t you who said he was a dolt, it must have been Minard.”\r\n\r\nMinard [shrugging his shoulders]. “I!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Well, then it was you, Dutocq!” [Dutocq made a vehement gesture\r\nof denial.] “Oh! very good, then it was nobody. Every one in this office\r\nknew his intellect was herculean. Well, you were right. He ended, as I\r\nhave said, like the great man that he was.”\r\n\r\nDesroys [impatiently]. “Pray what did he do that was so great? he had\r\nthe weakness to confess himself.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Yes, monsieur, he received the holy sacraments. But do you\r\nknow what he did in order to receive them? He put on his uniform as\r\ngentleman-in-ordinary of the Bedchamber, with all his orders, and had\r\nhimself powdered; they tied his queue (that poor queue!) with a fresh\r\nribbon. Now I say that none but a man of remarkable character would have\r\nhis queue tied with a fresh ribbon just as he was dying. There are eight\r\nof us here, and I don’t believe one among us is capable of such an act.\r\nBut that’s not all; he said,--for you know all celebrated men make a\r\ndying speech; he said,--stop now, what did he say? Ah! he said, ‘I must\r\nattire myself to meet the King of Heaven,--I, who have so often dressed\r\nin my best for audience with the kings of earth.’ That’s how Monsieur de\r\nla Billardiere departed this life. He took upon himself to justify the\r\nsaying of Pythagoras, ‘No man is known until he dies.’”\r\n\r\nColleville [rushing in]. “Gentlemen, great news!”\r\n\r\nAll. “We know it.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “I defy you to know it! I have been hunting for it ever\r\nsince the accession of His Majesty to the thrones of France and of\r\nNavarre. Last night I succeeded! but with what labor! Madame Colleville\r\nasked me what was the matter.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Do you think we have time to bother ourselves with your\r\nintolerable anagrams when the worthy Monsieur de la Billardiere has just\r\nexpired?”\r\n\r\nColleville. “That’s Bixiou’s nonsense! I have just come from Monsieur\r\nde la Billardiere’s; he is still living, though they expect him to die\r\nsoon.” [Godard, indignant at the hoax, goes off grumbling.] “Gentlemen!\r\nyou would never guess what extraordinary events are revealed by the\r\nanagram of this sacramental sentence” [he pulls out a piece of paper\r\nand reads], “Charles dix, par la grace de Dieu, roi de France et de\r\nNavarre.”\r\n\r\nGodard [re-entering]. “Tell what it is at once, and don’t keep people\r\nwaiting.”\r\n\r\nColleville [triumphantly unfolding the rest of the paper]. “Listen!\r\n\r\n  “A H. V. il cedera;\r\n  De S. C. l. d. partira;\r\n  Eh nauf errera,\r\n  Decide a Gorix.\r\n\r\n“Every letter is there!” [He repeats it.] “A Henry cinq cedera (his\r\ncrown of course); de Saint-Cloud partira; en nauf (that’s an old French\r\nword for skiff, vessel, felucca, corvette, anything you like) errera--”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “What a tissue of absurdities! How can the King cede his crown\r\nto Henry V., who, according to your nonsense, must be his grandson,\r\nwhen Monseigneur le Dauphin is living. Are you prophesying the Dauphin’s\r\ndeath?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “What’s Gorix, pray?--the name of a cat?”\r\n\r\nColleville [provoked]. “It is the archaeological and lapidarial\r\nabbreviation of the name of a town, my good friend; I looked it out in\r\nMalte-Brun: Goritz, in Latin Gorixia, situated in Bohemia or Hungary, or\r\nit may be Austria--”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Tyrol, the Basque provinces, or South America. Why don’t you\r\nset it all to music and play it on the clarionet?”\r\n\r\nGodard [shrugging his shoulders and departing]. “What utter nonsense!”\r\n\r\nColleville. “Nonsense! nonsense indeed! It is a pity you don’t take the\r\ntrouble to study fatalism, the religion of the Emperor Napoleon.”\r\n\r\nGodard [irritated at Colleville’s tone]. “Monsieur Colleville, let me\r\ntell you that Bonaparte may perhaps be styled Emperor by historians,\r\nbut it is extremely out of place to refer to him as such in a government\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [laughing]. “Get an anagram out of that, my dear fellow.”\r\n\r\nColleville [angrily]. “Let me tell you that if Napoleon Bonaparte had\r\nstudied the letters of his name on the 14th of April, 1814, he might\r\nperhaps be Emperor still.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “How do you make that out?”\r\n\r\nColleville [solemnly]. “Napoleon Bonaparte.--No, appear not at Elba!”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “You’ll lose your place for talking such nonsense.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “If my place is taken from me, Francois Keller will make it\r\nhot for your minister.” [Dead silence.] “I’d have you to know, Master\r\nDutocq, that all known anagrams have actually come to pass. Look\r\nhere,--you, yourself,--don’t you marry, for there’s ‘coqu’ in your\r\nname.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [interrupting]. “And d, t, for de-testable.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [without seeming angry]. “I don’t care, as long as it is only in\r\nmy name. Why don’t you anagrammatize, or whatever you call it, ‘Xavier\r\nRabourdin, chef du bureau’?”\r\n\r\nColleville. “Bless you, so I have!”\r\n\r\nBixiou [mending his pen]. “And what did you make of it?”\r\n\r\nColleville. “It comes out as follows: D’abord reva bureaux, E-u,--(you\r\ncatch the meaning? et eut--and had) E-u fin riche; which signifies that\r\nafter first belonging to the administration, he gave it up and got rich\r\nelsewhere.” [Repeats.] “D’abord reva bureaux, E-u fin riche.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “That IS queer!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Try Isidore Baudoyer.”\r\n\r\nColleville [mysteriously]. “I sha’n’t tell the other anagrams to any one\r\nbut Thuillier.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “I’ll bet you a breakfast that I can tell that one myself.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “And I’ll pay if you find it out.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Then I shall breakfast at your expense; but you won’t be angry,\r\nwill you? Two such geniuses as you and I need never conflict. ‘Isidore\r\nBaudoyer’ anagrams into ‘Ris d’aboyeur d’oie.’”\r\n\r\nColleville [petrified with amazement]. “You stole it from me!”\r\n\r\nBixiou [with dignity]. “Monsieur Colleville, do me the honor to believe\r\nthat I am rich enough in absurdity not to steal my neighbor’s nonsense.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [entering with a bundle of papers in his hand]. “Gentlemen, I\r\nrequest you to shout a little louder; you bring this office into such\r\nhigh repute with the administration. My worthy coadjutor, Monsieur\r\nClergeot, did me the honor just now to come and ask a question, and he\r\nheard the noise you are making” [passes into Monsieur Godard’s room].\r\n\r\nBixiou [in a low voice]. “The watch-dog is very tame this morning;\r\nthere’ll be a change of weather before night.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [whispering to Bixiou]. “I have something I want to say to you.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [fingering Dutocq’s waistcoat]. “You’ve a pretty waistcoat, that\r\ncost you nothing; is that what you want to say?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Nothing, indeed! I never paid so dear for anything in my life.\r\nThat stuff cost six francs a yard in the best shop in the rue de la\r\nPaix,--a fine dead stuff, the very thing for deep mourning.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “You know about engravings and such things, my dear fellow, but\r\nyou are totally ignorant of the laws of etiquette. Well, no man can be\r\na universal genius! Silk is positively not admissible in deep mourning.\r\nDon’t you see I am wearing woollen? Monsieur Rabourdin, Monsieur\r\nBaudoyer, and the minister are all in woollen; so is the faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain. There’s no one here but Minard who doesn’t wear woollen;\r\nhe’s afraid of being taken for a sheep. That’s the reason why he didn’t\r\nput on mourning for Louis XVIII.”\r\n\r\n[During this conversation Baudoyer is sitting by the fire in Godard’s\r\nroom, and the two are conversing in a low voice.]\r\n\r\nBaudoyer. “Yes, the worthy man is dying. The two ministers are both with\r\nhim. My father-in-law has been notified of the event. If you want to do\r\nme a signal service you will take a cab and go and let Madame Baudoyer\r\nknow what is happening; for Monsieur Saillard can’t leave his desk, nor\r\nI my office. Put yourself at my wife’s orders; do whatever she wishes.\r\nShe has, I believe, some ideas of her own, and wants to take certain\r\nsteps simultaneously.” [The two functionaries go out together.]\r\n\r\nGodard. “Monsieur Bixiou, I am obliged to leave the office for the rest\r\nof the day. You will take my place.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [to Bixiou, benignly]. “Consult me, if there is any necessity.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “This time, La Billardiere is really dead.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [in Bixiou’s ear]. “Come outside a minute.” [The two go into the\r\ncorridor and gaze at each other like birds of ill-omen.]\r\n\r\nDutocq [whispering]. “Listen. Now is the time for us to understand each\r\nother and push our way. What would you say to your being made head of\r\nthe bureau, and I under you?”\r\n\r\nBixiou [shrugging his shoulders]. “Come, come, don’t talk nonsense!”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “If Baudoyer gets La Billardiere’s place Rabourdin won’t stay\r\non where he is. Between ourselves, Baudoyer is so incapable that if du\r\nBruel and you don’t help him he will certainly be dismissed in a couple\r\nof months. If I know arithmetic that will give three empty places for us\r\nto fill--”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Three places right under our noses, which will certainly\r\nbe given to some bloated favorite, some spy, some pious fraud,--to\r\nColleville perhaps, whose wife has ended where all pretty women end--in\r\npiety.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “No, to /you/, my dear fellow, if you will only, for once in\r\nyour life, use your wits logically.” [He stopped as if to study the\r\neffect of his adverb in Bixiou’s face.] “Come, let us play fair.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [stolidly]. “Let me see your game.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “I don’t wish to be anything more than under-head-clerk. I know\r\nmyself perfectly well, and I know I haven’t the ability, like you, to\r\nbe head of a bureau. Du Bruel can be director, and you the head of this\r\nbureau; he will leave you his place as soon as he has made his pile;\r\nand as for me, I shall swim with the tide comfortably, under your\r\nprotection, till I can retire on a pension.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Sly dog! but how to you expect to carry out a plan which\r\nmeans forcing the minister’s hand and ejecting a man of talent? Between\r\nourselves, Rabourdin is the only man capable of taking charge of the\r\ndivision, and I might say of the ministry. Do you know that they talk\r\nof putting in over his head that solid lump of foolishness, that cube of\r\nidiocy, Baudoyer?”\r\n\r\nDutocq [consequentially]. “My dear fellow, I am in a position to rouse\r\nthe whole division against Rabourdin. You know how devoted Fleury is to\r\nhim? Well, I can make Fleury despise him.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Despised by Fleury!”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Not a soul will stand by Rabourdin; the clerks will go in a\r\nbody and complain of him to the minister,--not only in our division, but\r\nin all the divisions--”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Forward, march! infantry, cavalry, artillery, and marines of\r\nthe guard! You rave, my good fellow! And I, what part am I to take in\r\nthe business?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “You are to make a cutting caricature,--sharp enough to kill a\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “How much will you pay for it?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “A hundred francs.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [to himself]. “Then there is something in it.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [continuing]. “You must represent Rabourdin dressed as a butcher\r\n(make it a good likeness), find analogies between a kitchen and a\r\nbureau, put a skewer in his hand, draw portraits of the principal clerks\r\nand stick their heads on fowls, put them in a monstrous coop labelled\r\n‘Civil Service executions’; make him cutting the throat of one, and\r\nsupposed to take the others in turn. You can have geese and ducks with\r\nheads like ours,--you understand! Baudoyer, for instance, he’ll make an\r\nexcellent turkey-buzzard.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Ris d’aboyeur d’oie!” [He has watched Dutocq carefully for some\r\ntime.] “Did you think of that yourself?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Yes, I myself.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [to himself]. “Do evil feelings bring men to the same result as\r\ntalents?” [Aloud] “Well, I’ll do it” [Dutocq makes a motion of delight]\r\n“--when” [full stop] “--I know where I am and what I can rely on. If you\r\ndon’t succeed I shall lose my place, and I must make a living. You are a\r\ncurious kind of innocent still, my dear colleague.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Well, you needn’t make the lithograph till success is proved.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Why don’t you come out and tell me the whole truth?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “I must first see how the land lays in the bureau; we will talk\r\nabout it later” [goes off].\r\n\r\nBixiou [alone in the corridor]. “That fish, for he’s more a fish than\r\na bird, that Dutocq has a good idea in his head--I’m sure I don’t know\r\nwhere he stole it. If Baudoyer should succeed La Billardiere it would\r\nbe fun, more than fun--profit!” [Returns to the office.] “Gentlemen, I\r\nannounce glorious changes; papa La Billardiere is dead, really dead,--no\r\nnonsense, word of honor! Godard is off on business for our excellent\r\nchief Baudoyer, successor presumptive to the deceased.” [Minard,\r\nDesroys, and Colleville raise their heads in amazement; they all lay\r\ndown their pens, and Colleville blows his nose.] “Every one of us is\r\nto be promoted! Colleville will be under-head-clerk at the very least.\r\nMinard may have my place as chief clerk--why not? he is quite as dull as\r\nI am. Hey, Minard, if you should get twenty-five hundred francs a-year\r\nyour little wife would be uncommonly pleased, and you could buy yourself\r\na pair of boots now and then.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “But you don’t get twenty-five hundred francs.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Monsieur Dutocq gets that in Rabourdin’s office; why shouldn’t\r\nI get it this year? Monsieur Baudoyer gets it.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “Only through the influence of Monsieur Saillard. No other\r\nchief clerk gets that in any of the divisions.”\r\n\r\nPaulmier. “Bah! Hasn’t Monsieur Cochin three thousand? He succeeded\r\nMonsieur Vavasseur, who served ten years under the Empire at four\r\nthousand. His salary was dropped to three when the King first returned;\r\nthen to two thousand five hundred before Vavasseur died. But Monsieur\r\nCochin, who succeeded him, had influence enough to get the salary put\r\nback to three thousand.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “Monsieur Cochin signs E. A. L. Cochin (he is named\r\nEmile-Adolphe-Lucian), which, when anagrammed, gives Cochineal.\r\nNow observe, he’s a partner in a druggist’s business in the rue des\r\nLombards, the Maison Matifat, which made its fortune by that identical\r\ncolonial product.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [entering]. “Monsieur Chazelle, I see, is not here; you will be\r\ngood enough to say I asked for him, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [who had hastily stuck a hat on Chazelle’s chair when he heard\r\nBaudoyer’s step]. “Excuse me, Monsieur, but Chazelle has gone to the\r\nRabourdins’ to make an inquiry.”\r\n\r\nChazelle [entering with his hat on his head, and not seeing Baudoyer].\r\n“La Billardiere is done for, gentlemen! Rabourdin is head of the\r\ndivision and Master of petitions; he hasn’t stolen /his/ promotion,\r\nthat’s very certain.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [to Chazelle]. “You found that appointment in your second hat,\r\nI presume” [points to the hat on the chair]. “This is the third time\r\nwithin a month that you have come after nine o’clock. If you continue\r\nthe practice you will get on--elsewhere.” [To Bixiou, who is reading the\r\nnewspaper.] “My dear Monsieur Bixiou, do pray leave the newspapers to\r\nthese gentlemen who are going to breakfast, and come into my office for\r\nyour orders for the day. I don’t know what Monsieur Rabourdin wants with\r\nGabriel; he keeps him to do his private errands, I believe. I’ve rung\r\nthree times and can’t get him.” [Baudoyer and Bixiou retire into the\r\nprivate office.]\r\n\r\nChazelle. “Damned unlucky!”\r\n\r\nPaulmier [delighted to annoy Chazelle]. “Why didn’t you look about when\r\nyou came into the room? You might have seen the elephant, and the hat\r\ntoo; they are big enough to be visible.”\r\n\r\nChazelle [dismally]. “Disgusting business! I don’t see why we should\r\nbe treated like slaves because the government gives us four francs and\r\nsixty-five centimes a day.”\r\n\r\nFleury [entering]. “Down with Baudoyer! hurrah for Rabourdin!--that’s\r\nthe cry in the division.”\r\n\r\nChazelle [getting more and more angry]. “Baudoyer can turn off me if\r\nhe likes, I sha’n’t care. In Paris there are a thousand ways of earning\r\nfive francs a day; why, I could earn that at the Palais de Justice,\r\ncopying briefs for the lawyers.”\r\n\r\nPaulmier [still prodding him]. “It is very easy to say that; but a\r\ngovernment place is a government place, and that plucky Colleville, who\r\nworks like a galley-slave outside of this office, and who could earn,\r\nif he lost his appointment, more than his salary, prefers to keep his\r\nplace. Who the devil is fool enough to give up his expectations?”\r\n\r\nChazelle [continuing his philippic]. “You may not be, but I am! We have\r\nno chances at all. Time was when nothing was more encouraging than a\r\ncivil-service career. So many men were in the army that there were not\r\nenough for the government work; the maimed and the halt and the sick\r\nones, like Paulmier, and the near-sighted ones, all had their chance of\r\na rapid promotion. But now, ever since the Chamber invented what they\r\ncalled special training, and the rules and regulations for civil-service\r\nexaminers, we are worse off than common soldiers. The poorest places\r\nare at the mercy of a thousand mischances because we are now ruled by a\r\nthousand sovereigns.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [returning]. “Are you crazy, Chazelle? Where do you find a\r\nthousand sovereigns?--not in your pocket, are they?”\r\n\r\nChazelle. “Count them up. There are four hundred over there at the end\r\nof the pont de la Concorde (so called because it leads to the scene\r\nof perpetual discord between the Right and Left of the Chamber); three\r\nhundred more at the end of the rue de Tournon. The court, which ought to\r\ncount for the other three hundred, has seven hundred parts less power\r\nto get a man appointed to a place under government than the Emperor\r\nNapoleon had.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “All of which signifies that in a country where there are three\r\npowers you may bet a thousand to one that a government clerk who has no\r\ninfluence but his own merits to advance him will remain in obscurity.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [looking alternately at Chazelle and Fleury]. “My sons, you have\r\nyet to learn that in these days the worst state of life is the state of\r\nbelonging to the State.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Because it has a constitutional government.”\r\n\r\nColleville. “Gentlemen, gentlemen! no politics!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Fleury is right. Serving the State in these days is no longer\r\nserving a prince who knew how to punish and reward. The State now is\r\n/everybody/. Everybody of course cares for nobody. Serve everybody, and\r\nyou serve nobody. Nobody is interested in nobody; the government clerk\r\nlives between two negations. The world has neither pity nor respect,\r\nneither heart nor head; everybody forgets to-morrow the service of\r\nyesterday. Now each one of you may be, like Monsieur Baudoyer, an\r\nadministrative genius, a Chateaubriand of reports, a Bossouet of\r\ncirculars, the Canalis of memorials, the gifted son of diplomatic\r\ndespatches; but I tell you there is a fatal law which interferes with\r\nall administrative genius,--I mean the law of promotion by average. This\r\naverage is based on the statistics of promotion and the statistics\r\nof mortality combined. It is very certain that on entering whichever\r\nsection of the Civil Service you please at the age of eighteen, you\r\ncan’t get eighteen hundred francs a year till you reach the age of\r\nthirty. Now there’s no free and independent career in which, in\r\nthe course of twelve years, a young man who has gone through the\r\ngrammar-school, been vaccinated, is exempt from military service, and\r\npossesses all his faculties (I don’t mean transcendent ones) can’t amass\r\na capital of forty-five thousand francs in centimes, which represents\r\na permanent income equal to our salaries, which are, after all,\r\nprecarious. In twelve years a grocer can earn enough to give him ten\r\nthousand francs a year; a painter can daub a mile of canvas and be\r\ndecorated with the Legion of honor, or pose as a neglected genius. A\r\nliterary man becomes professor of something or other, or a journalist\r\nat a hundred francs for a thousand lines; he writes ‘feuilletons,’ or\r\nhe gets into Saint-Pelagie for a brilliant article that offends the\r\nJesuits,--which of course is an immense benefit to him and makes him a\r\npolitician at once. Even a lazy man, who does nothing but make debts,\r\nhas time to marry a widow who pays them; a priest finds time to become a\r\nbishop ‘in partibus.’ A sober, intelligent young fellow, who begins\r\nwith a small capital as a money-changer, soon buys a share in a broker’s\r\nbusiness; and, to go even lower, a petty clerk becomes a notary, a\r\nrag-picker lays by two or three thousand francs a year, and the poorest\r\nworkmen often become manufacturers; whereas, in the rotatory movement\r\nof this present civilization, which mistakes perpetual division and\r\nredivision for progress, an unhappy civil service clerk, like Chazelle\r\nfor instance, is forced to dine for twenty-two sous a meal, struggles\r\nwith his tailor and bootmaker, gets into debt, and is an absolute\r\nnothing; worse than that, he becomes an idiot! Come, gentlemen, now’s\r\nthe time to make a stand! Let us all give in our resignations! Fleury,\r\nChazelle, fling yourselves into other employments and become the great\r\nmen you really are.”\r\n\r\nChazelle [calmed down by Bixiou’s allocution]. “No, I thank you”\r\n [general laughter].\r\n\r\nBixiou. “You are wrong; in your situation I should try to get ahead of\r\nthe general-secretary.”\r\n\r\nChazelle [uneasily]. “What has he to do with me?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “You’ll find out; do you suppose Baudoyer will overlook what\r\nhappened just now?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Another piece of Bixiou’s spite! You’ve a queer fellow to deal\r\nwith in there. Now, Monsieur Rabourdin,--there’s a man for you! He put\r\nwork on my table to-day that you couldn’t get through within this office\r\nin three days; well, he expects me to have it done by four o’clock\r\nto-day. But he is not always at my heels to hinder me from talking to my\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [appearing at the door]. “Gentlemen, you will admit that if\r\nyou have the legal right to find fault with the chamber and the\r\nadministration you must at least do so elsewhere than in this office.”\r\n [To Fleury.] “What are you doing here, monsieur?”\r\n\r\nFleury [insolently]. “I came to tell these gentlemen that there was to\r\nbe a general turn-out. Du Bruel is sent for to the ministry, and Dutocq\r\nalso. Everybody is asking who will be appointed.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [retiring]. “It is not your affair, sir; go back to your own\r\noffice, and do not disturb mine.”\r\n\r\nFleury [in the doorway]. “It would be a shameful injustice if Rabourdin\r\nlost the place; I swear I’d leave the service. Did you find that\r\nanagram, papa Colleville?”\r\n\r\nColleville. “Yes, here it is.”\r\n\r\nFleury [leaning over Colleville’s desk]. “Capital! famous! This is just\r\nwhat will happen if the administration continues to play the hypocrite.”\r\n [He makes a sign to the clerks that Baudoyer is listening.] “If the\r\ngovernment would frankly state its intentions without concealments\r\nof any kind, the liberals would know what they had to deal with. An\r\nadministration which sets its best friends against itself, such men as\r\nthose of the ‘Debats,’ Chateaubriand, and Royer-Collard, is only to be\r\npitied!”\r\n\r\nColleville [after consulting his colleagues]. “Come, Fleury, you’re a\r\ngood fellow, but don’t talk politics here; you don’t know what harm you\r\nmay do us.”\r\n\r\nFleury [dryly]. “Well, adieu, gentlemen; I have my work to do by four\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\nWhile this idle talk had been going on, des Lupeaulx was closeted in\r\nhis office with du Bruel, where, a little later, Dutocq joined them. Des\r\nLupeaulx had heard from his valet of La Billardiere’s death, and wishing\r\nto please the two ministers, he wanted an obituary article to appear in\r\nthe evening papers.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, my dear du Bruel,” said the semi-minister to the\r\nhead-clerk as he entered, and not inviting him to sit down. “You have\r\nheard the news? La Billardiere is dead. The ministers were both\r\npresent when he received the last sacraments. The worthy man strongly\r\nrecommended Rabourdin, saying he should die with less regret if he could\r\nknow that his successor were the man who had so constantly done his\r\nwork. Death is a torture which makes a man confess everything. The\r\nminister agreed the more readily because his intention and that of the\r\nCouncil was to reward Monsieur Rabourdin’s numerous services. In fact,\r\nthe Council of State needs his experience. They say that young La\r\nBillardiere is to leave the division of his father and go to the\r\nCommission of Seals; that’s just the same as if the King had made him a\r\npresent of a hundred thousand francs,--the place can always be sold. But\r\nI know the news will delight your division, which will thus get rid of\r\nhim. Du Bruel, we must get ten or a dozen lines about the worthy late\r\ndirector into the papers; his Excellency will glance them over,--he\r\nreads the papers. Do you know the particulars of old La Billardiere’s\r\nlife?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel made a sign in the negative.\r\n\r\n“No?” continued des Lupeaulx. “Well then; he was mixed up in the affairs\r\nof La Vendee, and he was one of the confidants of the late King. Like\r\nMonsieur le Comte de Fontaine he always refused to hold communication\r\nwith the First Consul. He was a bit of a ‘chouan’; born in Brittany of a\r\nparliamentary family, and ennobled by Louis XVIII. How old was he? never\r\nmind about that; just say his loyalty was untarnished, his religion\r\nenlightened,--the poor old fellow hated churches and never set foot\r\nin one, but you had better make him out a ‘pious vassal.’ Bring in,\r\ngracefully, that he sang the song of Simeon at the accession of Charles\r\nX. The Comte d’Artois thought very highly of La Billardiere, for he\r\nco-operated in the unfortunate affair of Quiberon and took the\r\nwhole responsibility on himself. You know about that, don’t you? La\r\nBillardiere defended the King in a printed pamphlet in reply to an\r\nimpudent history of the Revolution written by a journalist; you can\r\nallude to his loyalty and devotion. But be very careful what you say;\r\nweigh your words, so that the other newspapers can’t laugh at us; and\r\nbring me the article when you’ve written it. Were you at Rabourdin’s\r\nyesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur,” said du Bruel, “Ah! beg pardon.”\r\n\r\n“No harm done,” answered des Lupeaulx, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Madame Rabourdin looked delightfully handsome,” added du Bruel. “There\r\nare not two women like her in Paris. Some are as clever as she, but\r\nthere’s not one so gracefully witty. Many women may even be handsomer,\r\nbut it would be hard to find one with such variety of beauty. Madame\r\nRabourdin is far superior to Madame Colleville,” said the vaudevillist,\r\nremembering des Lupeaulx’s former affair. “Flavie owes what she is to\r\nthe men about her, whereas Madame Rabourdin is all things in herself. It\r\nis wonderful too what she knows; you can’t tell secrets in Latin before\r\n/her/. If I had such a wife, I know I should succeed in everything.”\r\n\r\n“You have more mind than an author ought to have,” returned des\r\nLupeaulx, with a conceited air. Then he turned round and perceived\r\nDutocq. “Ah, good-morning, Dutocq,” he said. “I sent for you to lend me\r\nyour Charlet--if you have the whole complete. Madame la comtesse knows\r\nnothing of Charlet.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel retired.\r\n\r\n“Why do you come in without being summoned?” said des Lupeaulx, harshly,\r\nwhen he and Dutocq were left alone. “Is the State in danger that you\r\nmust come here at ten o’clock in the morning, just as I am going to\r\nbreakfast with his Excellency?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is, monsieur,” said Dutocq, dryly. “If I had had the honor\r\nto see you earlier, you would probably have not been so willing to\r\nsupport Monsieur Rabourdin, after reading his opinion of you.”\r\n\r\nDutocq opened his coat, took a paper from the left-hand breast-pocket\r\nand laid it on des Lupeaulx’s desk, pointing to a marked passage. Then\r\nhe went to the door and slipped the bolt, fearing interruption. While\r\nhe was thus employed, the secretary-general read the opening sentence of\r\nthe article, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Monsieur des Lupeaulx. A government degrades itself by openly\r\n  employing such a man, whose real vocation is for police diplomacy.\r\n  He is fitted to deal with the political filibusters of other\r\n  cabinets, and it would be a pity therefore to employ him on our\r\n  internal detective police. He is above a common spy, for he is\r\n  able to understand a plan; he could skilfully carry through a dark\r\n  piece of work and cover his retreat safely.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx was succinctly analyzed in five or six such\r\nparagraphs,--the essence, in fact, of the biographical portrait which\r\nwe gave at the beginning of this history. As he read the words the\r\nsecretary felt that a man stronger than himself sat in judgment on\r\nhim; and he at once resolved to examine the memorandum, which evidently\r\nreached far and high, without allowing Dutocq to know his secret\r\nthoughts. He therefore showed a calm, grave face when the spy returned\r\nto him. Des Lupeaulx, like lawyers, magistrates, diplomatists, and all\r\nwhose work obliges them to pry into the human heart, was past being\r\nsurprised at anything. Hardened in treachery and in all the tricks and\r\nwiles of hatred, he could take a stab in the back and not let his face\r\ntell of it.\r\n\r\n“How did you get hold of this paper?”\r\n\r\nDutocq related his good luck; des Lupeaulx’s face as he listened\r\nexpressed no approbation; and the spy ended in terror an account which\r\nbegan triumphantly.\r\n\r\n“Dutocq, you have put your finger between the bark and the tree,” said\r\nthe secretary, coldly. “If you don’t want to make powerful enemies I\r\nadvise you to keep this paper a profound secret; it is a work of the\r\nutmost importance and already well known to me.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, des Lupeaulx dismissed Dutocq by one of those glances that\r\nare more expressive than words.\r\n\r\n“Ha! that scoundrel of a Rabourdin has put his finger in this!” thought\r\nDutocq, alarmed on finding himself anticipated; “he has reached the ear\r\nof the administration, while I am left out in the cold. I shouldn’t have\r\nthought it!”\r\n\r\nTo all his other motives of aversion to Rabourdin he now added the\r\njealousy of one man to another man of the same calling,--a most powerful\r\ningredient in hatred.\r\n\r\nWhen des Lupeaulx was left alone, he dropped into a strange meditation.\r\nWhat power was it of which Rabourdin was the instrument? Should he, des\r\nLupeaulx, use this singular document to destroy him, or should he keep\r\nit as a weapon to succeed with the wife? The mystery that lay behind\r\nthis paper was all darkness to des Lupeaulx, who read with something\r\nakin to terror page after page, in which the men of his acquaintance\r\nwere judged with unerring wisdom. He admired Rabourdin, though stabbed\r\nto his vitals by what he said of him. The breakfast-hour suddenly cut\r\nshort his meditation.\r\n\r\n“His Excellency is waiting for you to come down,” announced the\r\nminister’s footman.\r\n\r\nThe minister always breakfasted with his wife and children and des\r\nLupeaulx, without the presence of servants. The morning meal affords the\r\nonly moment of privacy which public men can snatch from the current of\r\noverwhelming business. Yet in spite of the precautions they take to keep\r\nthis hour for private intimacies and affections, a good many great and\r\nlittle people manage to infringe upon it. Business itself will, as at\r\nthis moment, thrust itself in the way of their scanty comfort.\r\n\r\n“I thought Rabourdin was a man above all ordinary petty manoeuvres,”\r\n began the minister; “and yet here, not ten minutes after La\r\nBillardiere’s death, he sends me this note by La Briere,--it is like a\r\nstage missive. Look,” said his Excellency, giving des Lupeaulx a paper\r\nwhich he was twirling in his fingers.\r\n\r\nToo noble in mind to think for a moment of the shameful meaning\r\nLa Billardiere’s death might lend to his letter, Rabourdin had not\r\nwithdrawn it from La Briere’s hands after the news reached him. Des\r\nLupeaulx read as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “Monseigneur,--If twenty-three years of irreproachable services\r\n  may claim a favor, I entreat your Excellency to grant me an\r\n  audience this very day. My honor is involved in the matter of\r\n  which I desire to speak.”\r\n\r\n“Poor man!” said des Lupeaulx, in a tone of compassion which confirmed\r\nthe minister in his error. “We are alone; I advise you to see him now.\r\nYou have a meeting of the Council when the Chamber rises; moreover, your\r\nExcellency has to reply to-day to the opposition; this is really the\r\nonly hour when you can receive him.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx rose, called the servant, said a few words, and returned to\r\nhis seat. “I have told them to bring him in at dessert,” he said.\r\n\r\nLike all other ministers under the Restoration, this particular minister\r\nwas a man without youth. The charter granted by Louis XVIII. had the\r\ndefect of tying the hands of the kings by compelling them to deliver the\r\ndestinies of the nation into the control of the middle-aged men of the\r\nChamber and the septuagenarians of the peerage; it robbed them of the\r\nright to lay hands on a man of statesmanlike talent wherever they\r\ncould find him, no matter how young he was or how poverty-stricken his\r\ncondition might be. Napoleon alone was able to employ young men as\r\nhe chose, without being restrained by any consideration. After the\r\noverthrow of that mighty will, vigor deserted power. Now the period\r\nwhen effeminacy succeeds to vigor presents a contrast that is far\r\nmore dangerous in France than in other countries. As a general thing,\r\nministers who were old before they entered office have proved second\r\nor third rate, while those who were taken young have been an honor\r\nto European monarchies and to the republics whose affairs they have\r\ndirected. The world still rings with the struggle between Pitt and\r\nNapoleon, two men who conducted the politics of their respective\r\ncountries at an age when Henri de Navarre, Richelieu, Mazarin, Colbert,\r\nLouvois, the Prince of Orange, the Guises, Machiavelli, in short, all\r\nthe best known of our great men, coming from the ranks or born to\r\na throne, began to rule the State. The Convention--that model of\r\nenergy--was made up in a great measure of young heads; no sovereign\r\ncan ever forget that it was able to put fourteen armies into the field\r\nagainst Europe. Its policy, fatal in the eyes of those who cling to\r\nwhat is called absolute power, was nevertheless dictated by strictly\r\nmonarchical principles, and it behaved itself like any of the great\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nAfter ten or a dozen years of parliamentary struggle, having studied\r\nthe science of politics until he was worn down by it, this particular\r\nminister had come to be enthroned by his party, who considered him in\r\nthe light of their business man. Happily for him he was now nearer sixty\r\nthan fifty years of age; had he retained even a vestige of juvenile\r\nvigor he would quickly have quenched it. But, accustomed to back and\r\nfill, retreat and return to the charge, he was able to endure being\r\nstruck at, turn and turn about, by his own party, by the opposition,\r\nby the court, by the clergy, because to all such attacks he opposed the\r\ninert force of a substance which was equally soft and consistent; thus\r\nhe reaped the benefits of what was really his misfortune. Harassed by a\r\nthousand questions of government, his mind, like that of an old lawyer\r\nwho has tried every species of case, no longer possessed the spring\r\nwhich solitary minds are able to retain, nor that power of prompt\r\ndecision which distinguishes men who are early accustomed to action, and\r\nyoung soldiers. How could it be otherwise? He had practised sophistries\r\nand quibbled instead of judging; he had criticised effects and done\r\nnothing for causes; his head was full of plans such as a political\r\nparty lays upon the shoulders of a leader,--matters of private interest\r\nbrought to an orator supposed to have a future, a jumble of schemes and\r\nimpractical requests. Far from coming fresh to his work, he was wearied\r\nout with marching and counter-marching, and when he finally reached\r\nthe much desired height of his present position, he found himself in\r\na thicket of thorny bushes with a thousand conflicting wills to\r\nconciliate. If the statesmen of the Restoration had been allowed to\r\nfollow out their own ideas, their capacity would doubtless have been\r\ncriticised; but though their wills were often forced, their age saved\r\nthem from attempting the resistance which youth opposes to intrigues,\r\nboth high and low,--intrigues which vanquished Richelieu, and to which,\r\nin a lower sphere, Rabourdin was to succumb.\r\n\r\nAfter the rough and tumble of their first struggles in political life\r\nthese men, less old than aged, have to endure the additional wear and\r\ntear of a ministry. Thus it is that their eyes begin to weaken just as\r\nthey need to have the clear-sightedness of eagles; their mind is weary\r\nwhen its youth and fire need to be redoubled. The minister in whom\r\nRabourdin sought to confide was in the habit of listening to men\r\nof undoubted superiority as they explained ingenious theories of\r\ngovernment, applicable or inapplicable to the affairs of France. Such\r\nmen, by whom the difficulties of national policy were never apprehended,\r\nwere in the habit of attacking this minister personally whenever a\r\nparliamentary battle or a contest with the secret follies of the court\r\ntook place,--on the eve of a struggle with the popular mind, or on the\r\nmorrow of a diplomatic discussion which divided the Council into three\r\nseparate parties. Caught in such a predicament, a statesman naturally\r\nkeeps a yawn ready for the first sentence designed to show him how the\r\npublic service could be better managed. At such periods not a dinner\r\ntook place among bold schemers or financial and political lobbyists\r\nwhere the opinions of the Bourse and the Bank, the secrets of diplomacy,\r\nand the policy necessitated by the state of affairs in Europe were not\r\ncanvassed and discussed. The minister has his own private councillors in\r\ndes Lupeaulx and his secretary, who collected and pondered all opinions\r\nand discussions for the purpose of analyzing and controlling the various\r\ninterests proclaimed and supported by so many clever men. In fact, his\r\nmisfortune was that of most other ministers who have passed the prime\r\nof life; he trimmed and shuffled under all his difficulties,--with\r\njournalism, which at this period it was thought advisable to repress\r\nin an underhand way rather than fight openly; with financial as well as\r\nlabor questions; with the clergy as well as with that other question\r\nof the public lands; with liberalism as with the Chamber. After\r\nmanoeuvering his way to power in the course of seven years, the minister\r\nbelieved that he could manage all questions of administration in the\r\nsame way. It is so natural to think we can maintain a position by the\r\nsame methods which served us to reach it that no one ventured to blame\r\na system invented by mediocrity to please minds of its own calibre. The\r\nRestoration, like the Polish revolution, proved to nations as to princes\r\nthe true value of a Man, and what will happen if that necessary man is\r\nwanting. The last and the greatest weakness of the public men of the\r\nRestoration was their honesty, in a struggle in which their adversaries\r\nemployed the resources of political dishonesty, lies, and calumnies,\r\nand let loose upon them, by all subversive means, the clamor of the\r\nunintelligent masses, able only to understand revolt.\r\n\r\nRabourdin told himself all these things. But he had made up his mind\r\nto win or lose, like a man weary of gambling who allows himself a last\r\nstake; ill-luck had given him as adversary in the game a sharper like\r\ndes Lupeaulx. With all his sagacity, Rabourdin was better versed in\r\nmatters of administration than in parliamentary optics, and he was far\r\nindeed from imagining how his confidence would be received; he little\r\nthought that the great work that filled his mind would seem to the\r\nminister nothing more than a theory, and that a man who held the\r\nposition of a statesman would confound his reform with the schemes of\r\npolitical and self-interested talkers.\r\n\r\nAs the minister rose from table, thinking of Francois Keller, his wife\r\ndetained him with the offer of a bunch of grapes, and at that moment\r\nRabourdin was announced. Des Lupeaulx had counted on the minister’s\r\npreoccupation and his desire to get away; seeing him for the moment\r\noccupied with his wife, the general-secretary went forward to meet\r\nRabourdin; whom he petrified with his first words, said in a low tone of\r\nvoice:--\r\n\r\n“His Excellency and I know what the subject is that occupies your mind;\r\nyou have nothing to fear”; then, raising his voice, he added, “neither\r\nfrom Dutocq nor from any one else.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t feel uneasy, Rabourdin,” said his Excellency, kindly, but making\r\na movement to get away.\r\n\r\nRabourdin came forward respectfully, and the minister could not evade\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Will your Excellency permit me to see you for a moment in private?” he\r\nsaid, with a mysterious glance.\r\n\r\nThe minister looked at the clock and went towards the window, whither\r\nthe poor man followed him.\r\n\r\n“When may I have the honor of submitting the matter of which I spoke to\r\nyour Excellency? I desire to fully explain the plan of administration to\r\nwhich the paper that was taken belongs--”\r\n\r\n“Plan of administration!” exclaimed the minister, frowning, and\r\nhurriedly interrupting him. “If you have anything of that kind to\r\ncommunicate you must wait for the regular day when we do business\r\ntogether. I ought to be at the Council now; and I have an answer to\r\nmake to the Chamber on that point which the opposition raised before the\r\nsession ended yesterday. Your day is Wednesday next; I could not work\r\nyesterday, for I had other things to attend to; political matters are\r\napt to interfere with purely administrative ones.”\r\n\r\n“I place my honor with all confidence in your Excellency’s hands,” said\r\nRabourdin gravely, “and I entreat you to remember that you have not\r\nallowed me time to give you an immediate explanation of the stolen\r\npaper--”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy,” said des Lupeaulx, interposing between the minister\r\nand Rabourdin, whom he thus interrupted; “in another week you will\r\nprobably be appointed--”\r\n\r\nThe minister smiled as he thought of des Lupeaulx’s enthusiasm for\r\nMadame Rabourdin, and he glanced knowingly at his wife. Rabourdin saw\r\nthe look, and tried to imagine its meaning; his attention was diverted\r\nfor a moment, and his Excellency took advantage of the fact to make his\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n“We will talk of all this, you and I,” said des Lupeaulx, with whom\r\nRabourdin, much to his surprise, now found himself alone. “Don’t be\r\nangry with Dutocq; I’ll answer for his discretion.”\r\n\r\n“Madame Rabourdin is charming,” said the minister’s wife, wishing to say\r\nthe civil thing to the head of a bureau.\r\n\r\nThe children all gazed at Rabourdin with curiosity. The poor man had\r\ncome there expecting some serious, even solemn, result, and he was like\r\na great fish caught in the threads of a flimsy net; he struggled with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Madame la comtesse is very good,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Shall I not have the pleasure of seeing Madame here some Wednesday?”\r\n said the countess. “Pray bring her; it will give me pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“Madame Rabourdin herself receives on Wednesdays,” interrupted des\r\nLupeaulx, who knew the empty civility of an invitation to the official\r\nWednesdays; “but since you are so kind as to wish for her, you will soon\r\ngive one of your private parties, and--”\r\n\r\nThe countess rose with some irritation.\r\n\r\n“You are the master of my ceremonies,” she said to des\r\nLupeaulx,--ambiguous words, by which she expressed the annoyance she\r\nfelt with the secretary for presuming to interfere with her private\r\nparties, to which she admitted only a select few. She left the room\r\nwithout bowing to Rabourdin, who remained alone with des Lupeaulx;\r\nthe latter was twisting in his fingers the confidential letter to\r\nthe minister which Rabourdin had intrusted to La Briere. Rabourdin\r\nrecognized it.\r\n\r\n“You have never really known me,” said des Lupeaulx. “Friday evening\r\nwe will come to a full understanding. Just now I must go and receive\r\ncallers; his Excellency saddles me with that burden when he has other\r\nmatters to attend to. But I repeat, Rabourdin, don’t worry yourself; you\r\nhave nothing to fear.”\r\n\r\nRabourdin walked slowly through the corridors, amazed and confounded by\r\nthis singular turn of events. He had expected Dutocq to denounce him,\r\nand found he had not been mistaken; des Lupeaulx had certainly seen the\r\ndocument which judged him so severely, and yet des Lupeaulx was fawning\r\non his judge! It was all incomprehensible. Men of upright minds are\r\noften at a loss to understand complicated intrigues, and Rabourdin was\r\nlost in a maze of conjecture without being able to discover the object\r\nof the game which the secretary was playing.\r\n\r\n“Either he has not read the part about himself, or he loves my wife.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the two thoughts to which his mind arrived as he crossed the\r\ncourtyard; for the glance he had intercepted the night before between\r\ndes Lupeaulx and Celestine came back to his memory like a flash of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. THE WORMS AT WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nRabourdin’s bureau was during his absence a prey to the keenest\r\nexcitement; for the relation between the head officials and the clerks\r\nin a government office is so regulated that, when a minister’s messenger\r\nsummons the head of a bureau to his Excellency’s presence (above all at\r\nthe latter’s breakfast hour), there is no end to the comments that are\r\nmade. The fact that the present unusual summons followed so closely\r\non the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere seemed to give special\r\nimportance to the circumstance, which was made known to Monsieur\r\nSaillard, who came at once to confer with Baudoyer. Bixiou, who happened\r\nat the moment to be at work with the latter, left him to converse with\r\nhis father-in-law and betook himself to the bureau Rabourdin, where the\r\nusual routine was of course interrupted.\r\n\r\nBixiou [entering]. “I thought I should find you at a white heat! Don’t\r\nyou know what’s going on down below? The virtuous woman is done for!\r\nyes, done for, crushed! Terrible scene at the ministry!”\r\n\r\nDutocq [looking fixedly at him]. “Are you telling the truth?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Pray, who would regret it? Not you, certainly, for you will be\r\nmade under-head-clerk and du Bruel head of the bureau. Monsieur Baudoyer\r\ngets the division.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “I’ll bet a hundred francs that Baudoyer will never be head of\r\nthe division.”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “I’ll join in the bet; will you, Monsieur Poiret?”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I retire in January.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Is it possible? are we to lose the sight of those shoe-ties?\r\nWhat will the ministry be without you? Will nobody take up the bet on my\r\nside?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “I can’t, for I know the facts. Monsieur Rabourdin is appointed.\r\nMonsieur de la Billardiere requested it of the two ministers on his\r\ndeath-bed, blaming himself for having taken the emoluments of an office\r\nof which Rabourdin did all the work; he felt remorse of conscience, and\r\nthe ministers, to quiet him, promised to appoint Rabourdin unless higher\r\npowers intervened.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Gentlemen, are you all against me? seven to one,--for I know\r\nwhich side you’ll take, Monsieur Phellion. Well, I’ll bet a dinner\r\ncosting five hundred francs at the Rocher de Cancale that Rabourdin does\r\nnot get La Billardiere’s place. That will cost you only a hundred francs\r\neach, and I’m risking five hundred,--five to one against me! Do you take\r\nit up?” [Shouting into the next room.] “Du Bruel, what say you?”\r\n\r\nPhellion [laying down his pen]. “Monsieur, may I ask on what you base\r\nthat contingent proposal?--for contingent it is. But stay, I am wrong\r\nto call it a proposal; I should say contract. A wager constitutes a\r\ncontract.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “No, no; you can only apply the word ‘contract’ to agreements\r\nthat are recognized in the Code. Now the Code allows of no action for\r\nthe recovery of a bet.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Proscribe a thing and you recognize it.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Good! my little man.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Dear me!”\r\n\r\nFleury. “True! when one refuses to pay one’s debts, that’s recognizing\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “You would make famous lawyers.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I am as curious as Monsieur Phellion to know what grounds\r\nMonsieur Bixiou has for--”\r\n\r\nBixiou [shouting across the office]. “Du Bruel! Will you bet?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [appearing at the door]. “Heavens and earth, gentlemen, I’m\r\nvery busy; I have something very difficult to do; I’ve got to write an\r\nobituary notice of Monsieur de la Billardiere. I do beg you to be quiet;\r\nyou can laugh and bet afterwards.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “That’s true, du Bruel; the praise of an honest man is a very\r\ndifficult thing to write. I’d rather any day draw a caricature of him.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Do come and help me, Bixiou.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [following him]. “I’m willing; though I can do such things much\r\nbetter when eating.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Well, we will go and dine together afterwards. But listen,\r\nthis is what I have written” [reads] “‘The Church and the Monarchy are\r\ndaily losing many of those who fought for them in Revolutionary times.’”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Bad, very bad; why don’t you say, ‘Death carries on its ravages\r\namongst the few surviving defenders of the monarchy and the old and\r\nfaithful servants of the King, whose heart bleeds under these reiterated\r\nblows?’” [Du Bruel writes rapidly.] “‘Monsieur le Baron Flamet de la\r\nBillardiere died this morning of dropsy, caused by heart disease.’ You\r\nsee, it is just as well to show there are hearts in government offices;\r\nand you ought to slip in a little flummery about the emotions of the\r\nRoyalists during the Terror,--might be useful, hey! But stay,--no!\r\nthe petty papers would be sure to say the emotions came more from the\r\nstomach than the heart. Better leave that out. What are you writing\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [reading]. “‘Issuing from an old parliamentary stock in which\r\ndevotion to the throne was hereditary, as was also attachment to the\r\nfaith of our fathers, Monsieur de la Billardiere--’”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Better say Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “But he wasn’t baron in 1793.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “No matter. Don’t you remember that under the Empire Fouche\r\nwas telling an anecdote about the Convention, in which he had to quote\r\nRobespierre, and he said, ‘Robespierre called out to me, “Duc d’Otrante,\r\ngo to the Hotel de Ville.”’ There’s a precedent for you!”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Let me just write that down; I can use it in a\r\nvaudeville.--But to go back to what we were saying. I don’t want to put\r\n‘Monsieur le baron,’ because I am reserving his honors till the last,\r\nwhen they rained upon him.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Oh! very good; that’s theatrical,--the finale of the article.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [continuing]. “‘In appointing Monsieur de la Billardiere\r\ngentleman-in-ordinary--’”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Very ordinary!”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “‘--of the Bedchamber, the King rewarded not only the services\r\nrendered by the Provost, who knew how to harmonize the severity of his\r\nfunctions with the customary urbanity of the Bourbons, but the bravery\r\nof the Vendean hero, who never bent the knee to the imperial idol. He\r\nleaves a son, who inherits his loyalty and his talents.’”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Don’t you think all that is a little too florid? I should tone\r\ndown the poetry. ‘Imperial idol!’ ‘bent the knee!’ damn it, my dear\r\nfellow, writing vaudevilles has ruined your style; you can’t come down\r\nto pedestrial prose. I should say, ‘He belonged to the small number of\r\nthose who.’ Simplify, simplify! the man himself was a simpleton.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “That’s vaudeville, if you like! You would make your fortune\r\nat the theatre, Bixiou.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “What have you said about Quiberon?” [Reads over du Bruel’s\r\nshoulder.] “Oh, that won’t do! Here, this is what you must say: ‘He took\r\nupon himself, in a book recently published, the responsibility for all\r\nthe blunders of the expedition to Quiberon,--thus proving the nature of\r\nhis loyalty, which did not shrink from any sacrifice.’ That’s clever and\r\nwitty, and exalts La Billardiere.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “At whose expense?”\r\n\r\nBixiou [solemn as a priest in a pulpit]. “Why, Hoche and Tallien, of\r\ncourse; don’t you read history?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “No. I subscribed to the Baudouin series, but I’ve never had\r\ntime to open a volume; one can’t find matter for vaudevilles there.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [at the door]. “We all want to know, Monsieur Bixiou, what made\r\nyou think that the worthy and honorable Monsieur Rabourdin, who has so\r\nlong done the work of this division for Monsieur de la Billardiere,--he,\r\nwho is the senior head of all the bureaus, and whom, moreover, the\r\nminister summoned as soon as he heard of the departure of the late\r\nMonsieur de la Billardiere,--will not be appointed head of the\r\ndivision.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Papa Phellion, you know geography?”\r\n\r\nPhellion [bridling up]. “I should say so!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “And history?”\r\n\r\nPhellion [affecting modesty]. “Possibly.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [looking fixedly at him]. “Your diamond pin is loose, it is\r\ncoming out. Well, you may know all that, but you don’t know the human\r\nheart; you have gone no further in the geography and history of that\r\norgan than you have in the environs of the city of Paris.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [to Vimeux]. “Environs of Paris? I thought they were talking of\r\nMonsieur Rabourdin.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “About that bet? Does the entire bureau Rabourdin bet against\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nAll. “Yes.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Du Bruel, do you count in?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Of course I do. We want Rabourdin to go up a step and make\r\nroom for others.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Well, I accept the bet,--for this reason; you can hardly\r\nunderstand it, but I’ll tell it to you all the same. It would be right\r\nand just to appoint Monsieur Rabourdin” [looking full at Dutocq],\r\n“because, in that case, long and faithful service, honor, and talent\r\nwould be recognized, appreciated, and properly rewarded. Such an\r\nappointment is in the best interests of the administration.” [Phellion,\r\nPoiret, and Thuillier listen stupidly, with the look of those who try\r\nto peer before them in the darkness.] “Well, it is just because the\r\npromotion would be so fitting, and because the man has such merit,\r\nand because the measure is so eminently wise and equitable that I bet\r\nRabourdin will not be appointed. Yes, you’ll see, that appointment will\r\nslip up, just like the invasion from Boulogne, and the march to Russia,\r\nfor the success of which a great genius has gathered together all the\r\nchances. It will fail as all good and just things do fail in this low\r\nworld. I am only backing the devil’s game.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Who do you think will be appointed?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “The more I think about Baudoyer, the more sure I feel that he\r\nunites all the opposite qualities; therefore I think he will be the next\r\nhead of this division.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “But Monsieur des Lupeaulx, who sent for me to borrow my\r\nCharlet, told me positively that Monsieur Rabourdin was appointed, and\r\nthat the little La Billardiere would be made Clerk of the Seals.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Appointed, indeed! The appointment can’t be made and signed\r\nunder ten days. It will certainly not be known before New-Year’s day.\r\nThere he goes now across the courtyard; look at him, and say if the\r\nvirtuous Rabourdin looks like a man in the sunshine of favor. I should\r\nsay he knows he’s dismissed.” [Fleury rushes to the window.] “Gentlemen,\r\nadieu; I’ll go and tell Monsieur Baudoyer that I hear from you that\r\nRabourdin is appointed; it will make him furious, the pious creature!\r\nThen I’ll tell him of our wager, to cool him down,--a process we call at\r\nthe theatre turning the Wheel of Fortune, don’t we, du Bruel? Why do I\r\ncare who gets the place? simply because if Baudoyer does he will make me\r\nunder-head-clerk” [goes out].\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Everybody says that man is clever, but as for me, I can never\r\nunderstand a word he says” [goes on copying]. “I listen and listen; I\r\nhear words, but I never get at any meaning; he talks about the environs\r\nof Paris when he discusses the human heart and” [lays down his pen and\r\ngoes to the stove] “declares he backs the devil’s game when it is a\r\nquestion of Russia and Boulogne; now what is there so clever in that,\r\nI’d like to know? We must first admit that the devil plays any game at\r\nall, and then find out what game; possibly dominoes” [blows his nose].\r\n\r\nFleury [interrupting]. “Pere Poiret is blowing his nose; it must be\r\neleven o’clock.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “So it is! Goodness! I’m off to the secretary; he wants to\r\nread the obituary.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “What was I saying?”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “Dominoes,--perhaps the devil plays dominoes.” [Sebastien\r\nenters to gather up the different papers and circulars for signature.]\r\n\r\nVimeux. “Ah! there you are, my fine young man. Your days of hardship are\r\nnearly over; you’ll get a post. Monsieur Rabourdin will be appointed.\r\nWeren’t you at Madame Rabourdin’s last night? Lucky fellow! they say\r\nthat really superb women go there.”\r\n\r\nSebastien. “Do they? I didn’t know.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Are you blind?”\r\n\r\nSebastien. “I don’t like to look at what I ought not to see.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [delighted]. “Well said, young man!”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “The devil! well, you looked at Madame Rabourdin enough, any\r\nhow; a charming woman.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Pooh! thin as a rail. I saw her in the Tuileries, and I much\r\nprefer Percilliee, the ballet-mistress, Castaing’s victim.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “What has an actress to do with the wife of a government\r\nofficial?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “They both play comedy.”\r\n\r\nFleury [looking askance at Dutocq]. “The physical has nothing to do with\r\nthe moral, and if you mean--”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “I mean nothing.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Do you all want to know which of us will really be made head of\r\nthis bureau?”\r\n\r\nAll. “Yes, tell us.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Colleville.”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “Why?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Because Madame Colleville has taken the shortest way to\r\nit--through the sacristy.”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “I am too much Colleville’s friend not to beg you, Monsieur\r\nFleury, to speak respectfully of his wife.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “A defenceless woman should never be made the subject of\r\nconversation here--”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “All the more because the charming Madame Colleville won’t\r\ninvite Fleury to her house. He backbites her in revenge.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “She may not receive me on the same footing that she does\r\nThuillier, but I go there--”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “When? how?--under her windows?”\r\n\r\nThough Fleury was dreaded as a bully in all the offices, he received\r\nThuillier’s speech in silence. This meekness, which surprised the other\r\nclerks, was owing to a certain note for two hundred francs, of doubtful\r\nvalue, which Thuillier agreed to pass over to his sister. After this\r\nskirmish dead silence prevailed. They all wrote steadily from one to\r\nthree o’clock. Du Bruel did not return.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past three the usual preparations for departure, the brushing\r\nof hats, the changing of coats, went on in all the ministerial offices.\r\nThat precious thirty minutes thus employed served to shorten by just so\r\nmuch the day’s labor. At this hour the over-heated rooms cool off;\r\nthe peculiar odor that hangs about the bureaus evaporates; silence\r\nis restored. By four o’clock none but a few clerks who do their duty\r\nconscientiously remain. A minister may know who are the real workers\r\nunder him if he will take the trouble to walk through the divisions\r\nafter four o’clock,--a species of prying, however, that no one of his\r\ndignity would condescend to.\r\n\r\nThe various heads of divisions and bureaus usually encountered each\r\nother in the courtyards at this hour and exchanged opinions on the\r\nevents of the day. On this occasion they departed by twos and threes,\r\nmost of them agreeing in favor of Rabourdin; while the old stagers,\r\nlike Monsieur Clergeot, shook their heads and said, “Habent sua sidera\r\nlites.” Saillard and Baudoyer were politely avoided, for nobody knew\r\nwhat to say to them about La Billardiere’s death, it being fully\r\nunderstood that Baudoyer wanted the place, though it was certainly not\r\ndue to him.\r\n\r\nWhen Saillard and his son-in-law had gone a certain distance from the\r\nministry the former broke silence and said: “Things look badly for you,\r\nmy poor Baudoyer.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t understand,” replied the other, “what Elisabeth was dreaming\r\nof when she sent Godard in such a hurry to get a passport for Falleix;\r\nGodard tells me she hired a post-chaise by the advice of my uncle\r\nMitral, and that Falleix has already started for his own part of the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\n“Some matter connected with our business,” suggested Saillard.\r\n\r\n“Our most pressing business just now is to look after Monsieur La\r\nBillardiere’s place,” returned Baudoyer, crossly.\r\n\r\nThey were just then near the entrance of the Palais-Royal on the rue\r\nSaint-Honore. Dutocq came up, bowing, and joined them.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he said to Baudoyer, “if I can be useful to you in any way\r\nunder the circumstances in which you find yourself, pray command me, for\r\nI am not less devoted to your interests than Monsieur Godard.”\r\n\r\n“Such an assurance is at least consoling,” replied Baudoyer; “it makes\r\nme aware that I have the confidence of honest men.”\r\n\r\n“If you would kindly employ your influence to get me placed in\r\nyour division, taking Bixiou as head of the bureau and me as\r\nunder-head-clerk, you will secure the future of two men who are ready to\r\ndo anything for your advancement.”\r\n\r\n“Are you making fun of us, monsieur?” asked Saillard, staring at him\r\nstupidly.\r\n\r\n“Far be it from me to do that,” said Dutocq. “I have just come from the\r\nprinting-office of the ministerial journal (where I carried from the\r\ngeneral-secretary an obituary notice of Monsieur de la Billardiere), and\r\nI there read an article which will appear to-night about you, which has\r\ngiven me the highest opinion of your character and talents. If it is\r\nnecessary to crush Rabourdin, I’m in a position to give him the final\r\nblow; please to remember that.”\r\n\r\nDutocq disappeared.\r\n\r\n“May I be shot if I understand a single word of it,” said Saillard,\r\nlooking at Baudoyer, whose little eyes were expressive of stupid\r\nbewilderment. “I must buy the newspaper to-night.”\r\n\r\nWhen the two reached home and entered the salon on the ground-floor,\r\nthey found a large fire lighted, and Madame Saillard, Elisabeth,\r\nMonsieur Gaudron and the curate of Saint-Paul’s sitting by it. The\r\ncurate turned at once to Monsieur Baudoyer, to whom Elisabeth made a\r\nsign which he failed to understand.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the curate, “I have lost no time in coming in person to\r\nthank you for the magnificent gift with which you have adorned my poor\r\nchurch. I dared not run in debt to buy that beautiful monstrance,\r\nworthy of a cathedral. You, who are one of our most pious and faithful\r\nparishioners, must have keenly felt the bareness of the high altar. I am\r\non my way to see Monseigneur the coadjutor, and he will, I am sure, send\r\nyou his own thanks later.”\r\n\r\n“I have done nothing as yet--” began Baudoyer.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le cure,” interposed his wife, cutting him short. “I see I am\r\nforced to betray the whole secret. Monsieur Baudoyer hopes to complete\r\nthe gift by sending you a dais for the coming Fete-Dieu. But the\r\npurchase must depend on the state of our finances, and our finances\r\ndepend on my husband’s promotion.”\r\n\r\n“God will reward those who honor him,” said Monsieur Gaudron, preparing,\r\nwith the curate, to take leave.\r\n\r\n“But will you not,” said Saillard to the two ecclesiastics, “do us the\r\nhonor to take pot luck with us?”\r\n\r\n“You can stay, my dear vicar,” said the curate to Gaudron; “you know I\r\nam engaged to dine with the curate of Saint-Roch, who, by the bye, is to\r\nbury Monsieur de la Billardiere to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le cure de Saint-Roch might say a word for us,” began\r\nBaudoyer. His wife pulled the skirt of his coat violently.\r\n\r\n“Do hold your tongue, Baudoyer,” she said, leading him aside and\r\nwhispering in his ear. “You have given a monstrance to the church, that\r\ncost five thousand francs. I’ll explain it all later.”\r\n\r\nThe miserly Baudoyer make a sulky grimace, and continued gloomy and\r\ncross for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\n“What did you busy yourself about Falleix’s passport for? Why do you\r\nmeddle in other people’s affairs?” he presently asked her.\r\n\r\n“I must say, I think Falleix’s affairs are as much ours as his,”\r\n returned Elisabeth, dryly, glancing at her husband to make him notice\r\nMonsieur Gaudron, before whom he ought to be silent.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, certainly,” said old Saillard, thinking of his\r\nco-partnership.\r\n\r\n“I hope you reached the newspaper office in time?” remarked Elisabeth to\r\nMonsieur Gaudron, as she helped him to soup.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear lady,” answered the vicar; “when the editor read the\r\nlittle article I gave him, written by the secretary of the Grand\r\nAlmoner, he made no difficulty. He took pains to insert it in a\r\nconspicuous place. I should never have thought of that; but this young\r\njournalist has a wide-awake mind. The defenders of religion can enter\r\nthe lists against impiety without disadvantage at the present moment,\r\nfor there is a great deal of talent in the royalist press. I have every\r\nreason to believe that success will crown your hopes. But you must\r\nremember, my dear Baudoyer, to promote Monsieur Colleville; he is an\r\nobject of great interest to his Eminence; in fact, I am desired to\r\nmention him to you.”\r\n\r\n“If I am head of the division, I will make him head of one of my\r\nbureaus, if you want me to,” said Baudoyer.\r\n\r\nThe matter thus referred to was explained after dinner, when the\r\nministerial organ (bought and sent up by the porter) proved to contain\r\namong its Paris news the following articles, called items:--\r\n\r\n  “Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere died this morning, after a\r\n  long and painful illness. The king loses a devoted servant, the\r\n  Church a most pious son. Monsieur de la Billardiere’s end has\r\n  fitly crowned a noble life, consecrated in dark and troublesome\r\n  times to perilous missions, and of late years to arduous civic\r\n  duties. Monsieur de la Billardiere was provost of a department,\r\n  where his force of character triumphed over all the obstacles that\r\n  rebellion arrayed against him. He subsequently accepted the\r\n  difficult post of director of a division (in which his great\r\n  acquirements were not less useful than the truly French affability\r\n  of his manners) for the express purpose of conciliating the\r\n  serious interests that arise under its administration. No rewards\r\n  have ever been more truly deserved than those by which the King,\r\n  Louis XVIII., and his present Majesty took pleasure in crowning a\r\n  loyalty which never faltered under the usurper. This old family\r\n  still survives in the person of a single heir to the excellent man\r\n  whose death now afflicts so many warm friends. His Majesty has\r\n  already graciously made known that Monsieur Benjamin de la\r\n  Billardiere will be included among the gentlemen-in-ordinary of\r\n  the Bedchamber.\r\n\r\n  “The numerous friends who have not already received their\r\n  notification of this sad event are hereby informed that the\r\n  funeral will take place to-morrow at four o’clock, in the church\r\n  of Saint-Roch. The memorial address will be delivered by Monsieur\r\n  l’Abbe Fontanon.”----\r\n\r\n  “Monsieur Isidore-Charles-Thomas Baudoyer, representing one of the\r\n  oldest bourgeois families of Paris, and head of a bureau in the\r\n  late Monsieur de la Billardiere’s division, has lately recalled\r\n  the old traditions of piety and devotion which formerly\r\n  distinguished these great families, so jealous for the honor and\r\n  glory of religion, and so faithful in preserving its monuments.\r\n  The church of Saint-Paul has long needed a monstrance in keeping\r\n  with the magnificence of that basilica, itself due to the Company\r\n  of Jesus. Neither the vestry nor the curate were rich enough to\r\n  decorate the altar. Monsieur Baudoyer has bestowed upon the parish\r\n  a monstrance that many persons have seen and admired at Monsieur\r\n  Gohier’s, the king’s jeweller. Thanks to the piety of this\r\n  gentleman, who did not shrink from the immensity of the price, the\r\n  church of Saint-Paul possesses to-day a masterpiece of the\r\n  jeweller’s art designed by Monsieur de Sommervieux. It gives us\r\n  pleasure to make known this fact, which proves how powerless the\r\n  declamations of liberals have been on the mind of the Parisian\r\n  bourgeoisie. The upper ranks of that body have at all times been\r\n  royalist and they prove it when occasion offers.”\r\n\r\n“The price was five thousand francs,” said the Abbe Gaudron; “but as the\r\npayment was in cash, the court jeweller reduced the amount.”\r\n\r\n“Representing one of the oldest bourgeois families in Paris!” Saillard\r\nwas saying to himself; “there it is printed,--in the official paper,\r\ntoo!”\r\n\r\n“Dear Monsieur Gaudron,” said Madame Baudoyer, “please help my father to\r\ncompose a little speech that he could slip into the countess’s ear when\r\nhe takes her the monthly stipend,--a single sentence that would cover\r\nall! I must leave you. I am obliged to go out with my uncle Mitral.\r\nWould you believe it? I was unable to find my uncle Bidault at home this\r\nafternoon. Oh, what a dog-kennel he lives in! But Monsieur Mitral, who\r\nknows his ways, says he does all his business between eight o’clock in\r\nthe morning and midday, and that after that hour he can be found only at\r\na certain cafe called the Cafe Themis,--a singular name.”\r\n\r\n“Is justice done there?” said the abbe, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Do you ask why he goes to a cafe at the corner of the rue Dauphine and\r\nthe quai des Augustins? They say he plays dominoes there every night\r\nwith his friend Monsieur Gobseck. I don’t wish to go to such a place\r\nalone; my uncle Mitral will take me there and bring me back.”\r\n\r\nAt this instant Mitral showed his yellow face, surmounted by a wig which\r\nlooked as though it might be made of hay, and made a sign to his niece\r\nto come at once, and not keep a carriage waiting at two francs an hour.\r\nMadame Baudoyer rose and went away without giving any explanation to her\r\nhusband or father.\r\n\r\n“Heaven has given you in that woman,” said Monsieur Gaudron to Baudoyer\r\nwhen Elisabeth had disappeared, “a perfect treasure of prudence\r\nand virtue, a model of wisdom, a Christian who gives sure signs of\r\npossessing the Divine spirit. Religion alone is able to form such\r\nperfect characters. To-morrow I shall say a mass for the success of your\r\ngood cause. It is all-important, for the sake of the monarchy and of\r\nreligion itself that you should receive this appointment. Monsieur\r\nRabourdin is a liberal; he subscribes to the ‘Journal des Debats,’ a\r\ndangerous newspaper, which made war on Monsieur le Comte de Villele to\r\nplease the wounded vanity of Monsieur de Chateaubriand. His Eminence\r\nwill read the newspaper to-night, if only to see what is said of his\r\npoor friend Monsieur de la Billardiere; and Monseigneur the coadjutor\r\nwill speak of you to the King. When I think of what you have now done\r\nfor his dear church, I feel sure he will not forget you in his prayers;\r\nmore than that, he is dining at this moment with the coadjutor at the\r\nhouse of the curate of Saint-Roch.”\r\n\r\nThese words made Saillard and Baudoyer begin to perceive that Elisabeth\r\nhad not been idle ever since Godard had informed her of Monsieur de la\r\nBillardiere’s decease.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t she clever, that Elisabeth of mine?” cried Saillard,\r\ncomprehending more clearly than Monsieur l’abbe the rapid undermining,\r\nlike the path of a mole, which his daughter had undertaken.\r\n\r\n“She sent Godard to Rabourdin’s door to find out what newspaper he\r\ntakes,” said Gaudron; “and I mentioned the name to the secretary of his\r\nEminence,--for we live at a crisis when the Church and Throne must keep\r\nthemselves informed as to who are their friends and who their enemies.”\r\n\r\n“For the last five days I have been trying to find the right thing to\r\nsay to his Excellency’s wife,” said Saillard.\r\n\r\n“All Paris will read that,” cried Baudoyer, whose eyes were still\r\nriveted on the paper.\r\n\r\n“Your eulogy costs us four thousand eight hundred francs, son-in-law!”\r\n exclaimed Madame Saillard.\r\n\r\n“You have adorned the house of God,” said the Abbe Gaudron.\r\n\r\n“We might have got salvation without doing that,” she returned. “But\r\nif Baudoyer gets the place, which is worth eight thousand more, the\r\nsacrifice is not so great. If he doesn’t get it! hey, papa,” she added,\r\nlooking at her husband, “how we shall have bled!--”\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind,” said Saillard, enthusiastically, “we can always make\r\nit up through Falleix, who is going to extend his business and use his\r\nbrother, whom he has made a stockbroker on purpose. Elisabeth might have\r\ntold us, I think, why Falleix went off in such a hurry. But let’s invent\r\nmy little speech. This is what I thought of: ‘Madame, if you would say a\r\nword to his Excellency--’”\r\n\r\n“‘If you would deign,’” said Gaudron; “add the word ‘deign,’ it is\r\nmore respectful. But you ought to know, first of all, whether Madame la\r\nDauphine will grant you her protection, and then you could suggest to\r\nMadame la comtesse the idea of co-operating with the wishes of her Royal\r\nHighness.”\r\n\r\n“You ought to designate the vacant post,” said Baudoyer.\r\n\r\n“‘Madame la comtesse,’” began Saillard, rising, and bowing to his wife,\r\nwith an agreeable smile.\r\n\r\n“Goodness! Saillard; how ridiculous you look. Take care, my man, you’ll\r\nmake the woman laugh.”\r\n\r\n“‘Madame la comtesse,’” resumed Saillard. “Is that better, wife?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my duck.”\r\n\r\n“‘The place of the worthy Monsieur de la Billardiere is vacant; my\r\nson-in-law, Monsieur Baudoyer--’”\r\n\r\n“‘Man of talent and extreme piety,’” prompted Gaudron.\r\n\r\n“Write it down, Baudoyer,” cried old Saillard, “write that sentence\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer proceeded to take a pen and wrote, without a blush, his own\r\npraises, precisely as Nathan or Canalis might have reviewed one of their\r\nown books.\r\n\r\n“‘Madame la comtesse’--Don’t you see, mother?” said Saillard to his\r\nwife; “I am supposing you to be the minister’s wife.”\r\n\r\n“Do you take me for a fool?” she answered sharply. “I know that.”\r\n\r\n“‘The place of the late worthy de la Billardiere is vacant; my\r\nson-in-law, Monsieur Baudoyer, a man of consummate talent and extreme\r\npiety--’” After looking at Monsieur Gaudron, who was reflecting, he\r\nadded, “‘will be very glad if he gets it.’ That’s not bad; it’s brief\r\nand it says the whole thing.”\r\n\r\n“But do wait, Saillard; don’t you see that Monsieur l’abbe is turning it\r\nover in his mind?” said Madame Saillard; “don’t disturb him.”\r\n\r\n“‘Will be very thankful if you would deign to interest yourself in his\r\nbehalf,’” resumed Gaudron. “‘And in saying a word to his Excellency you\r\nwill particularly please Madame la Dauphine, by whom he has the honor\r\nand the happiness to be protected.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Monsieur Gaudron, that sentence is worth more than the monstrance;\r\nI don’t regret the four thousand eight hundred--Besides, Baudoyer, my\r\nlad, you’ll pay them, won’t you? Have you written it all down?”\r\n\r\n“I shall make you repeat it, father, morning and evening,” said Madame\r\nSaillard. “Yes, that’s a good speech. How lucky you are, Monsieur\r\nGaudron, to know so much. That’s what it is to be brought up in a\r\nseminary; they learn there how to speak to God and his saints.”\r\n\r\n“He is as good as he is learned,” said Baudoyer, pressing the priest’s\r\nhand. “Did you write that article?” he added, pointing to the newspaper.\r\n\r\n“No, it was written by the secretary of his Eminence, a young abbe\r\nwho is under obligations to me, and who takes an interest in Monsieur\r\nColleville; he was educated at my expense.”\r\n\r\n“A good deed is always rewarded,” said Baudoyer.\r\n\r\nWhile these four personages were sitting down to their game of boston,\r\nElisabeth and her uncle Mitral reached the cafe Themis, with much\r\ndiscourse as they drove along about a matter which Elisabeth’s keen\r\nperceptions told her was the most powerful lever that could be used to\r\nforce the minister’s hand in the affair of her husband’s appointment.\r\nUncle Mitral, a former sheriff’s officer, crafty, clever at sharp\r\npractice, and full of expedients and judicial precautions, believed the\r\nhonor of his family to be involved in the appointment of his nephew.\r\nHis avarice had long led him to estimate the contents of old Gigonnet’s\r\nstrong-box, for he knew very well they would go in the end to benefit\r\nhis nephew Baudoyer; and it was therefore important that the latter\r\nshould obtain a position which would be in keeping with the combined\r\nfortunes of the Saillards and the old Gigonnet, which would finally\r\ndevolve on the Baudoyer’s little daughter; and what an heiress she would\r\nbe with an income of a hundred thousand francs! to what social position\r\nmight she not aspire with that fortune? He adopted all the ideas of his\r\nniece Elisabeth and thoroughly understood them. He had helped in sending\r\noff Falleix expeditiously, explaining to him the advantage of taking\r\npost horses. After which, while eating his dinner, he reflected that\r\nit be as well to give a twist of his own to the clever plan invented by\r\nElisabeth.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Cafe Themis he told his niece that he alone could\r\nmanage Gigonnet in the matter they both had in view, and he made her\r\nwait in the hackney-coach and bide her time to come forward at the right\r\nmoment. Elisabeth saw through the window-panes the two faces of Gobseck\r\nand Gigonnet (her uncle Bidault), which stood out in relief against\r\nthe yellow wood-work of the old cafe, like two cameo heads, cold and\r\nimpassible, in the rigid attitude that their gravity gave them. The two\r\nParisian misers were surrounded by a number of other old faces, on which\r\n“thirty per cent discount” was written in circular wrinkles that started\r\nfrom the nose and turned round the glacial cheek-bones. These remarkable\r\nphysiognomies brightened up on seeing Mitral, and their eyes gleamed\r\nwith tigerish curiosity.\r\n\r\n“Hey, hey! it is papa Mitral!” cried one of them, named Chaboisseau, a\r\nlittle old man who discounted for a publisher.\r\n\r\n“Bless me, so it is!” said another, a broker named Metivier, “ha, that’s\r\nan old monkey well up in his tricks.”\r\n\r\n“And you,” retorted Mitral, “you are an old crow who knows all about\r\ncarcasses.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the stern Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“What are you here for? Have you come to seize friend Metivier?” asked\r\nGigonnet, pointing to the broker, who had the bluff face of a porter.\r\n\r\n“Your great-niece Elisabeth is out there, papa Gigonnet,” whispered\r\nMitral.\r\n\r\n“What! some misfortune?” said Bidault. The old man drew his eyebrows\r\ntogether and assumed a tender look like that of an executioner when\r\nabout to go to work officially. In spite of his Roman virtue he must\r\nhave been touched, for his red nose lost somewhat of its color.\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose it is misfortune, won’t you help Saillard’s daughter?--a\r\ngirl who has knitted your stockings for the last thirty years!” cried\r\nMitral.\r\n\r\n“If there’s good security I don’t say I won’t,” replied Gigonnet.\r\n“Falleix is in with them. Falleix has just set up his brother as a\r\nbroker, and he is doing as much business as the Brezacs; and what with?\r\nhis mind, perhaps! Saillard is no simpleton.”\r\n\r\n“He knows the value of money,” put in Chaboisseau.\r\n\r\nThat remark, uttered among those old men, would have made an artist and\r\nthinker shudder as they all nodded their heads.\r\n\r\n“But it is none of my business,” resumed Bidault-Gigonnet. “I’m not\r\nbound to care for my neighbors’ misfortunes. My principle is never to be\r\noff my guard with friends or relatives; you can’t perish except through\r\nweakness. Apply to Gobseck; he is softer.”\r\n\r\nThe usurers all applauded these doctrines with a shake of their metallic\r\nheads. An onlooker would have fancied he heard the creaking of ill-oiled\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n“Come, Gigonnet, show a little feeling,” said Chaboisseau, “they’ve knit\r\nyour stockings for thirty years.”\r\n\r\n“That counts for something,” remarked Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Are you all alone? Is it safe to speak?” said Mitral, looking carefully\r\nabout him. “I come about a good piece of business.”\r\n\r\n“If it is good, why do you come to us?” said Gigonnet, sharply,\r\ninterrupting Mitral.\r\n\r\n“A fellow who was a gentleman of the Bedchamber,” went on Mitral, “a\r\nformer ‘chouan,’--what’s his name?--La Billardiere is dead.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“And our nephew is giving monstrances to the church,” snarled Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“He is not such a fool as to give them, he sells them, old man,” said\r\nMitral, proudly. “He wants La Billardiere’s place, and in order to get\r\nit, we must seize--”\r\n\r\n“Seize! You’ll never be anything but a sheriff’s officer,” put in\r\nMetivier, striking Mitral amicably on the shoulder; “I like that, I do!”\r\n\r\n“Seize Monsieur Clement des Lupeaulx in our clutches,” continued Mitral;\r\n“Elisabeth has discovered how to do it, and he is--”\r\n\r\n“Elisabeth”; cried Gigonnet, interrupting again; “dear little creature!\r\nshe takes after her grandfather, my poor brother! he never had his\r\nequal! Ah, you should have seen him buying up old furniture; what tact!\r\nwhat shrewdness! What does Elisabeth want?”\r\n\r\n“Hey! hey!” cried Mitral, “you’ve got back your bowels of compassion,\r\npapa Gigonnet! That phenomenon has a cause.”\r\n\r\n“Always a child,” said Gobseck to Gigonnet, “you are too quick on the\r\ntrigger.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Gobseck and Gigonnet, listen to me; you want to keep well with\r\ndes Lupeaulx, don’t you? You’ve not forgotten how you plucked him in\r\nthat affair about the king’s debts, and you are afraid he’ll ask you to\r\nreturn some of his feathers,” said Mitral.\r\n\r\n“Shall we tell him the whole thing?” asked Gobseck, whispering to\r\nGigonnet.\r\n\r\n“Mitral is one of us; he wouldn’t play a shabby trick on his former\r\ncustomers,” replied Gigonnet. “You see, Mitral,” he went on, speaking to\r\nthe ex-sheriff in a low voice, “we three have just bought up all those\r\ndebts, the payment of which depends on the decision of the liquidation\r\ncommittee.”\r\n\r\n“How much will you lose?” asked Mitral.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows we are in it,” added Gigonnet; “Samanon screens us.”\r\n\r\n“Come, listen to me, Gigonnet; it is cold, and your niece is waiting\r\noutside. You’ll understand what I want in two words. You must at\r\nonce, between you, send two hundred and fifty thousand francs (without\r\ninterest) into the country after Falleix, who has gone post-haste, with\r\na courier in advance of him.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“What for?” cried Gigonnet, “and where to?”\r\n\r\n“To des Lupeaulx’s magnificent country-seat,” replied Mitral. “Falleix\r\nknows the country, for he was born there; and he is going to buy up\r\nland all round the secretary’s miserable hovel, with the two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand francs I speak of,--good land, well worth the price.\r\nThere are only nine days before us for drawing up and recording the\r\nnotarial deeds (bear that in mind). With the addition of this land, des\r\nLupeaulx’s present miserable property would pay taxes to the amount of\r\none thousand francs, the sum necessary to make a man eligible to the\r\nChamber. Ergo, with it des Lupeaulx goes into the electoral college,\r\nbecomes eligible, count, and whatever he pleases. You know the deputy\r\nwho has slipped out and left a vacancy, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe two misers nodded.\r\n\r\n“Des Lupeaulx would cut off a leg to get elected in his place,”\r\n continued Mitral; “but he must have the title-deeds of the property in\r\nhis own name, and then mortgage them back to us for the amount of the\r\npurchase-money. Ah! now you begin to see what I am after! First of all,\r\nwe must make sure of Baudoyer’s appointment, and des Lupeaulx will get\r\nit for us on these terms; after that is settled we will hand him back\r\nto you. Falleix is now canvassing the electoral vote. Don’t you\r\nperceive that you have Lupeaulx completely in your power until after the\r\nelection?--for Falleix’s friends are a large majority. Now do you see\r\nwhat I mean, papa Gigonnet?”\r\n\r\n“It’s a clever game,” said Metivier.\r\n\r\n“We’ll do it,” said Gigonnet; “you agree, don’t you, Gobseck? Falleix\r\ncan give us security and put mortgages on the property in my name; we’ll\r\ngo and see des Lupeaulx when all is ready.”\r\n\r\n“We’re robbed,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha!” laughed Mitral, “I’d like to know the robber!”\r\n\r\n“Nobody can rob us but ourselves,” answered Gigonnet. “I told you we\r\nwere doing a good thing in buying up all des Lupeaulx’s paper from his\r\ncreditors at sixty per cent discount.”\r\n\r\n“Take this mortgage on his estate and you’ll hold him tighter still\r\nthrough the interest,” answered Mitral.\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\nAfter exchanging a shrewd look with Gobseck, Gigonnet went to the door\r\nof the cafe.\r\n\r\n“Elisabeth! follow it up, my dear,” he said to his niece. “We hold your\r\nman securely; but don’t neglect accessories. You have begun well, clever\r\nwoman! go on as you began and you’ll have your uncle’s esteem,” and he\r\ngrasped her hand, gayly.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Mitral, “Metivier and Chaboisseau heard it all, and they\r\nmay play us a trick and tell the matter to some opposition journal\r\nwhich would catch the ball on its way and counteract the effect of the\r\nministerial article. You must go alone, my dear; I dare not let those\r\ntwo cormorants out of my sight.” So saying he re-entered the cafe.\r\n\r\nThe next day the numerous subscribers to a certain liberal journal read,\r\namong the Paris items, the following article, inserted authoritatively\r\nby Chaboisseau and Metivier, share-holders in the said journal, brokers\r\nfor publishers, printers, and paper-makers, whose behests no editor\r\ndared refuse:--\r\n\r\n  “Yesterday a ministerial journal plainly indicated as the probable\r\n  successor of Monsieur le Baron de la Billardiere, Monsieur\r\n  Baudoyer, one of the worthiest citizens of a populous quarter,\r\n  where his benevolence is scarcely less known than the piety on\r\n  which the ministerial organ laid so much stress. Why was that\r\n  sheet silent as to his talents? Did it reflect that in boasting of\r\n  the bourgeoise nobility of Monsieur Baudoyer--which, certainly, is\r\n  a nobility as good as any other--it was pointing out a reason for\r\n  the exclusion of the candidate? A gratuitous piece of perfidy! an\r\n  attempt to kill with a caress! To appoint Monsieur Baudoyer is to\r\n  do honor to the virtues, the talents of the middle classes, of\r\n  whom we shall ever be the supporters, though their cause seems at\r\n  times a lost one. This appointment, we repeat, will be an act of\r\n  justice and good policy; consequently we may be sure it will not\r\n  be made.”\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Friday, the usual day for the dinner given by Madame\r\nRabourdin, whom des Lupeaulx had left at midnight, radiant in beauty, on\r\nthe staircase of the Bouffons, arm in arm with Madame de Camps (Madame\r\nFirmiani had lately married), the old roue awoke with his thoughts\r\nof vengeance calmed, or rather refreshed, and his mind full of a last\r\nglance exchanged with Celestine.\r\n\r\n“I’ll make sure of Rabourdin’s support by forgiving him now,--I’ll get\r\neven with him later. If he hasn’t this place for the time being I should\r\nhave to give up a woman who is capable of becoming a most precious\r\ninstrument in the pursuit of high political fortune. She understands\r\neverything; shrinks from nothing, from no idea whatever!--and besides,\r\nI can’t know before his Excellency what new scheme of administration\r\nRabourdin has invented. No, my dear des Lupeaulx, the thing in hand is\r\nto win all now for your Celestine. You may make as many faces as you\r\nplease, Madame la comtesse, but you will invite Madame Rabourdin to your\r\nnext select party.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx was one of those men who to satisfy a passion are quite\r\nable to put away revenge in some dark corner of their minds. His course\r\nwas taken; he was resolved to get Rabourdin appointed.\r\n\r\n“I will prove to you, my dear fellow, that I deserve a good place in\r\nyour galley,” thought he as he seated himself in his study and began to\r\nunfold a newspaper.\r\n\r\nHe knew so well what the ministerial organ would contain that he rarely\r\ntook the trouble to read it, but on this occasion he did open it to\r\nlook at the article on La Billardiere, recollecting with amusement the\r\ndilemma in which du Bruel had put him by bringing him the night before\r\nBixiou’s amendments to the obituary. He was laughing to himself as he\r\nreread the biography of the late Comte da Fontaine, dead a few months\r\nearlier, which he had hastily substituted for that of La Billardiere,\r\nwhen his eyes were dazzled by the name of Baudoyer. He read with fury\r\nthe article which pledged the minister, and then he rang violently for\r\nDutocq, to send him at once to the editor. But what was his astonishment\r\non reading the reply of the opposition paper! The situation was\r\nevidently serious. He knew the game, and he saw that the man who was\r\nshuffling his cards for him was a Greek of the first order. To dictate\r\nin this way through two opposing newspapers in one evening, and to begin\r\nthe fight by forestalling the intentions of the minister was a daring\r\ngame! He recognized the pen of a liberal editor, and resolved to\r\nquestion him that night at the opera. Dutocq appeared.\r\n\r\n“Read that,” said des Lupeaulx, handing him over the two journals, and\r\ncontinuing to run his eye over others to see if Baudoyer had pulled\r\nany further wires. “Go to the office and ask who has dared to thus\r\ncompromise the minister.”\r\n\r\n“It was not Monsieur Baudoyer himself,” answered Dutocq, “for he never\r\nleft the ministry yesterday. I need not go and inquire; for when I took\r\nyour article to the newspaper office I met a young abbe who brought in a\r\nletter from the Grand Almoner, before which you yourself would have had\r\nto bow.”\r\n\r\n“Dutocq, you have a grudge against Monsieur Rabourdin, and it isn’t\r\nright; for he has twice saved you from being turned out. However, we\r\nare not masters of our own feelings; we sometimes hate our benefactors.\r\nOnly, remember this; if you show the slightest treachery to Rabourdin,\r\nwithout my permission, it will be your ruin. As to that newspaper,\r\nlet the Grand Almoner subscribe as largely as we do, if he wants\r\nits services. Here we are at the end of the year; the matter of\r\nsubscriptions will come up for discussion, and I shall have something to\r\nsay on that head. As to La Billardiere’s place, there is only one way to\r\nsettle the matter; and that is to appoint Rabourdin this very day.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Dutocq, returning to the clerks’ office and addressing\r\nhis colleagues. “I don’t know if Bixiou has the art of looking into\r\nfuturity, but if you have not read the ministerial journal I advise you\r\nto study the article about Baudoyer; then, as Monsieur Fleury takes the\r\nopposition sheet, you can see the reply. Monsieur Rabourdin certainly\r\nhas talent, but a man who in these days gives a six-thousand-franc\r\nmonstrance to the Church has a devilish deal more talent than he.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [entering]. “What say you, gentlemen, to the First Epistle to the\r\nCorinthians in our pious ministerial journal, and the reply Epistle to\r\nthe Ministers in the opposition sheet? How does Monsieur Rabourdin feel\r\nnow, du Bruel?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [rushing in]. “I don’t know.” [He drags Bixiou back into his\r\ncabinet, and says in a low voice] “My good fellow, your way of helping\r\npeople is like that of the hangman who jumps upon a victim’s shoulders\r\nto break his neck. You got me into a scrape with des Lupeaulx, which my\r\nfolly in ever trusting you richly deserved. A fine thing indeed, that\r\narticle on La Billardiere. I sha’n’t forget the trick! Why, the very\r\nfirst sentence was as good as telling the King he was superannuated and\r\nit was time for him to die. And as to that Quiberon bit, it said plainly\r\nthat the King was a--What a fool I was!”\r\n\r\nBixiou [laughing]. “Bless my heart! are you getting angry? Can’t a\r\nfellow joke any more?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Joke! joke indeed. When you want to be made head-clerk\r\nsomebody shall joke with you, my dear fellow.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [in a bullying tone]. “Angry, are we?”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel. “Yes!”\r\n\r\nBixiou [dryly]. “So much the worse for you.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [uneasy]. “You wouldn’t pardon such a thing yourself, I know.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [in a wheedling tone]. “To a friend? indeed I would.” [They hear\r\nFleury’s voice.] “There’s Fleury cursing Baudoyer. Hey, how well\r\nthe thing has been managed! Baudoyer will get the appointment.”\r\n [Confidentially] “After all, so much the better. Du Bruel, just keep\r\nyour eye on the consequences. Rabourdin would be a mean-spirited\r\ncreature to stay under Baudoyer; he will send in his registration, and\r\nthat will give us two places. You can be head of the bureau and take me\r\nfor under-head-clerk. We will make vaudevilles together, and I’ll fag at\r\nyour work in the office.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [smiling]. “Dear me, I never thought of that. Poor Rabourdin! I\r\nshall be sorry for him, though.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “That shows how much you love him!” [Changing his tone] “Ah,\r\nwell, I don’t pity him any longer. He’s rich; his wife gives parties and\r\ndoesn’t ask me,--me, who go everywhere! Well, good-bye, my dear fellow,\r\ngood-bye, and don’t owe me a grudge!” [He goes out through the clerks’\r\noffice.] “Adieu, gentlemen; didn’t I tell you yesterday that a man who\r\nhas nothing but virtues and talents will always be poor, even though he\r\nhas a pretty wife?”\r\n\r\nHenry. “You are so rich, you!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Not bad, my Cincinnatus! But you’ll give me that dinner at the\r\nRocher de Cancale.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “It is absolutely impossible for me to understand Monsieur\r\nBixiou.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [with an elegaic air]. “Monsieur Rabourdin so seldom reads the\r\nnewspapers that it might perhaps be serviceable to deprive ourselves\r\nmomentarily by taking them in to him.” [Fleury hands over his paper,\r\nVimeux the office sheet, and Phellion departs with them.]\r\n\r\nAt that moment des Lupeaulx, coming leisurely downstairs to breakfast\r\nwith the minister, was asking himself whether, before playing a trump\r\ncard for the husband, it might not be prudent to probe the wife’s heart\r\nand make sure of a reward for his devotion. He was feeling about for\r\nthe small amount of heart that he possessed, when, at a turn of the\r\nstaircase, he encountered his lawyer, who said to him, smiling, “Just a\r\nword, Monseigneur,” in the tone of familiarity assumed by men who know\r\nthey are indispensable.\r\n\r\n“What is it, my dear Desroches?” exclaimed the politician. “Has anything\r\nhappened?”\r\n\r\n“I have come to tell you that all your notes and debts have been brought\r\nup by Gobseck and Gigonnet, under the name of a certain Samanon.”\r\n\r\n“Men whom I helped to make their millions!”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” whispered the lawyer. “Gigonnet (really named Bidault) is\r\nthe uncle of Saillard, your cashier; and Saillard is father-in-law to a\r\ncertain Baudoyer, who thinks he has a right to the vacant place in your\r\nministry. Don’t you think I have done right to come and tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said des Lupeaulx, nodding to the lawyer with a shrewd\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“One stroke of your pen will buy them off,” said Desroches, leaving him.\r\n\r\n“What an immense sacrifice!” muttered des Lupeaulx. “It would be\r\nimpossible to explain it to a woman,” thought he. “Is Celestine worth\r\nmore than the clearing off of my debts?--that is the question. I’ll go\r\nand see her this morning.”\r\n\r\nSo the beautiful Madame Rabourdin was to be, within an hour, the arbiter\r\nof her husband’s fate, and no power on earth could warn her of the\r\nimportance of her replies, or give her the least hint to guard her\r\nconduct and compose her voice. Moreover, in addition to her mischances,\r\nshe believed herself certain of success, never dreaming that Rabourdin\r\nwas undermined in all directions by the secret sapping of the mollusks.\r\n\r\n“Well, Monseigneur,” said des Lupeaulx, entering the little salon where\r\nthey breakfasted, “have you seen the articles on Baudoyer?”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, my dear friend,” replied the minister, “don’t talk of\r\nthose appointments just now; let me have an hour’s peace! They cracked\r\nmy ears last night with that monstrance. The only way to save Rabourdin\r\nis to bring his appointment before the Council, unless I submit to\r\nhaving my hand forced. It is enough to disgust a man with the public\r\nservice. I must purchase the right to keep that excellent Rabourdin by\r\npromoting a certain Colleville!”\r\n\r\n“Why not make over the management of this pretty little comedy to me,\r\nand rid yourself of the worry of it? I’ll amuse you every morning with\r\nan account of the game of chess I should play with the Grand Almoner,”\r\n said des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said the minister, “settle it with the head examiner. But\r\nyou know perfectly well that nothing is more likely to strike the king’s\r\nmind than just those reasons the opposition journal has chosen to put\r\nforth. Good heavens! fancy managing a ministry with such men as Baudoyer\r\nunder me!”\r\n\r\n“An imbecile bigot,” said des Lupeaulx, “and as utterly incapable as--”\r\n\r\n“--as La Billardiere,” added the minister.\r\n\r\n“But La Billardiere had the manners of a gentleman-in-ordinary,” replied\r\ndes Lupeaulx. “Madame,” he continued, addressing the countess, “it\r\nis now an absolute necessity to invite Madame Rabourdin to your next\r\nprivate party. I must assure you she is the intimate friend of Madame\r\nde Camps; they were at the Opera together last night. I first met her at\r\nthe hotel Firmiani. Besides, you will see that she is not of a kind to\r\ncompromise a salon.”\r\n\r\n“Invite Madame Rabourdin, my dear,” said the minister, “and pray let us\r\ntalk of something else.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. SCENES FROM DOMESTIC LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nParisian households are literally eaten up with the desire to be in\r\nkeeping with the luxury that surrounds them on all sides, and few there\r\nare who have the wisdom to let their external situation conform to\r\ntheir internal revenue. But this vice may perhaps denote a truly French\r\npatriotism, which seeks to maintain the supremacy of the nation in the\r\nmatter of dress. France reigns through clothes over the whole of Europe;\r\nand every one must feel the importance of retaining a commercial sceptre\r\nthat makes fashion in France what the navy is to England. This patriotic\r\nardor which leads a nation to sacrifice everything to appearances--to\r\nthe “paroistre,” as d’Aubigne said in the days of Henri IV.--is the\r\ncause of those vast secret labors which employ the whole of a Parisian\r\nwoman’s morning, when she wishes, as Madame Rabourdin wished, to keep\r\nup on twelve thousand francs a year the style that many a family with\r\nthirty thousand does not indulge in. Consequently, every Friday,--the\r\nday of her dinner parties,--Madame Rabourdin helped the chambermaid to\r\ndo the rooms; for the cook went early to market, and the man-servant was\r\ncleaning the silver, folding the napkins, and polishing the glasses.\r\nThe ill-advised individual who might happen, through an oversight of the\r\nporter, to enter Madame Rabourdin’s establishment about eleven o’clock\r\nin the morning would have found her in the midst of a disorder\r\nthe reverse of picturesque, wrapped in a dressing-gown, her hair\r\nill-dressed, and her feet in old slippers, attending to the lamps,\r\narranging the flowers, or cooking in haste an extremely unpoetic\r\nbreakfast. The visitor to whom the mysteries of Parisian life were\r\nunknown would certainly have learned for the rest of his life not to\r\nset foot in these greenrooms at the wrong moment; a woman caught in her\r\nmatin mysteries would ever after point him out as a man capable of the\r\nblackest crimes; or she would talk of his stupidity and indiscretion\r\nin a manner to ruin him. The true Parisian woman, indulgent to all\r\ncuriosity that she can put to profit, is implacable to that which makes\r\nher lose her prestige. Such a domiciliary invasion may be called,\r\nnot only (as they say in police reports) an attack on privacy, but a\r\nburglary, a robbery of all that is most precious, namely, CREDIT. A\r\nwoman is quite willing to let herself be surprised half-dressed, with\r\nher hair about her shoulders. If her hair is all her own she scores one;\r\nbut she will never allow herself to be seen “doing” her own rooms, or\r\nshe loses her pariostre,--that precious /seeming-to-be/!\r\n\r\nMadame Rabourdin was in full tide of preparation for her Friday dinner,\r\nstanding in the midst of provisions the cook had just fished from the\r\nvast ocean of the markets, when Monsieur des Lupeaulx made his way\r\nstealthily in. The general-secretary was certainly the last man Madame\r\nRabourdin expected to see, and so, when she heard his boots creaking\r\nin the ante-chamber, she exclaimed, impatiently, “The hair-dresser\r\nalready!”--an exclamation as little agreeable to des Lupeaulx as the\r\nsight of des Lupeaulx was agreeable to her. She immediately escaped into\r\nher bedroom, where chaos reigned; a jumble of furniture to be put out\r\nof sight, with other heterogeneous articles of more or rather less\r\nelegance,--a domestic carnival, in short. The bold des Lupeaulx followed\r\nthe handsome figure, so piquant did she seem to him in her dishabille.\r\nThere is something indescribably alluring to the eye in a portion of\r\nflesh seen through an hiatus in the undergarment, more attractive far\r\nthan when it rises gracefully above the circular curve of the velvet\r\nbodice, to the vanishing line of the prettiest swan’s-neck that ever\r\nlover kissed before a ball. When the eye dwells on a woman in full dress\r\nmaking exhibition of her magnificent white shoulders, do we not fancy\r\nthat we see the elegant dessert of a grand dinner? But the glance that\r\nglides through the disarray of muslins rumpled in sleep enjoys, as it\r\nwere, a feast of stolen fruit glowing between the leaves on a garden\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n“Stop! wait!” cried the pretty Parisian, bolting the door of the\r\ndisordered room.\r\n\r\nShe rang for Therese, called for her daughter, the cook, and the\r\nman-servant, wishing she possessed the whistle of the machinist at\r\nthe Opera. Her call, however, answered the same purpose. In a moment,\r\nanother phenomenon! the salon assumed a piquant morning look, quite in\r\nkeeping with the becoming toilet hastily got together by the fugitive;\r\nwe say it to her glory, for she was evidently a clever woman, in this at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n“You!” she said, coming forward, “at this hour? What has happened?”\r\n\r\n“Very serious things,” answered des Lupeaulx. “You and I must understand\r\neach other now.”\r\n\r\nCelestine looked at the man behind his glasses, and understood the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n“My principle vice,” she said, “is oddity. For instance, I do not mix\r\nup affections with politics; let us talk politics,--business, if you\r\nwill,--the rest can come later. However, it is not really oddity nor\r\na whim that forbids me to mingle ill-assorted colors and put together\r\nthings that have no affinity, and compels me to avoid discords; it is my\r\nnatural instinct as an artist. We women have politics of our own.”\r\n\r\nAlready the tones of her voice and the charm of her manners were\r\nproducing their effect on the secretary and metamorphosing his roughness\r\ninto sentimental courtesy; she had recalled him to his obligations as a\r\nlover. A clever pretty woman makes an atmosphere about her in which the\r\nnerves relax and the feelings soften.\r\n\r\n“You are ignorant of what is happening,” said des Lupeaulx, harshly, for\r\nhe still thought it best to make a show of harshness. “Read that.”\r\n\r\nHe gave the two newspapers to the graceful woman, having drawn a line in\r\nred ink round each of the famous articles.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” she exclaimed, “but this is dreadful! Who is this\r\nBaudoyer?”\r\n\r\n“A donkey,” answered des Lupeaulx; “but, as you see, he uses means,--he\r\ngives monstrances; he succeeds, thanks to some clever hand that pulls\r\nthe wires.”\r\n\r\nThe thought of her debts crossed Madame Rabourdin’s mind and blurred\r\nher sight, as if two lightning flashes had blinded her eyes at the same\r\nmoment; her ears hummed under the pressure of the blood that began to\r\nbeat in her arteries; she remained for a moment quite bewildered, gazing\r\nat a window which she did not see.\r\n\r\n“But are you faithful to us?” she said at last, with a winning glance at\r\ndes Lupeaulx, as if to attach him to her.\r\n\r\n“That is as it may be,” he replied, answering her glance with an\r\ninterrogative look which made the poor woman blush.\r\n\r\n“If you demand caution-money you may lose all,” she said, laughing; “I\r\nthought you more magnanimous than you are. And you, you thought me less\r\na person than I am,--a sort of school-girl.”\r\n\r\n“You have misunderstood me,” he said, with a covert smile; “I meant that\r\nI could not assist a man who plays against me just as l’Etourdi played\r\nagainst Mascarille.”\r\n\r\n“What can you mean?”\r\n\r\n“This will prove to you whether I am magnanimous or not.”\r\n\r\nHe gave Madame Rabourdin the memorandum stolen by Dutocq, pointing out\r\nto her the passage in which her husband had so ably analyzed him.\r\n\r\n“Read that.”\r\n\r\nCelestine recognized the handwriting, read the paper, and turned pale\r\nunder the blow.\r\n\r\n“All the ministries, the whole service is treated in the same way,” said\r\ndes Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“Happily,” she said, “you alone possess this document. I cannot explain\r\nit, even to myself.”\r\n\r\n“The man who stole it is not such a fool as to let me have it without\r\nkeeping a copy for himself; he is too great a liar to admit it, and too\r\nclever in his business to give it up. I did not even ask him for it.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“Your chief clerk.”\r\n\r\n“Dutocq! People are always punished through their kindnesses! But,” she\r\nadded, “he is only a dog who wants a bone.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what the other side offer me, poor devil of a\r\ngeneral-secretary?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I owe thirty-thousand and odd miserable francs,--you will despise me\r\nbecause it isn’t more, but here, I grant you, I am significant. Well,\r\nBaudoyer’s uncle has bought up my debts, and is, doubtless, ready to\r\ngive me a receipt for them if Baudoyer is appointed.”\r\n\r\n“But all that is monstrous.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; it is monarchical and religious, for the Grand Almoner is\r\nconcerned in it. Baudoyer himself must appoint Colleville in return for\r\necclesiastical assistance.”\r\n\r\n“What shall you do?”\r\n\r\n“What will you bid me do?” he said, with charming grace, holding out his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nCelestine no longer thought him ugly, nor old, nor white and chilling as\r\na hoar-frost, nor indeed anything that was odious and offensive, but she\r\ndid not give him her hand. At night, in her salon, she would have let\r\nhim take it a hundred times, but here, alone and in the morning, the\r\naction seemed too like a promise that might lead her far.\r\n\r\n“And they say that statesmen have no hearts!” she cried\r\nenthusiastically, trying to hide the harshness of her refusal under\r\nthe grace of her words. “The thought used to terrify me,” she added,\r\nassuming an innocent, ingenuous air.\r\n\r\n“What a calumny!” cried des Lupeaulx. “Only this week one of the\r\nstiffest of diplomatists, a man who has been in the service ever since\r\nhe came to manhood, has married the daughter of an actress, and has\r\nintroduced her at the most iron-bound court in Europe as to quarterings\r\nof nobility.”\r\n\r\n“You will continue to support us?”\r\n\r\n“I am to draw up your husband’s appointment--But no cheating, remember.”\r\n\r\nShe gave him her hand to kiss, and tapped him on the cheek as she did\r\nso. “You are mine!” she said.\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx admired the expression.\r\n\r\n[That night, at the Opera, the old coxcomb related the incident as\r\nfollows: “A woman who did not want to tell a man she would be his,--an\r\nacknowledgment a well-bred woman never allows herself to make,--changed\r\nthe words into ‘You are mine.’ Don’t you think the evasion charming?”]\r\n\r\n“But you must be my ally,” he answered. “Now listen, your husband has\r\nspoken to the minister of a plan for the reform of the administration;\r\nthe paper I have shown you is a part of that plan. I want to know what\r\nit is. Find out, and tell me to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” she answered, wholly unaware of the important nature of the\r\nerrand which brought des Lupeaulx to the house that morning.\r\n\r\n“Madame, the hair-dresser.”\r\n\r\n“At last!” thought Celestine. “I don’t see how I should have got out of\r\nit if he had delayed much longer.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know to what lengths my devotion can go,” said des Lupeaulx,\r\nrising. “You shall be invited to the first select party given by his\r\nExcellency’s wife.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you are an angel!” she cried. “And I see now how much you love me;\r\nyou love me intelligently.”\r\n\r\n“To-night, dear child,” he said, “I shall find out at the Opera what\r\njournalists are conspiring for Baudoyer, and we will measure swords\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you must dine with us, will you not? I have taken pains to get\r\nthe things you like best--”\r\n\r\n“All that is so like love,” said des Lupeaulx to himself as he went\r\ndownstairs, “that I am willing to be deceived in that way for a\r\nlong time. Well, if she IS tricking me I shall know it. I’ll set the\r\ncleverest of all traps before the appointment is fairly signed, and I’ll\r\nread her heart. Ah! my little cats, I know you! for, after all, women\r\nare just what we men are. Twenty-eight years old, virtuous, and living\r\nhere in the rue Duphot!--a rare piece of luck and worth cultivating,”\r\n thought the elderly butterfly as he fluttered down the staircase.\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! that man, without his glasses, must look funny enough in\r\na dressing-gown!” thought Celestine, “but the harpoon is in his back and\r\nhe’ll tow me where I want to go; I am sure now of that invitation. He\r\nhas played his part in my comedy.”\r\n\r\nWhen, at five o’clock in the afternoon, Rabourdin came home to dress for\r\ndinner, his wife presided at his toilet and presently laid before him\r\nthe fatal memorandum which, like the slipper in the Arabian Nights, the\r\nluckless man was fated to meet at every turn.\r\n\r\n“Who gave you that?” he asked, thunderstruck.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur des Lupeaulx.”\r\n\r\n“So he has been here!” cried Rabourdin, with a look which would\r\ncertainly have made a guilty woman turn pale, but which Celestine\r\nreceived with unruffled brow and a laughing eye.\r\n\r\n“And he is coming back to dinner,” she said. “Why that startled air?”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” replied Rabourdin, “I have mortally offended des Lupeaulx;\r\nsuch men never forgive, and yet he fawns upon me! Do you think I don’t\r\nsee why?”\r\n\r\n“The man seems to me,” she said, “to have good taste; you can’t expect\r\nme to blame him. I really don’t know anything more flattering to a woman\r\nthan to please a worn-out palate. After--”\r\n\r\n“A truce to nonsense, Celestine. Spare a much-tried man. I cannot get an\r\naudience of the minister, and my honor is at stake.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, no! Dutocq can have the promise of a good place as soon\r\nas you are named head of the division.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I see what you are about, dear child,” said Rabourdin; “but the\r\ngame you are playing is just as dishonorable as the real thing that is\r\ngoing on around us. A lie is a lie, and an honest woman--”\r\n\r\n“Let me use the weapons employed against us.”\r\n\r\n“Celestine, the more that man des Lupeaulx feels he is foolishly caught\r\nin a trap, the more bitter he will be against me.”\r\n\r\n“What if I get him dismissed altogether?”\r\n\r\nRabourdin looked at his wife in amazement.\r\n\r\n“I am thinking only of your advancement; it was high time, my poor\r\nhusband,” continued Celestine. “But you are mistaking the dog for the\r\ngame,” she added, after a pause. “In a few days des Lupeaulx will have\r\naccomplished all that I want of him. While you are trying to speak to\r\nthe minister, and before you can even see him on business, I shall have\r\nseen him and spoken with him. You are worn out in trying to bring that\r\nplan of your brain to birth,--a plan which you have been hiding from me;\r\nbut you will find that in three months your wife has accomplished more\r\nthan you have done in six years. Come, tell me this fine scheme of\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nRabourdin, continuing to shave, cautioned his wife not to say a word\r\nabout his work, and after assuring her that to confide a single idea\r\nto des Lupeaulx would be to put the cat near the milk-jug, he began an\r\nexplanation of his labors.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you tell me this before, Rabourdin?” said Celestine, cutting\r\nher husband short at his fifth sentence. “You might have saved yourself\r\na world of trouble. I can understand that a man should be blinded by an\r\nidea for a moment, but to nurse it up for six or seven years, that’s a\r\nthing I cannot comprehend! You want to reduce the budget,--a vulgar\r\nand commonplace idea! The budget ought, on the contrary, to reach two\r\nhundred millions. Then, indeed, France would be great. If you want a new\r\nsystem let it be one of loans, as Monsieur de Nucingen keeps saying. The\r\npoorest of all treasuries is the one with a surplus that it never\r\nuses; the mission of a minister of finance is to fling gold out of the\r\nwindows. It will come back to him through the cellars; and you, you\r\nwant to hoard it! The thing to do is to increase the offices and all\r\ngovernment employments, instead of reducing them! So far from lessening\r\nthe public debt, you ought to increase the creditors. If the Bourbons\r\nwant to reign in peace, let them seek creditors in the towns and\r\nvillages, and place their loans there; above all, they ought not to\r\nlet foreigners draw interest away from France; some day an alien nation\r\nmight ask us for the capital. Whereas if capital and interest are held\r\nonly in France, neither France nor credit can perish. That’s what saved\r\nEngland. Your plan is the tradesman’s plan. An ambitious public man\r\nshould produce some bold scheme,--he should make himself another Law,\r\nwithout Law’s fatal ill-luck; he ought to exhibit the power of credit,\r\nand show that we should reduce, not principal, but interest, as they do\r\nin England.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, Celestine,” said Rabourdin; “mix up ideas as much as\r\nyou please, and make fun of them,--I’m accustomed to that; but don’t\r\ncriticise a work of which you know nothing as yet.”\r\n\r\n“Do I need,” she asked, “to know a scheme the essence of which is to\r\ngovern France with a civil service of six thousand men instead of twenty\r\nthousand? My dear friend, even allowing it were the plan of a man of\r\ngenius, a king of France who attempted to carry it out would get himself\r\ndethroned. You can keep down a feudal aristocracy by levelling a few\r\nheads, but you can’t subdue a hydra with thousands. And is it with the\r\npresent ministers--between ourselves, a wretched crew--that you expect\r\nto carry out your reform? No, no; change the monetary system if you\r\nwill, but do not meddle with men, with little men; they cry out too\r\nmuch, whereas gold is dumb.”\r\n\r\n“But, Celestine, if you will talk, and put wit before argument, we shall\r\nnever understand each other.”\r\n\r\n“Understand! I understand what that paper, in which you have analyzed\r\nthe capacities of the men in office, will lead to,” she replied, paying\r\nno attention to what her husband said. “Good heavens! you have sharpened\r\nthe axe to cut off your own head. Holy Virgin! why didn’t you consult\r\nme? I could have at least prevented you from committing anything to\r\nwriting, or, at any rate, if you insisted on putting it to paper, I\r\nwould have written it down myself, and it should never have left this\r\nhouse. Good God! to think that he never told me! That’s what men are!\r\ncapable of sleeping with the wife of their bosom for seven years, and\r\nkeeping a secret from her! Hiding their thoughts from a poor woman for\r\nseven years!--doubting her devotion!”\r\n\r\n“But,” cried Rabourdin, provoked, “for eleven years and more I have been\r\nunable to discuss anything with you because you insist on cutting me\r\nshort and substituting your ideas for mine. You know nothing at all\r\nabout my scheme.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing! I know all.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell it to me!” cried Rabourdin, angry for the first time since\r\nhis marriage.\r\n\r\n“There! it is half-past six o’clock; finish shaving and dress at once,”\r\n she cried hastily, after the fashion of women when pressed on a point\r\nthey are not ready to talk of. “I must go; we’ll adjourn the discussion,\r\nfor I don’t want to be nervous on a reception-day. Good heavens! the\r\npoor soul!” she thought, as she left the room, “it /is/ hard to be in\r\nlabor for seven years and bring forth a dead child! And not trust his\r\nwife!”\r\n\r\nShe went back into the room.\r\n\r\n“If you had listened to me you would never had interceded to keep your\r\nchief clerk; he stole that abominable paper, and has, no doubt, kept a\r\nfac-simile of it. Adieu, man of genius!”\r\n\r\nThen she noticed the almost tragic expression of her husband’s grief;\r\nshe felt she had gone too far, and ran to him, seized him just as he\r\nwas, all lathered with soap-suds, and kissed him tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Dear Xavier, don’t be vexed,” she said. “To-night, after the people\r\nare gone, we will study your plan; you shall speak at your ease,--I will\r\nlisten just as long as you wish me to. Isn’t that nice of me? What do I\r\nwant better than to be the wife of Mohammed?”\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh; and Rabourdin laughed too, for the soapsuds were\r\nclinging to Celestine’s lips, and her voice had the tones of the purest\r\nand most steadfast affection.\r\n\r\n“Go and dress, dear child; and above all, don’t say a word of this to\r\ndes Lupeaulx. Swear you will not. That is the only punishment that I\r\nimpose--”\r\n\r\n“/Impose/!” she cried. “Then I won’t swear anything.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, Celestine, I said in jest a really serious thing.”\r\n\r\n“To-night,” she said, “I mean your general-secretary to know whom I am\r\nreally intending to attack; he has given me the means.”\r\n\r\n“Attack whom?”\r\n\r\n“The minister,” she answered, drawing himself up. “We are to be invited\r\nto his wife’s private parties.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his Celestine’s loving caresses, Rabourdin, as he finished\r\ndressing, could not prevent certain painful thoughts from clouding his\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\n“Will she ever appreciate me?” he said to himself. “She does not\r\neven understand that she is the sole incentive of my whole work. How\r\nwrong-headed, and yet how excellent a mind!--If I had not married I\r\nmight now have been high in office and rich. I could have saved half my\r\nsalary; my savings well-invested would have given me to-day ten thousand\r\nfrancs a year outside of my office, and I might then have become,\r\nthrough a good marriage--Yes, that is all true,” he exclaimed,\r\ninterrupting himself, “but I have Celestine and my two children.” The\r\nman flung himself back on his happiness. To the best of married lives\r\nthere come moments of regret. He entered the salon and looked around\r\nhim. “There are not two women in Paris who understand making life\r\npleasant as she does. To keep such a home as this on twelve thousand\r\nfrancs a year!” he thought, looking at the flower-stands bright with\r\nbloom, and thinking of the social enjoyments that were about to gratify\r\nhis vanity. “She was made to be the wife of a minister. When I think of\r\nhis Excellency’s wife, and how little she helps him! the good woman is a\r\ncomfortable middle-class dowdy, and when she goes to the palace or into\r\nsociety--” He pinched his lips together. Very busy men are apt to have\r\nvery ignorant notions about household matters, and you can make them\r\nbelieve that a hundred thousand francs afford little or that twelve\r\nthousand afford all.\r\n\r\nThough impatiently expected, and in spite of the flattering dishes\r\nprepared for the palate of the gourmet-emeritus, des Lupeaulx did not\r\ncome to dinner; in fact he came in very late, about midnight, an\r\nhour when company dwindles and conversations become intimate and\r\nconfidential. Andoche Finot, the journalist, was one of the few\r\nremaining guests.\r\n\r\n“I now know all,” said des Lupeaulx, when he was comfortably seated on a\r\nsofa at the corner of the fireplace, a cup of tea in his hand and Madame\r\nRabourdin standing before him with a plate of sandwiches and some slices\r\nof cake very appropriately called “leaden cake.” “Finot, my dear and\r\nwitty friend, you can render a great service to our gracious queen\r\nby letting loose a few dogs upon the men we were talking of. You have\r\nagainst you,” he said to Rabourdin, lowering his voice so as to be\r\nheard only by the three persons whom he addressed, “a set of usurers and\r\npriests--money and the church. The article in the liberal journal\r\nwas instituted by an old money-lender to whom the paper was under\r\nobligations; but the young fellow who wrote it cares nothing about it.\r\nThe paper is about to change hands, and in three days more will be on\r\nour side. The royalist opposition,--for we have, thanks to Monsieur de\r\nChateaubriand, a royalist opposition, that is to say, royalists who\r\nhave gone over to the liberals,--however, there’s no need to discuss\r\npolitical matters now,--these assassins of Charles X. have promised me\r\nto support your appointment at the price of our acquiescence in one of\r\ntheir amendments. All my batteries are manned. If they threaten us with\r\nBaudoyer we shall say to the clerical phalanx, ‘Such and such a paper\r\nand such and such men will attack your measures and the whole press will\r\nbe against you’ (for even the ministerial journals which I influence\r\nwill be deaf and dumb, won’t they, Finot?). ‘Appoint Rabourdin, a\r\nfaithful servant, and public opinion is with you--’”\r\n\r\n“Hi, hi!” laughed Finot.\r\n\r\n“So, there’s no need to be uneasy,” said des Lupeaulx. “I have arranged\r\nit all to-night; the Grand Almoner must yield.”\r\n\r\n“I would rather have had less hope, and you to dinner,” whispered\r\nCelestine, looking at him with a vexed air which might very well pass\r\nfor an expression of wounded love.\r\n\r\n“This must win my pardon,” he returned, giving her an invitation to the\r\nministry for the following Tuesday.\r\n\r\nCelestine opened the letter, and a flush of pleasure came into her face.\r\nNo enjoyment can be compared to that of gratified vanity.\r\n\r\n“You know what the countess’s Tuesdays are,” said des Lupeaulx, with a\r\nconfidential air. “To the usual ministerial parties they are what the\r\n‘Petit-Chateau’ is to a court ball. You will be at the heart of\r\npower! You will see there the Comtesse Feraud, who is still in favor\r\nnotwithstanding Louis XVIII.’s death, Delphine de Nucingen, Madame de\r\nListomere, the Marquise d’Espard, and your dear Firmiani; I have had\r\nher invited to give you her support in case the other women attempt to\r\nblack-ball you. I long to see you in the midst of them.”\r\n\r\nCelestine threw up her head like a thoroughbred before the race, and\r\nre-read the invitation just as Baudoyer and Saillard had re-read the\r\narticles about themselves in the newspapers, without being able to quaff\r\nenough of it.\r\n\r\n“/There/ first, and /next/ at the Tuileries,” she said to des Lupeaulx,\r\nwho was startled by the words and by the attitude of the speaker, so\r\nexpressive were they of ambition and security.\r\n\r\n“Can it be that I am only a stepping-stone?” he asked himself. He\r\nrose, and went into Madame Rabourdin’s bedroom, where she followed him,\r\nunderstanding from a motion of his head that he wished to speak to her\r\nprivately.\r\n\r\n“Well, your husband’s plan,” he said; “what of it?”\r\n\r\n“Bah! the useless nonsense of an honest man!” she replied. “He wants\r\nto suppress fifteen thousand offices and do the work with five or six\r\nthousand. You never heard of such nonsense; I will let you read the\r\nwhole document when copied; it is written in perfect good faith.\r\nHis analysis of the officials was prompted only by his honesty and\r\nrectitude,--poor dear man!”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx was all the more reassured by the genuine laugh which\r\naccompanied these jesting and contemptuous words, because he was a judge\r\nof lying and knew that Celestine spoke in good faith.\r\n\r\n“But still, what is at the bottom of it all?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, he wants to do away with the land-tax and substitute taxes on\r\nconsumption.”\r\n\r\n“Why it is over a year since Francois Keller and Nucingen proposed some\r\nsuch plan, and the minister himself is thinking of a reduction of the\r\nland-tax.”\r\n\r\n“There!” exclaimed Celestine, “I told him there was nothing new in his\r\nscheme.”\r\n\r\n“No; but he is on the same ground with the best financier of the\r\nepoch,--the Napoleon of finance. Something may come of it. Your husband\r\nmust surely have some special ideas in his method of putting the scheme\r\ninto practice.”\r\n\r\n“No, it is all commonplace,” she said, with a disdainful curl of her\r\nlip. “Just think of governing France with five or six thousand offices,\r\nwhen what is really needed is that everybody in France should be\r\npersonally enlisted in the support of the government.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx seemed satisfied that Rabourdin, to whom in his own mind he\r\nhad granted remarkable talents, was really a man of mediocrity.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure of the appointment? You don’t want a bit of feminine\r\nadvice?” she said.\r\n\r\n“You women are greater adepts than we in refined treachery,” he said,\r\nnodding.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, say /Baudoyer/ to the court and clergy, to divert suspicion\r\nand put them to sleep, and then, at the last moment, write /Rabourdin/.”\r\n\r\n“There are some women who say /yes/ as long as they need a man, and /no/\r\nwhen he has played his part,” returned des Lupeaulx, significantly.\r\n\r\n“I know they do,” she answered, laughing; “but they are very foolish,\r\nfor in politics everything recommences. Such proceedings may do with\r\nfools, but you are a man of sense. In my opinion the greatest folly any\r\none can commit is to quarrel with a clever man.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken,” said des Lupeaulx, “for such a man pardons. The real\r\ndanger is with the petty spiteful natures who have nothing to do but\r\nstudy revenge,--I spend my life among them.”\r\n\r\nWhen all the guests were gone, Rabourdin came into his wife’s room, and\r\nafter asking for her strict attention, he explained his plan and\r\nmade her see that it did not cut down the revenue but on the contrary\r\nincreased it; he showed her in what ways the public funds were employed,\r\nand how the State could increase tenfold the circulation of money by\r\nputting its own, in the proportion of a third, or a quarter, into the\r\nexpenditures which would be sustained by private or local interests. He\r\nfinally proved to her plainly that his plan was not mere theory, but\r\na system teeming with methods of execution. Celestine, brightly\r\nenthusiastic, sprang into her husband’s arms and sat upon his knee in\r\nthe chimney-corner.\r\n\r\n“At last I find the husband of my dreams!” she cried. “My ignorance of\r\nyour real merit has saved you from des Lupeaulx’s claws. I calumniated\r\nyou to him gloriously and in good faith.”\r\n\r\nThe man wept with joy. His day of triumph had come at last. Having\r\nlabored for many years to satisfy his wife, he found himself a great man\r\nin the eyes of his sole public.\r\n\r\n“To one who knows how good you are, how tender, how equable in anger,\r\nhow loving, you are tenfold greater still. But,” she added, “a man of\r\ngenius is always more or less a child; and you are a child, a dearly\r\nbeloved child,” she said, caressing him. Then she drew that invitation\r\nfrom that particular spot where women put what they sacredly hide, and\r\nshowed it to him.\r\n\r\n“Here is what I wanted,” she said; “Des Lupeaulx has put me face to face\r\nwith the minister, and were he a man of iron, his Excellency shall be\r\nmade for a time to bend the knee to me.”\r\n\r\nThe next day Celestine began her preparations for entrance into the\r\ninner circle of the ministry. It was her day of triumph, her own! Never\r\ncourtesan took such pains with herself as this honest woman bestowed\r\nupon her person. No dressmaker was ever so tormented as hers. Madame\r\nRabourdin forgot nothing. She went herself to the stable where she hired\r\ncarriages, and chose a coupe that was neither old, nor bourgeois, nor\r\nshowy. Her footman, like the footmen of great houses, had the dress\r\nand appearance of a master. About ten on the evening of the eventful\r\nTuesday, she left home in a charming full mourning attire. Her hair was\r\ndressed with jet grapes of exquisite workmanship,--an ornament costing\r\nthree thousand francs, made by Fossin for an Englishwoman who had left\r\nParis before it was finished. The leaves were of stamped iron-work, as\r\nlight as the vine-leaves themselves, and the artist had not forgotten\r\nthe graceful tendrils, which twined in the wearer’s curls just as,\r\nin nature, they catch upon the branches. The bracelets, necklace, and\r\nearrings were all what is called Berlin iron-work; but these delicate\r\narabesques were made in Vienna, and seemed to have been fashioned by the\r\nfairies who, the stories tell us, are condemned by a jealous Carabosse\r\nto collect the eyes of ants, or weave a fabric so diaphanous that a\r\nnutshell can contain it. Madame Rabourdin’s graceful figure, made\r\nmore slender still by the black draperies, was shown to advantage by a\r\ncarefully cut dress, the two sides of which met at the shoulders in\r\na single strap without sleeves. At every motion she seemed, like a\r\nbutterfly, to be about to leave her covering; but the gown held firmly\r\non by some contrivance of the wonderful dressmaker. The robe was of\r\nmousseline de laine--a material which the manufacturers had not yet sent\r\nto the Paris markets; a delightful stuff which some months later was to\r\nhave a wild success, a success which went further and lasted longer than\r\nmost French fashions. The actual economy of mousseline de laine, which\r\nneeds no washing, has since injured the sale of cotton fabrics enough to\r\nrevolutionize the Rouen manufactories. Celestine’s little feet, covered\r\nwith fine silk stockings and turk-satin shoes (for silk-satin is\r\ninadmissible in deep mourning) were of elegant proportions. Thus\r\ndressed, she was very handsome. Her complexion, beautified by a\r\nbran-bath, was softly radiant. Her eyes, suffused with the light of\r\nhope, and sparkling with intelligence, justified her claims to the\r\nsuperiority which des Lupeaulx, proud and happy on this occasion,\r\nasserted for her.\r\n\r\nShe entered the room well (women will understand the meaning of that\r\nexpression), bowed gracefully to the minister’s wife, with a happy\r\nmixture of deference and of self-respect, and gave no offence by a\r\ncertain reliance on her own dignity; for every beautiful woman has the\r\nright to seem a queen. With the minister himself she took the pretty air\r\nof sauciness which women may properly allow themselves with men, even\r\nwhen they are grand dukes. She reconnoitred the field, as it were,\r\nwhile taking her seat, and saw that she was in the midst of one of those\r\nselect parties of few persons, where the women eye and appraise each\r\nother, and every word said echoes in all ears; where every glance is\r\na stab, and conversation a duel with witnesses; where all that is\r\ncommonplace seems commoner still, and where every form of merit or\r\ndistinction is silently accepted as though it were the natural level of\r\nall present. Rabourdin betook himself to the adjoining salon in which\r\na few persons were playing cards; and there he planted himself on\r\nexhibition, as it were, which proved that he was not without social\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said the Marquise d’Espard to the Comtesse Feraud, Louis\r\nXVIII.’s last mistress, “Paris is certainly unique. It produces--whence\r\nand how, who knows?--women like this person, who seems ready to will and\r\nto do anything.”\r\n\r\n“She really does will, and does do everything,” put in des Lupeaulx,\r\npuffed up with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the wily Madame Rabourdin was courting the minister’s\r\nwife. Carefully coached the evening before by des Lupeaulx, who knew all\r\nthe countess’s weak spots, she was flattering her without seeming to do\r\nso. Every now and then she kept silence; for des Lupeaulx, in love as he\r\nwas, knew her defects, and said to her the night before, “Be careful\r\nnot to talk too much,”--words which were really an immense proof of\r\nattachment. Bertrand Barrere left behind him this sublime axiom: “Never\r\ninterrupt a woman when dancing to give her advice,” to which we may add\r\n(to make this chapter of the female code complete), “Never blame a woman\r\nfor scattering her pearls.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation became general. From time to time Madame Rabourdin\r\njoined in, just as a well-trained cat puts a velvet paw on her\r\nmistress’s laces with the claws carefully drawn in. The minister, in\r\nmatters of the heart, had few emotions. There was not another statesman\r\nunder the Restoration who had so completely done with gallantry as he;\r\neven the opposition papers, the “Miroir,” “Pandora,” and “Figaro,” could\r\nnot find a single throbbing artery with which to reproach him. Madame\r\nRabourdin knew this, but she knew also that ghosts return to old\r\ncastles, and she had taken it into her head to make the minister jealous\r\nof the happiness which des Lupeaulx was appearing to enjoy. The latter’s\r\nthroat literally gurgled with the name of his divinity. To launch his\r\nsupposed mistress successfully, he was endeavoring to persuade the\r\nMarquise d’Espard, Madame de Nucingen, and the countess, in an eight-ear\r\nconversation, that they had better admit Madame Rabourdin to their\r\ncoalition; and Madame de Camps was supporting him. At the end of the\r\nhour the minister’s vanity was greatly tickled; Madame Rabourdin’s\r\ncleverness pleased him, and she had won his wife, who, delighted with\r\nthe siren, invited her to come to all her receptions whenever she\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n“For your husband, my dear,” she said, “will soon be director; the\r\nminister intends to unite the two divisions and place them under one\r\ndirector; you will then be one of us, you know.”\r\n\r\nHis Excellency carried off Madame Rabourdin on his arm to show her a\r\ncertain room, which was then quite celebrated because the opposition\r\njournals blamed him for decorating it extravagantly; and together they\r\nlaughed over the absurdities of journalism.\r\n\r\n“Madame, you really must give the countess and myself the pleasure of\r\nseeing you here often.”\r\n\r\nAnd he went on with a round of ministerial compliments.\r\n\r\n“But, Monseigneur,” she replied, with one of those glances which women\r\nhold in reserve, “it seems to me that that depends on you.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“You alone can give me the right to come here.”\r\n\r\n“Pray explain.”\r\n\r\n“No; I said to myself before I came that I would certainly not have the\r\nbad taste to seem a petitioner.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, speak freely. Places asked in this way are never out of place,”\r\n said the minister, laughing; for there is no jest too silly to amuse a\r\nsolemn man.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I must tell you plainly that the wife of the head of a\r\nbureau is out of place here; a director’s wife is not.”\r\n\r\n“That point need not be considered,” said the minister, “your husband is\r\nindispensable to the administration; he is already appointed.”\r\n\r\n“Is that a veritable fact?”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to see the papers in my study? They are already drawn\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” she said, pausing in a corner where she was alone with the\r\nminister, whose eager attentions were now very marked, “let me tell you\r\nthat I can make you a return.”\r\n\r\nShe was on the point of revealing her husband’s plan, when des Lupeaulx,\r\nwho had glided noiselessly up to them, uttered an angry sound, which\r\nmeant that he did not wish to appear to have overheard what, in fact, he\r\nhad been listening to. The minister gave an ill-tempered look at the\r\nold beau, who, impatient to win his reward, had hurried, beyond all\r\nprecedent, the preliminary work of the appointment. He had carried the\r\npapers to his Excellency that evening, and desired to take himself,\r\non the morrow, the news of the appointment to her whom he was now\r\nendeavoring to exhibit as his mistress. Just then the minister’s valet\r\napproached des Lupeaulx in a mysterious manner, and told him that his\r\nown servant wished him to deliver to him at once a letter of the utmost\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe general-secretary went up to a lamp and read a note thus worded:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Contrary to my custom, I am waiting in your ante-chamber to see\r\n   you; you have not a moment to lose if you wish to come to terms\r\n   with\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant, Gobseck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secretary shuddered when he saw the signature, which we regret we\r\ncannot give in fac-simile, for it would be valuable to those who like to\r\nguess character from what may be called the physiognomy of signature.\r\nIf ever a hieroglyphic sign expressed an animal, it was assuredly this\r\nwritten name, in which the first and the final letter approached each\r\nother like the voracious jaws of a shark,--insatiable, always open,\r\nseeking whom to devour, both strong and weak. As for the wording of\r\nthe note, the spirit of usury alone could have inspired a sentence so\r\nimperative, so insolently curt and cruel, which said all and revealed\r\nnothing. Those who had never heard of Gobseck would have felt, on\r\nreading words which compelled him to whom they were addressed to obey,\r\nyet gave no order, the presence of the implacable money-lender of the\r\nrue des Gres. Like a dog called to heel by the huntsman, des Lupeaulx\r\nleft his present quest and went immediately to his own rooms, thinking\r\nof his hazardous position. Imagine a general to whom an aide-de-camp\r\nrides up and says: “The enemy with thirty thousand fresh troops is\r\nattacking on our right flank.”\r\n\r\nA very few words will serve to explain this sudden arrival of Gigonnet\r\nand Gobseck on the field of battle,--for des Lupeaulx found them both\r\nwaiting. At eight o’clock that evening, Martin Falleix, returning on the\r\nwings of the wind,--thanks to three francs to the postboys and a courier\r\nin advance,--had brought back with him the deeds of the property signed\r\nthe night before. Taken at once to the Cafe Themis by Mitral, these\r\nsecurities passed into the hands of the two usurers, who hastened\r\n(though on foot) to the ministry. It was past eleven o’clock. Des\r\nLupeaulx trembled when he saw those sinister faces, emitting a\r\nsimultaneous look as direct as a pistol shot and as brilliant as the\r\nflash itself.\r\n\r\n“What is it, my masters?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe two extortioners continued cold and motionless. Gigonnet silently\r\npointed to the documents in his hand, and then at the servant.\r\n\r\n“Come into my study,” said des Lupeaulx, dismissing his valet by a sign.\r\n\r\n“You understand French very well,” remarked Gigonnet, approvingly.\r\n\r\n“Have you come here to torment a man who enabled each of you to make a\r\ncouple of hundred thousand francs?”\r\n\r\n“And who will help us to make more, I hope,” said Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“Some new affair?” asked des Lupeaulx. “If you want me to help you,\r\nconsider that I recollect the past.”\r\n\r\n“So do we,” answered Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“My debts must be paid,” said des Lupeaulx, disdainfully, so as not to\r\nseem worsted at the outset.\r\n\r\n“True,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Let us come to the point, my son,” said Gigonnet. “Don’t stiffen your\r\nchin in your cravat; with us all that is useless. Take these deeds and\r\nread them.”\r\n\r\nThe two usurers took a mental inventory of des Lupeaulx’s study while\r\nhe read with amazement and stupefaction a deed of purchase which seemed\r\nwafted to him from the clouds by angels.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think you have a pair of intelligent business agents in\r\nGobseck and me?” asked Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“But tell me, to what do I owe such able co-operation?” said des\r\nLupeaulx, suspicious and uneasy.\r\n\r\n“We knew eight days ago a fact that without us you would not have known\r\ntill to-morrow morning. The president of the chamber of commerce, a\r\ndeputy, as you know, feels himself obliged to resign.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx’s eyes dilated, and were as big as daisies.\r\n\r\n“Your minister has been tricking you about this event,” said the concise\r\nGobseck.\r\n\r\n“You master me,” said the general-secretary, bowing with an air of\r\nprofound respect, bordering however, on sarcasm.\r\n\r\n“True,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Can you mean to strangle me?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, begin your work, executioners,” said the secretary,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n“You will see,” resumed Gigonnet, “that the sum total of your debts is\r\nadded to the sum loaned by us for the purchase of the property; we have\r\nbought them up.”\r\n\r\n“Here are the deeds,” said Gobseck, taking from the pocket of his\r\ngreenish overcoat a number of legal papers.\r\n\r\n“You have three years in which to pay off the whole sum,” said Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“But,” said des Lupeaulx, frightened at such kindness, and also by so\r\napparently fantastic an arrangement. “What do you want of me?”\r\n\r\n“La Billardiere’s place for Baudoyer,” said Gigonnet, quickly.\r\n\r\n“That’s a small matter, though it will be next to impossible for me to\r\ndo it,” said des Lupeaulx. “I have just tied my hands.”\r\n\r\n“Bite the cords with your teeth,” said Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“They are sharp,” added Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Is that all?” asked des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“We keep the title-deeds of the property till the debts are paid,” said\r\nGigonnet, putting one of the papers before des Lupeaulx; “and if the\r\nmatter of the appointment is not satisfactorily arranged within six days\r\nour names will be substituted in place of yours.”\r\n\r\n“You are deep,” cried the secretary.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“And this is all?” exclaimed des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“All,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“You agree?” asked Gigonnet.\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, sign this power of attorney. Within two days Baudoyer is to\r\nbe nominated; within six your debts will be cleared off, and--”\r\n\r\n“And what?” asked des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“We guarantee--”\r\n\r\n“Guarantee!--what?” said the secretary, more and more astonished.\r\n\r\n“Your election to the Chamber,” said Gigonnet, rising on his heels.\r\n“We have secured a majority of fifty-two farmers’ and mechanics’\r\nvotes, which will be thrown precisely as those who lend you this money\r\ndictate.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx wrung Gigonnet’s hand.\r\n\r\n“It is only such as we who never misunderstand each other,” he said;\r\n“this is what I call doing business. I’ll make you a return gift.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Gigonnet.\r\n\r\n“The cross of the Legion of honor for your imbecile of a nephew.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Gigonnet, “I see you know him well.”\r\n\r\nThe pair took leave of des Lupeaulx, who conducted them to the\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\n“They must be secret envoys from foreign powers,” whispered the footmen\r\nto each other.\r\n\r\nOnce in the street, the two usurers looked at each other under a street\r\nlamp and laughed.\r\n\r\n“He will owe us nine thousand francs interest a year,” said Gigonnet;\r\n“that property doesn’t bring him in five.”\r\n\r\n“He is under our thumb for a long time,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“He’ll build; he’ll commit extravagancies,” continued Gigonnet; “Falleix\r\nwill get his land.”\r\n\r\n“His interest is only to be made deputy; the old fox laughs at the\r\nrest,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\n“Hey! hey!”\r\n\r\n“Hi! hi!”\r\n\r\nThese dry little exclamations served as a laugh to the two old men, who\r\ntook their way back (always on foot) to the Cafe Themis.\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx returned to the salon and found Madame Rabourdin sailing\r\nwith the wind of success, and very charming; while his Excellency,\r\nusually so gloomy, showed a smooth and gracious countenance.\r\n\r\n“She performs miracles,” thought des Lupeaulx. “What a wonderfully\r\nclever woman! I must get to the bottom of her heart.”\r\n\r\n“Your little lady is decidedly handsome,” said the Marquise to the\r\nsecretary; “now if she only had your name.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, her defect is that she is the daughter of an auctioneer. She will\r\nfail for want of birth,” replied des Lupeaulx, with a cold manner\r\nthat contrasted strangely with the ardor of his remarks about Madame\r\nRabourdin not half an hour earlier.\r\n\r\nThe marquise looked at him fixedly.\r\n\r\n“The glance you gave them did not escape me,” she said, motioning\r\ntowards the minister and Madame Rabourdin; “it pierced the mask of your\r\nspectacles. How amusing you both are, to quarrel over that bone!”\r\n\r\nAs the marquise turned to leave the room the minister joined her and\r\nescorted her to the door.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said des Lupeaulx to Madame Rabourdin, “what do you think of his\r\nExcellency?”\r\n\r\n“He is charming. We must know these poor ministers to appreciate\r\nthem,” she added, slightly raising her voice so as to be heard by his\r\nExcellency’s wife. “The newspapers and the opposition calumnies are so\r\nmisleading about men in politics that we are all more or less influenced\r\nby them; but such prejudices turn to the advantage of statesmen when we\r\ncome to know them personally.”\r\n\r\n“He is very good-looking,” said des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I assure you he is quite lovable,” she said, heartily.\r\n\r\n“Dear child,” said des Lupeaulx, with a genial, caressing manner; “you\r\nhave actually done the impossible.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Resuscitated the dead. I did not think that man had a heart; ask his\r\nwife. But he may have just enough for a passing fancy. Therefore profit\r\nby it. Come this way, and don’t be surprised.” He led Madame Rabourdin\r\ninto the boudoir, placed her on a sofa, and sat down beside her. “You\r\nare very sly,” he said, “and I like you the better for it. Between\r\nourselves, you are a clever woman. Des Lupeaulx served to bring you\r\ninto this house, and that is all you wanted of him, isn’t it? Now when a\r\nwoman decides to love a man for what she can get out of him it is better\r\nto take a sexagenarian Excellency than a quadragenarian secretary;\r\nthere’s more profit and less annoyance. I’m a man with spectacles,\r\ngrizzled hair, worn out with dissipation,--a fine lover, truly! I tell\r\nmyself all this again and again. It must be admitted, of course, that I\r\ncan sometimes be useful, but never agreeable. Isn’t that so? A man must\r\nbe a fool if he cannot reason about himself. You can safely admit the\r\ntruth and let me see to the depths of your heart; we are partners, not\r\nlovers. If I show some tenderness at times, you are too superior a woman\r\nto pay any attention to such follies; you will forgive me,--you are not\r\na school-girl, or a bourgeoise of the rue Saint-Denis. Bah! you and I\r\nare too well brought up for that. There’s the Marquise d’Espard who has\r\njust left the room; this is precisely what she thinks and does. She and\r\nI came to an understanding two years ago [the coxcomb!], and now she has\r\nonly to write me a line and say, ‘My dear des Lupeaulx, you will oblige\r\nme by doing such and such a thing,’ and it is done at once. We are\r\nengaged at this very moment in getting a commission of lunacy on her\r\nhusband. Ah! you women, you can get what you want by the bestowal of a\r\nfew favors. Well, then, my dear child, bewitch the minister. I’ll help\r\nyou; it is my interest to do so. Yes, I wish he had a woman who could\r\ninfluence him; he wouldn’t escape me,--for he does escape me quite\r\noften, and the reason is that I hold him only through his intellect.\r\nNow if I were one with a pretty woman who was also intimate with him,\r\nI should hold him by his weaknesses, and that is much the firmest grip.\r\nTherefore, let us be friends, you and I, and share the advantages of the\r\nconquest you are making.”\r\n\r\nMadame Rabourdin listened in amazement to this singular profession of\r\nrascality. The apparent artlessness of this political swindler prevented\r\nher from suspecting a trick.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe he really thinks of me?” she asked, falling into the\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\n“I know it; I am certain of it.”\r\n\r\n“Is it true that Rabourdin’s appointment is signed?”\r\n\r\n“I gave him the papers this morning. But it is not enough that your\r\nhusband should be made director; he must be Master of petitions.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, go back to the salon and coquette a little more with his\r\nExcellency.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” she said, “that I never fully understood you till\r\nto-night. There is nothing commonplace about /you/.”\r\n\r\n“We will be two old friends,” said des Lupeaulx, “and suppress all\r\ntender nonsense and tormenting love; we will take things as they did\r\nunder the Regency. Ah! they had plenty of wit and wisdom in those days!”\r\n\r\n“You are really strong; you deserve my admiration,” she said, smiling,\r\nand holding out her hand to him, “one does more for one’s friend, you\r\nknow, than for one’s--”\r\n\r\nShe left him without finishing her sentence.\r\n\r\n“Dear creature!” thought des Lupeaulx, as he saw her approach the\r\nminister, “des Lupeaulx has no longer the slightest remorse in turning\r\nagainst you. To-morrow evening when you offer me a cup of tea, you will\r\nbe offering me a thing I no longer care for. All is over. Ah! when a man\r\nis forty years of age women may take pains to catch him, but they won’t\r\nlove him.”\r\n\r\nHe looked himself over in a mirror, admitting honestly that though he\r\ndid very well as a politician he was a wreck on the shores of Cythera.\r\nAt the same moment Madame Rabourdin was gathering herself together for\r\na becoming exit. She wished to make a last graceful impression on\r\nthe minds of all, and she succeeded. Contrary to the usual custom in\r\nsociety, every one cried out as soon as she was gone, “What a charming\r\nwoman!” and the minister himself took her to the outer door.\r\n\r\n“I am quite sure you will think of me to-morrow,” he said, alluding to\r\nthe appointment.\r\n\r\n“There are so few high functionaries who have agreeable wives,” remarked\r\nhis Excellency on re-entering the room, “that I am very well satisfied\r\nwith our new acquisition.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think her a little overpowering?” said des Lupeaulx with a\r\npiqued air.\r\n\r\nThe women present all exchanged expressive glances; the rivalry between\r\nthe minister and his secretary amused them and instigated one of those\r\npretty little comedies which Parisian women play so well. They excited\r\nand led on his Excellency and des Lupeaulx by a series of comments on\r\nMadame Rabourdin: one thought her too studied in manner, too eager to\r\nappear clever; another compared the graces of the middle classes with\r\nthe manners of high life, while des Lupeaulx defended his pretended\r\nmistress as we all defend an enemy in society.\r\n\r\n“Do her justice, ladies,” he said; “is it not extraordinary that the\r\ndaughter of an auctioneer should appear as well as she does? See where\r\nshe came from, and what she is. She will end in the Tuileries; that is\r\nwhat she intends,--she told me so.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose she is the daughter of an auctioneer,” said the Comtesse\r\nFeraud, smiling, “that will not hinder her husband’s rise to power.”\r\n\r\n“Not in these days, you mean,” said the minister’s wife, tightening her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said his Excellency to the countess, sternly, “such sentiments\r\nand such speeches lead to revolutions; unhappily, the court and the\r\ngreat world do not restrain them. You would hardly believe, however, how\r\nthe injudicious conduct of the aristocracy in this respect displeases\r\ncertain clear-sighted personages at the palace. If I were a great lord,\r\ninstead of being, as I am, a mere country gentleman who seems to be\r\nplaced where he is to transact your business for you, the monarchy would\r\nnot be as insecure as I now think it is. What becomes of a throne which\r\ndoes not bestow dignity on those who administer its government? We are\r\nfar indeed from the days when a king could make men great at will,--such\r\nmen as Louvois, Colbert, Richelieu, Jeannin, Villeroy, Sully,--Sully,\r\nin his origin, was no greater than I. I speak to you thus because we\r\nare here in private among ourselves. I should be very paltry indeed if\r\nI were personally offended by such speeches. After all, it is for us and\r\nnot for others to make us great.”\r\n\r\n“You are appointed, dear,” cried Celestine, pressing her husband’s hand\r\nas they drove away. “If it had not been for des Lupeaulx I should have\r\nexplained your scheme to his Excellency. But I will do it next Tuesday,\r\nand it will help the further matter of making you Master of petitions.”\r\n\r\nIn the life of every woman there comes a day when she shines in all\r\nher glory; a day which gives her an unfading recollection to which she\r\nrecurs with happiness all her life. As Madame Rabourdin took off one by\r\none the ornaments of her apparel, she thought over the events of this\r\nevening, and marked the day among the triumphs and glories of her\r\nlife,--all her beauties had been seen and envied, she had been praised\r\nand flattered by the minister’s wife, delighted thus to make the other\r\nwomen jealous of her; but, above all, her grace and vanities had shone\r\nto the profit of conjugal love. Her husband was appointed.\r\n\r\n“Did you think I looked well to-night?” she said to him, joyously.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant Mitral, waiting at the Cafe Themis, saw the two\r\nusurers returning, but was unable to perceive the slightest indications\r\nof the result on their impassible faces.\r\n\r\n“What of it?” he said, when they were all seated at table.\r\n\r\n“Same as ever,” replied Gigonnet, rubbing his hands, “victory with\r\ngold.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Gobseck.\r\n\r\nMitral took a cabriolet and went straight to the Saillards and\r\nBaudoyers, who were still playing boston at a late hour. No one was\r\npresent but the Abbe Gaudron. Falleix, half-dead with the fatigue of his\r\njourney, had gone to bed.\r\n\r\n“You will be appointed, nephew,” said Mitral; “and there’s a surprise in\r\nstore for you.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Saillard.\r\n\r\n“The cross of the Legion of honor?” cried Mitral.\r\n\r\n“God protects those who guard his altars,” said Gaudron.\r\n\r\nThus the Te Deum was sung with equal joy and confidence in both camps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. FORWARD, MOLLUSKS!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, Wednesday, Monsieur Rabourdin was to transact business\r\nwith the minister, for he had filled the late La Billardiere’s place\r\nsince the beginning of the latter’s illness. On such days the clerks\r\ncame punctually, the servants were specially attentive, there was always\r\na certain excitement in the offices on these signing-days,--and why,\r\nnobody ever knew. On this occasion the three servants were at their\r\npost, flattering themselves they should get a few fees; for a rumor of\r\nRabourdin’s nomination had spread through the ministry the night before,\r\nthanks to Dutocq. Uncle Antoine and Laurent had donned their full\r\nuniform, when, at a quarter to eight, des Lupeaulx’s servant came in\r\nwith a letter, which he begged Antoine to give secretly to Dutocq,\r\nsaying that the general-secretary had ordered him to deliver it without\r\nfail at Monsieur Dutocq’s house by seven o’clock.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I don’t know how it happened,” he said, “but I overslept\r\nmyself. I’ve only just waked up, and he’d play the devil’s tattoo on me\r\nif he knew the letter hadn’t gone. I know a famous secret, Antoine; but\r\ndon’t say anything about it to the clerks if I tell you; promise? He\r\nwould send me off if he knew I had said a single word; he told me so.”\r\n\r\n“What’s inside the letter?” asked Antoine, eying it.\r\n\r\n“Nothing; I looked this way--see.”\r\n\r\nHe made the letter gape open, and showed Antoine that there was nothing\r\nbut blank paper to be seen.\r\n\r\n“This is going to be a great day for you, Laurent,” went on the\r\nsecretary’s man. “You are to have a new director. Economy must be the\r\norder of the day, for they are going to unite the two divisions under\r\none director--you fellows will have to look out!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, nine clerks are put on the retired list,” said Dutocq, who came in\r\nat the moment; “how did you hear that?”\r\n\r\nAntoine gave him the letter, and he had no sooner opened it than he\r\nrushed headlong downstairs in the direction of the secretary’s office.\r\n\r\nThe bureaus Rabourdin and Baudoyer, after idling and gossiping since\r\nthe death of Monsieur de la Billardiere, were now recovering their usual\r\nofficial look and the dolce far niente habits of a government office.\r\nNevertheless, the approaching end of the year did cause rather more\r\napplication among the clerks, just as porters and servants become at\r\nthat season more unctuously civil. They all came punctually, for one\r\nthing; more remained after four o’clock than was usual at other times.\r\nIt was not forgotten that fees and gratuities depend on the last\r\nimpressions made upon the minds of masters. The news of the union of the\r\ntwo divisions, that of La Billardiere and that of Clergeot, under one\r\ndirector, had spread through the various offices. The number of the\r\nclerks to be retired was known, but all were in ignorance of the names.\r\nIt was taken for granted that Poiret would not be replaced, and that\r\nwould be a retrenchment. Little La Billardiere had already departed.\r\nTwo new supernumeraries had made their appearance, and, alarming\r\ncircumstance! they were both sons of deputies. The news told about\r\nin the offices the night before, just as the clerks were dispersing,\r\nagitated all minds, and for the first half-hour after arrival in the\r\nmorning they stood around the stoves and talked it over. But earlier\r\nthan that, Dutocq, as we have seen, had rushed to des Lupeaulx on\r\nreceiving his note, and found him dressing. Without laying down his\r\nrazor, the general-secretary cast upon his subordinate the glance of a\r\ngeneral issuing an order.\r\n\r\n“Are we alone?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. March on Rabourdin; forward! steady! Of course you kept a\r\ncopy of that paper?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You understand me? Inde iroe! There must be a general hue and cry\r\nraised against him. Find some way to start a clamor--”\r\n\r\n“I could get a man to make a caricature, but I haven’t five hundred\r\nfrancs to pay for it.”\r\n\r\n“Who would make it?”\r\n\r\n“Bixou.”\r\n\r\n“He shall have a thousand and be under-head-clerk to Colleville, who\r\nwill arrange with them; tell him so.”\r\n\r\n“But he wouldn’t believe it on nothing more than my word.”\r\n\r\n“Are you trying to make me compromise myself? Either do the thing or let\r\nit alone; do you hear me?”\r\n\r\n“If Monsieur Baudoyer were director--”\r\n\r\n“Well, he will be. Go now, and make haste; you have no time to lose.\r\nGo down the back-stairs; I don’t want people to know you have just seen\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nWhile Dutocq was returning to the clerks’ office and asking himself how\r\nhe could best incite a clamor against his chief without compromising\r\nhimself, Bixiou rushed to the Rabourdin office for a word of greeting.\r\nBelieving that he had lost his bet the incorrigible joker thought it\r\namusing to pretend that he had won it.\r\n\r\nBixiou [mimicking Phellion’s voice]. “Gentlemen, I salute you with a\r\ncollective how d’ye do, and I appoint Sunday next for the dinner at\r\nthe Rocher de Cancale. But a serious question presents itself. Is that\r\ndinner to include the clerks who are dismissed?”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “And those who retire?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Not that I care, for it isn’t I who pay.” [General\r\nstupefaction.] “Baudoyer is appointed. I think I already hear him\r\ncalling Laurent” [mimicking Baudoyer], “Laurent! lock up my hair-shirt,\r\nand my scourge.” [They all roar with laughter.] “Yes, yes, he laughs\r\nwell who laughs last. Gentlemen, there’s a great deal in that anagram of\r\nColleville’s. ‘Xavier Rabourdin, chef de bureau--D’abord reva bureaux,\r\ne-u fin riche.’ If I were named ‘Charles X., par la grace de Dieu roi\r\nde France et de Navarre,’ I should tremble in my shoes at the fate those\r\nletters anagrammatize.”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “Look here! are you making fun?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “No, I am not. Rabourdin resigns in a rage at finding Baudoyer\r\nappointed director.”\r\n\r\nVimeux [entering.] “Nonsense, no such thing! Antoine (to whom I have\r\njust been paying forty francs that I owed him) tells me that Monsieur\r\nand Madame Rabourdin were at the minister’s private party last night and\r\nstayed till midnight. His Excellency escorted Madame Rabourdin to the\r\nstaircase. It seems she was divinely dressed. In short, it is quite\r\ncertain that Rabourdin is to be director. Riffe, the secretary’s copying\r\nclerk, told me he sat up all the night before to draw the papers; it is\r\nno longer a secret. Monsieur Clergeot is retired. After thirty years’\r\nservice that’s no misfortune. Monsieur Cochlin, who is rich--”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “By cochineal.”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “Yes, cochineal; he’s a partner in the house of Matifat, rue des\r\nLombards. Well, he is retired; so is Poiret. Neither is to be replaced.\r\nSo much is certain; the rest is all conjecture. The appointment of\r\nMonsieur Rabourdin is to be announced this morning; they are afraid of\r\nintrigues.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “What intrigues?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Baudoyer’s, confound him! The priests uphold him; here’s\r\nanother article in the liberal journal,--only half a dozen lines, but\r\nthey are queer” [reads]:\r\n\r\n  “Certain persons spoke last night in the lobby of the Opera-house\r\n  of the return of Monsieur de Chateaubriand to the ministry, basing\r\n  their opinion on the choice made of Monsieur Rabourdin (the\r\n  protege of friends of the noble viscount) to fill the office for\r\n  which Monsieur Baudoyer was first selected. The clerical party is\r\n  not likely to withdraw unless in deference to the great writer.\r\n\r\n“Blackguards!”\r\n\r\nDutocq [entering, having heard the whole discussion]. “Blackguards! Who?\r\nRabourdin? Then you know the news?”\r\n\r\nFleury [rolling his eyes savagely]. “Rabourdin a blackguard! Are you\r\nmad, Dutocq? do you want a ball in your brains to give them weight?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “I said nothing against Monsieur Rabourdin; only it has just\r\nbeen told to me in confidence that he has written a paper denouncing all\r\nthe clerks and officials, and full of facts about their lives; in short,\r\nthe reason why his friends support him is because he has written this\r\npaper against the administration, in which we are all exposed--”\r\n\r\nPhellion [in a loud voice]. “Monsieur Rabourdin is incapable of--”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Very proper in you to say so. Tell me, Dutocq” [they whisper\r\ntogether and then go into the corridor].\r\n\r\nBixiou. “What has happened?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Do you remember what I said to you about that caricature?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Yes, what then?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Make it, and you shall be under-head-clerk with a famous fee.\r\nThe fact is, my dear fellow, there’s dissension among the powers that\r\nbe. The minister is pledged to Rabourdin, but if he doesn’t appoint\r\nBaudoyer he offends the priests and their party. You see, the King, the\r\nDauphin and the Dauphine, the clergy, and lastly the court, all want\r\nBaudoyer; the minister wants Rabourdin.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Good!”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “To ease the matter off, the minister, who sees he must give\r\nway, wants to strangle the difficulty. We must find some good reason for\r\ngetting rid of Rabourdin. Now somebody has lately unearthed a paper of\r\nhis, exposing the present system of administration and wanting to\r\nreform it; and that paper is going the rounds,--at least, this is how I\r\nunderstand the matter. Make the drawing we talked of; in so doing you’ll\r\nplay the game of all the big people, and help the minister, the court,\r\nthe clergy,--in short, everybody; and you’ll get your appointment. Now\r\ndo you understand me?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “I don’t understand how you came to know all that; perhaps you\r\nare inventing it.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Do you want me to let you see what Rabourdin wrote about you?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Yes.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Then come home with me; for I must put the document into safe\r\nkeeping.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “You go first alone.” [Re-enters the bureau Rabourdin.] “What\r\nDutocq told you is really all true, word of honor! It seems that\r\nMonsieur Rabourdin has written and sent in very unflattering\r\ndescriptions of the clerks whom he wants to ‘reform.’ That’s the real\r\nreason why his secret friends wish him appointed. Well, well; we live in\r\ndays when nothing astonishes me” [flings his cloak about him like Talma,\r\nand declaims]:--\r\n\r\n  “Thou who has seen the fall of grand, illustrious heads,\r\n  Why thus amazed, insensate that thou art,\r\n\r\nto find a man like Rabourdin employing such means? Baudoyer is too much\r\nof a fool to know how to use them. Accept my congratulations, gentlemen;\r\neither way you are under a most illustrious chief” [goes off].\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I shall leave this ministry without ever comprehending a single\r\nword that gentleman utters. What does he mean with his ‘heads that\r\nfall’?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “‘Heads that fell?’ why, think of the four sergeants of\r\nRochelle, Ney, Berton, Caron, the brothers Faucher, and the massacres.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “He asserts very flippantly things that he only guesses at.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Say at once that he lies; in his mouth truth itself turns to\r\ncorrosion.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Your language is unparliamentary and lacks the courtesy and\r\nconsideration which are due to a colleague.”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “It seems to me that if what he says is false, the proper\r\nname for it is calumny, defamation of character; and such a slanderer\r\ndeserves the thrashing.”\r\n\r\nFleury [getting hot]. “If the government offices are public places, the\r\nmatter ought to be taken into the police-courts.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [wishing to avert a quarrel, tries to turn the conversation].\r\n“Gentleman, might I ask you to keep quiet? I am writing a little\r\ntreatise on moral philosophy, and I am just at the heart of it.”\r\n\r\nFleury [interrupting]. “What are you saying about it, Monsieur\r\nPhellion?”\r\n\r\nPhellion [reading]. “Question.--What is the soul of man?\r\n\r\n“Answer.--A spiritual substance which thinks and reasons.”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “Spiritual substance! you might as well talk about immaterial\r\nstone.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Don’t interrupt; let him go on.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [continuing]. “Quest.--Whence comes the soul?\r\n\r\n“Ans.--From God, who created it of a nature one and indivisible; the\r\ndestructibility thereof is, consequently, not conceivable, and he hath\r\nsaid--”\r\n\r\nPoiret [amazed]. “God said?”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Yes, monsieur; tradition authorizes the statement.”\r\n\r\nFleury [to Poiret]. “Come, don’t interrupt, yourself.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [resuming]. “--and he hath said that he created it immortal; in\r\nother words, the soul can never die.\r\n\r\n“Quest.--What are the uses of the soul?\r\n\r\n“Ans.--To comprehend, to will, to remember; these constitute\r\nunderstanding, volition, memory.\r\n\r\n“Quest.--What are the uses of the understanding?\r\n\r\n“Ans.--To know. It is the eye of the soul.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “And the soul is the eye of what?”\r\n\r\nPhellion [continuing]. “Quest.--What ought the understanding to know?\r\n\r\n“Ans.--Truth.\r\n\r\n“Quest.--Why does man possess volition?\r\n\r\n“Ans.--To love good and hate evil.\r\n\r\n“Quest.--What is good?\r\n\r\n“Ans.--That which makes us happy.”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “Heavens! do you teach that to young ladies?”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Yes” [continuing]. “Quest.--How many kinds of good are\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Amazingly indecorous, to say the least.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [aggrieved]. “Oh, monsieur!” [Controlling himself.] “But here’s\r\nthe answer,--that’s as far as I have got” [reads]:--\r\n\r\n“Ans.--There are two kinds of good,--eternal good and temporal good.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [with a look of contempt]. “And does that sell for anything?”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “I hope it will. It requires great application of mind to\r\ncarry on a system of questions and answers; that is why I ask you to be\r\nquiet and let me think, for the answers--”\r\n\r\nThuillier [interrupting]. “The answers might be sold separately.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Is that a pun?”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “No; a riddle.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “I am sorry I interrupted you” [he dives into his office\r\ndesk]. “But” [to himself] “at any rate, I have stopped their talking\r\nabout Monsieur Rabourdin.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a scene was taking place between the minister and des\r\nLupeaulx which decided Rabourdin’s fate. The general-secretary had gone\r\nto see the minister in his private study before the breakfast-hour, to\r\nmake sure that La Briere was not within hearing.\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency is not treating me frankly--”\r\n\r\n“He means a quarrel,” thought the minister; “and all because his\r\nmistress coquetted with me last night. I did not think you so juvenile,\r\nmy dear friend,” he said aloud.\r\n\r\n“Friend?” said the general-secretary, “that is what I want to find out.”\r\n\r\nThe minister looked haughtily at des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“We are alone,” continued the secretary, “and we can come to an\r\nunderstanding. The deputy of the arrondissement in which my estate is\r\nsituated--”\r\n\r\n“So it is really an estate!” said the minister, laughing, to hide his\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“Increased by a recent purchase of two hundred thousand francs’ worth of\r\nadjacent property,” replied des Lupeaulx, carelessly. “You knew of the\r\ndeputy’s approaching resignation at least ten days ago, and you did not\r\ntell me of it. You were perhaps not bound to do so, but you knew very\r\nwell that I am most anxious to take my seat in the centre. Has\r\nit occurred to you that I might fling myself back on the\r\n‘Doctrine’?--which, let me tell you, will destroy the administration and\r\nthe monarchy both if you continue to allow the party of representative\r\ngovernment to be recruited from men of talent whom you ignore. Don’t you\r\nknow that in every nation there are fifty to sixty, not more, dangerous\r\nheads, whose schemes are in proportion to their ambition? The secret of\r\nknowing how to govern is to know those heads well, and either to chop\r\nthem off or buy them. I don’t know how much talent I have, but I know\r\nthat I have ambition; and you are committing a serious blunder when you\r\nset aside a man who wishes you well. The anointed head dazzles for the\r\ntime being, but what next?--Why, a war of words; discussions will spring\r\nup once more and grow embittered, envenomed. Then, for your own sake, I\r\nadvise you not to find me at the Left Centre. In spite of your\r\nprefect’s manoeuvres (instructions for which no doubt went from here\r\nconfidentially) I am secure of a majority. The time has come for you and\r\nme to understand each other. After a breeze like this people sometimes\r\nbecome closer friends than ever. I must be made count and receive the\r\ngrand cordon of the Legion of honor as a reward for my public services.\r\nHowever, I care less for those things just now than I do for something\r\nelse in which you are more personally concerned. You have not yet\r\nappointed Rabourdin, and I have news this morning which tends to show\r\nthat most persons will be better satisfied if you appoint Baudoyer.”\r\n\r\n“Appoint Baudoyer!” echoed the minister. “Do you know him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said des Lupeaulx; “but suppose he proves incapable, as he will,\r\nyou can then get rid of him by asking those who protect him to employ\r\nhim elsewhere. You will thus get back an important office to give\r\nto friends; it may come in at the right moment to facilitate some\r\ncompromise.”\r\n\r\n“But I have pledged it to Rabourdin.”\r\n\r\n“That may be; and I don’t ask you to make the change this very day.\r\nI know the danger of saying yes and no within twenty-four hours. But\r\npostpone the appointment, and don’t sign the papers till the day\r\nafter to-morrow; by that time you may find it impossible to retain\r\nRabourdin,--in fact, in all probability, he will send you his\r\nresignation--”\r\n\r\n“His resignation?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“He is the tool of a secret power in whose interests he has carried on\r\na system of espionage in all the ministries, and the thing has been\r\ndiscovered by mere accident. He has written a paper of some kind, giving\r\nshort histories of all the officials. Everybody is talking of it; the\r\nclerks are furious. For heaven’s sake, don’t transact business with him\r\nto-day; let me find some means for you to avoid it. Ask an audience\r\nof the King; I am sure you will find great satisfaction there if you\r\nconcede the point about Baudoyer; and you can obtain something as an\r\nequivalent. Your position will be better than ever if you are forced\r\nlater to dismiss a fool whom the court party impose upon you.”\r\n\r\n“What has made you turn against Rabourdin?”\r\n\r\n“Would you forgive Monsieur de Chateaubriand for writing an article\r\nagainst the ministry? Well, read that, and see how Rabourdin has treated\r\nme in his secret document,” said des Lupeaulx, giving the paper to the\r\nminister. “He pretends to reorganize the government from beginning to\r\nend,--no doubt in the interests of some secret society of which, as\r\nyet, we know nothing. I shall continue to be his friend for the sake\r\nof watching him; by that means I may render the government such signal\r\nservice that they will have to make me count; for the peerage is the\r\nonly thing I really care for. I want you fully to understand that I am\r\nnot seeking office or anything else that would cause me to stand in your\r\nway; I am simply aiming for the peerage, which will enable me to marry a\r\nbanker’s daughter with an income of a couple of hundred thousand francs.\r\nAnd so, allow me to render you a few signal services which will make the\r\nKing feel that I have saved the throne. I have long said that Liberalism\r\nwould never offer us a pitched battle. It has given up conspiracies,\r\nCarbonaroism, and revolts with weapons; it is now sapping and mining,\r\nand the day is coming when it will be able to say, ‘Out of that and let\r\nme in!’ Do you think I have been courting Rabourdin’s wife for my own\r\npleasure? No, but I got much information from her. So now, let us agree\r\non two things; first, the postponement of the appointment; second,\r\nyour /sincere/ support of my election. You shall find at the end of the\r\nsession that I have amply repaid you.”\r\n\r\nFor all answer, the minister took the appointment papers and placed them\r\nin des Lupeaulx’s hand.\r\n\r\n“I will go and tell Rabourdin,” added des Lupeaulx, “that you cannot\r\ntransact business with him till Saturday.”\r\n\r\nThe minister replied with an assenting gesture. The secretary despatched\r\nhis man with a message to Rabourdin that the minister could not work\r\nwith him until Saturday, on which day the Chamber was occupied with\r\nprivate bills, and his Excellency had more time at his disposal.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment Saillard, having brought the monthly stipend, was\r\nslipping his little speech into the ear of the minister’s wife, who\r\ndrew herself up and answered with dignity that she did not meddle in\r\npolitical matters, and besides, she had heard that Monsieur Rabourdin\r\nwas already appointed. Saillard, terrified, rushed up to Baudoyer’s\r\noffice, where he found Dutocq, Godard, and Bixiou in a state of\r\nexasperation difficult to describe; for they were reading the terrible\r\npaper on the administration in which they were all discussed.\r\n\r\nBixiou [with his finger on a paragraph]. “Here /you/ are, pere Saillard.\r\nListen” [reads]:--\r\n\r\n“Saillard.--The office of cashier to be suppressed in all the\r\nministries; their accounts to be kept in future at the Treasury.\r\nSaillard is rich and does not need a pension.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to hear about your son-in-law?” [Turns over the leaves.]\r\n“Here he is” [reads]:--\r\n\r\n“Baudoyer.--Utterly incapable. To be thanked and dismissed. Rich; does\r\nnot need a pension.\r\n\r\n“And here’s for Godard” [reads]:--\r\n\r\n“Godard.--Should be dismissed; pension one-third of his present salary.\r\n\r\n“In short, here we all are. Listen to what I am” [reads]: “An artist\r\nwho might be employed by the civil list, at the Opera, or the\r\nMenus-Plaisirs, or the Museum. Great deal of capacity, little\r\nself-respect, no application,--a restless spirit. Ha! I’ll give you a\r\ntouch of the artist, Monsieur Rabourdin!”\r\n\r\nSaillard. “Suppress cashiers! Why, the man’s a monster?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Let us see what he says of our mysterious Desroys.” [Turns over\r\nthe pages; reads.]\r\n\r\n“Desroys.--Dangerous; because he cannot be shaken in principles that are\r\nsubversive of monarchial power. He is the son of the Conventionel, and\r\nhe admires the Convention. He may become a very mischievous journalist.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer. “The police are not worse spies!”\r\n\r\nGodard. “I shall go the general-secretary and lay a complaint in form;\r\nwe must all resign in a body if such a man as that is put over us.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Gentlemen, listen to me; let us be prudent. If you rise at\r\nonce in a body, we may all be accused of rancor and revenge. No, let\r\nthe thing work, let the rumor spread quietly. When the whole ministry is\r\naroused your remonstrances will meet with general approval.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Dutocq believes in the principles of the grand air composed by\r\nthe sublime Rossini for Basilio,--which goes to show, by the bye, that\r\nthe great composer was also a great politician. I shall leave my card\r\non Monsieur Rabourdin to-morrow morning, inscribed thus: ‘Bixiou; no\r\nself-respect, no application, restless mind.’”\r\n\r\nGodard. “A good idea, gentlemen. Let us all leave our cards to-morrow on\r\nRabourdin inscribed in the same way.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [leading Bixiou apart]. “Come, you’ll agree to make that\r\ncaricature now, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “I see plainly, my dear fellow, that you knew all about\r\nthis affair ten days ago” [looks him in the eye]. “Am I to be\r\nunder-head-clerk?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “On my word of honor, yes, and a thousand-franc fee beside,\r\njust as I told you. You don’t know what a service you’ll be rendering to\r\npowerful personages.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “You know them?”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Yes.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Well, then I want to speak with them.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [dryly]. “You can make the caricature or not, and you can be\r\nunder-head-clerk or not,--as you please.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “At any rate, let me see that thousand francs.”\r\n\r\nDutocq. “You shall have them when you bring the drawing.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Forward, march! that lampoon shall go from end to end of the\r\nbureaus to-morrow morning. Let us go and torment the Rabourdins.” [Then\r\nspeaking to Saillard, Godard, and Baudoyer, who were talking together in\r\na low voice.] “We are going to stir up the neighbors.” [Goes with Dutocq\r\ninto the Rabourdin bureau. Fleury, Thuillier, and Vimeux are there,\r\ntalking excitedly.] “What’s the matter, gentlemen? All that I told you\r\nturns out to be true; you can go and see for yourselves the work of\r\nthis infamous informer; for it is in the hands of the virtuous, honest,\r\nestimable, upright, and pious Baudoyer, who is indeed utterly incapable\r\nof doing any such thing. Your chief has got every one of you under the\r\nguillotine. Go and see; follow the crowd; money returned if you are not\r\nsatisfied; execution /gratis/! The appointments are postponed. All the\r\nbureaus are in arms; Rabourdin has been informed that the minister will\r\nnot work with him. Come, be off; go and see for yourselves.”\r\n\r\nThey all depart except Phellion and Poiret, who are left alone. The\r\nformer loved Rabourdin too well to look for proof that might injure a\r\nman he was determined not to judge; the other had only five days more to\r\nremain in the office, and cared nothing either way. Just then Sebastien\r\ncame down to collect the papers for signature. He was a good deal\r\nsurprised, though he did not show it, to find the office deserted.\r\n\r\nPhellion. “My young friend” [he rose, a rare thing], “do you know what\r\nis going on? what scandals are rife about Monsieur Rabourdin whom you\r\nlove, and” [bending to whisper in Sebastien’s ear] “whom I love as much\r\nas I respect him. They say he has committed the imprudence to leave a\r\npaper containing comments on the officials lying about in the office--”\r\n [Phellion stopped short, caught the young man in his strong arms, seeing\r\nthat he turned pale and was near fainting, and placed him on a chair.]\r\n“A key, Monsieur Poiret, to put down his back; have you a key?”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I have the key of my domicile.”\r\n\r\n[Old Poiret junior promptly inserted the said key between Sebastien’s\r\nshoulders, while Phellion gave him some water to drink. The poor lad\r\nno sooner opened his eyes than he began to weep. He laid his head on\r\nPhellion’s desk, and all his limbs were limp as if struck by lightning;\r\nwhile his sobs were so heartrending, so genuine, that for the first\r\ntime in his life Poiret’s feelings were stirred by the sufferings of\r\nanother.]\r\n\r\nPhellion [speaking firmly]. “Come, come, my young friend; courage! In\r\ntimes of trial we must show courage. You are a man. What is the matter?\r\nWhat has happened to distress you so terribly?”\r\n\r\nSebastien [sobbing]. “It is I who have ruined Monsieur Rabourdin. I left\r\nthat paper lying about when I copied it. I have killed my benefactor; I\r\nshall die myself. Such a noble man!--a man who ought to be minister!”\r\n\r\nPoiret [blowing his nose]. “Then it is true he wrote the report.”\r\n\r\nSebastien [still sobbing]. “But it was to--there, I was going to tell\r\nhis secrets! Ah! that wretch of a Dutocq; it was he who stole the\r\npaper.”\r\n\r\nHis tears and sobs recommenced and made so much noise that Rabourdin\r\ncame up to see what was the matter. He found the young fellow almost\r\nfainting in the arms of Poiret and Phellion.\r\n\r\nRabourdin. “What is the matter, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\nSebastien [struggling to his feet, and then falling on his knees before\r\nRabourdin]. “I have ruined you, monsieur. That memorandum,--Dutocq, the\r\nmonster, he must have taken it.”\r\n\r\nRabourdin [calmly]. “I knew that already” [he lifts Sebastien]. “You are\r\na child, my young friend.” [Speaks to Phellion.] “Where are the other\r\ngentlemen?”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “They have gone into Monsieur Baudoyer’s office to see a paper\r\nwhich it is said--”\r\n\r\nRabourdin [interrupting him]. “Enough.” [Goes out, taking Sebastien with\r\nhim. Poiret and Phellion look at each other in amazement, and do not\r\nknow what to say.]\r\n\r\nPoiret [to Phellion]. “Monsieur Rabourdin--”\r\n\r\nPhellion [to Poiret]. “Monsieur Rabourdin--”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Well, I never! Monsieur Rabourdin!”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “But did you notice how calm and dignified he was?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [with a sly look that was more like a grimace]. “I shouldn’t be\r\nsurprised if there were something under it all.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “A man of honor; pure and spotless.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Who is?”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Monsieur Poiret, you think as I think about Dutocq; surely\r\nyou understand me?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [nodding his head three times and answering with a shrewd look].\r\n“Yes.” [The other clerks return.]\r\n\r\nFleury. “A great shock; I still don’t believe the thing. Monsieur\r\nRabourdin, a king among men! If such men are spies, it is enough to\r\ndisgust one with virtue. I have always put Rabourdin among Plutarch’s\r\nheroes.”\r\n\r\nVimeux. “It is all true.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [reflecting that he had only five days more to stay in the\r\noffice]. “But, gentlemen, what do you say about the man who stole that\r\npaper, who spied upon Rabourdin?” [Dutocq left the room.]\r\n\r\nFleury. “I say he is a Judas Iscariot. Who is he?”\r\n\r\nPhellion [significantly]. “He is not here at /this moment/.”\r\n\r\nVimeux [enlightened]. “It is Dutocq!”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “I have no proof of it, gentlemen. While you were gone, that\r\nyoung man, Monsieur de la Roche, nearly fainted here. See his tears on\r\nmy desk!”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “We held him fainting in our arms.--My key, the key of my\r\ndomicile!--dear, dear! it is down his back.” [Poiret goes hastily out.]\r\n\r\nVimeux. “The minister refused to transact business with Rabourdin\r\nto-day; and Monsieur Saillard, to whom the secretary said a few words,\r\ncame to tell Monsieur Baudoyer to apply for the cross of the Legion of\r\nhonor,--there is one to be granted, you know, on New-Year’s day, to all\r\nthe heads of divisions. It is quite clear what it all means. Monsieur\r\nRabourdin is sacrificed by the very persons who employed him. Bixiou\r\nsays so. We were all to be turned out, except Sebastien and Phellion.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [entering]. “Well, gentlemen, is it true?”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “To the last word.”\r\n\r\nDu Bruel [putting his hat on again]. “Good-bye.” [Hurries out.]\r\n\r\nThuillier. “He may rush as much as he pleases to his Duc de Rhetore\r\nand Duc de Maufrigneuse, but Colleville is to be our under-head-clerk,\r\nthat’s certain.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Du Bruel always seemed to be attached to Monsieur Rabourdin.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [returning]. “I have had a world of trouble to get back my key.\r\nThat boy is crying still, and Monsieur Rabourdin has disappeared.”\r\n [Dutocq and Bixiou enter.]\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Ha, gentlemen! strange things are going on in your bureau. Du\r\nBruel! I want you.” [Looks into the adjoining room.] “Gone?”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “Full speed.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “What about Rabourdin?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “Distilled, evaporated, melted! Such a man, the king of men,\r\nthat he--”\r\n\r\nPoiret [to Dutocq]. “That little Sebastien, in his trouble, said that\r\nyou, Monsieur Dutocq, had taken the paper from him ten days ago.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [looking at Dutocq]. “You must clear yourself of /that/, my good\r\nfriend.” [All the clerks look fixedly at Dutocq.]\r\n\r\nDutocq. “Where’s the little viper who copied it?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Copied it? How did you know he copied it? Ha! ha! it is only\r\nthe diamond that cuts the diamond.” [Dutocq leaves the room.]\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Would you listen to me, Monsieur Bixiou? I have only five days\r\nand a half to stay in this office, and I do wish that once, only once, I\r\nmight have the pleasure of understanding what you mean. Do me the honor\r\nto explain what diamonds have to do with these present circumstances.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “I meant papa,--for I’m willing for once to bring my intellect\r\ndown to the level of yours,--that just as the diamond alone can cut\r\nthe diamond, so it is only one inquisitive man who can defeat another\r\ninquisitive man.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “‘Inquisitive man’ stands for ‘spy.’”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Very well; try again some other time.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rabourdin, after taking Sebastien to his room, had gone\r\nstraight to the minister; but the minister was at the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. Rabourdin went at once to the Chamber, where he wrote a note\r\nto his Excellency, who was at that moment in the tribune engaged in a\r\nhot discussion. Rabourdin waited, not in the conference hall, but in\r\nthe courtyard, where, in spite of the cold, he resolved to remain and\r\nintercept his Excellency as he got into his carriage. The usher of the\r\nChamber had told him that the minister was in the thick of a controversy\r\nraised by the nineteen members of the extreme Left, and that the session\r\nwas likely to be stormy. Rabourdin walked to and for in the courtyard\r\nof the palace for five mortal hours, a prey to feverish agitation. At\r\nhalf-past six o’clock the session broke up, and the members filed out.\r\nThe minister’s chasseur came up to find the coachman.\r\n\r\n“Hi, Jean!” he called out to him; “Monseigneur has gone with the\r\nminister of war; they are going to see the King, and after that they\r\ndine together, and we are to fetch him at ten o’clock. There’s a Council\r\nthis evening.”\r\n\r\nRabourdin walked slowly home, in a state of despondency not difficult to\r\nimagine. It was seven o’clock, and he had barely time to dress.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are appointed?” cried his wife, joyously, as he entered the\r\nsalon.\r\n\r\nRabourdin raised his head with a grievous motion of distress and\r\nanswered, “I fear I shall never again set foot in the ministry.”\r\n\r\n“What?” said his wife, quivering with sudden anxiety.\r\n\r\n“My memorandum on the officials is known in all the offices; and I have\r\nnot been able to see the minister.”\r\n\r\nCelestine’s eyes were opened to a sudden vision in which the devil,\r\nin one of his infernal flashes, showed her the meaning of her last\r\nconversation with des Lupeaulx.\r\n\r\n“If I had behaved like a low woman,” she thought, “we should have had\r\nthe place.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at Rabourdin with grief in her heart. A sad silence fell\r\nbetween them, and dinner was eaten in the midst of gloomy meditations.\r\n\r\n“And it is my Wednesday,” she said at last.\r\n\r\n“All is not lost, dear Celestine,” said Rabourdin, laying a kiss on his\r\nwife’s forehead; “perhaps to-morrow I shall be able to see the minister\r\nand explain everything. Sebastien sat up all last night to finish the\r\nwriting; the papers are copied and collated; I shall place them on the\r\nminister’s desk and beg him to read them through. La Briere will help\r\nme. A man is never condemned without a hearing.”\r\n\r\n“I am curious to see if Monsieur des Lupeaulx will come here to-night.”\r\n\r\n“He? Of course he will come,” said Rabourdin; “there’s something of the\r\ntiger in him; he likes to lick the blood of the wounds he has given.”\r\n\r\n“My poor husband,” said his wife, taking his hand, “I don’t see how it\r\nis that a man who could conceive so noble a reform did not also see that\r\nit ought not to be communicated to a single person. It is one of those\r\nideas that a man should keep in his own mind, for he alone can apply\r\nthem. A statesman must do in our political sphere as Napoleon did in\r\nhis; he stooped, twisted, crawled. Yes, Bonaparte crawled! To be made\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Army of Italy he married Barrere’s mistress.\r\nYou should have waited, got yourself elected deputy, followed the\r\npolitics of a party, sometimes down in the depths, at other times on the\r\ncrest of the wave, and you should have taken, like Monsieur de Villele,\r\nthe Italian motto ‘Col tempo,’ in other words, ‘All things are given to\r\nhim who knows how to wait.’ That great orator worked for seven years to\r\nget into power; he began in 1814 by protesting against the Charter\r\nwhen he was the same age that you are now. Here’s your fault; you have\r\nallowed yourself to be kept subordinate, when you were born to rule.”\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the painter Schinner imposed silence on the wife and\r\nhusband, but these words made the latter thoughtful.\r\n\r\n“Dear friend,” said the painter, grasping Rabourdin’s hand, “the\r\nsupport of artists is a useless thing enough, but let me say under these\r\ncircumstances that we are all faithful to you. I have just read the\r\nevening papers. Baudoyer is appointed director and receives the cross of\r\nthe Legion of honor--”\r\n\r\n“I have been longer in the department, I have served twenty-four hours,”\r\n said Rabourdin with a smile.\r\n\r\n“I know Monsieur le Comte de Serizy, the minister of State, pretty well,\r\nand if he can help you, I will go and see him,” said Schinner.\r\n\r\nThe salon soon filled with persons who knew nothing of the government\r\nproceedings. Du Bruel did not appear. Madame Rabourdin was gayer and\r\nmore graceful than ever, like the charger wounded in battle, that still\r\nfinds strength to carry his master from the field.\r\n\r\n“She is very courageous,” said a few women who knew the truth, and who\r\nwere charmingly attentive to her, understanding her misfortunes.\r\n\r\n“But she certainly did a great deal to attract des Lupeaulx,” said the\r\nBaronne du Chatelet to the Vicomtesse de Fontaine.\r\n\r\n“Do you think--” began the vicomtesse.\r\n\r\n“If so,” interrupted Madame de Camps, in defence of her friend,\r\n“Monsieur Rabourdin would at least have had the cross.”\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock des Lupeaulx appeared; and we can only describe him\r\nby saying that his spectacles were sad and his eyes joyous; the glasses,\r\nhowever, obscured the glances so successfully that only a physiognomist\r\nwould have seen the diabolical expression which they wore. He went up to\r\nRabourdin and pressed the hand which the latter could not avoid giving\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen he approached Madame Rabourdin.\r\n\r\n“We have much to say to each other,” he remarked as he seated himself\r\nbeside the beautiful woman, who received him admirably.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he continued, giving her a side glance, “you are grand indeed; I\r\nfind you just what I expected, glorious under defeat. Do you know that\r\nit is a very rare thing to find a superior woman who answers to the\r\nexpectations formed of her. So defeat doesn’t dishearten you? You are\r\nright; we shall triumph in the end,” he whispered in her ear. “Your fate\r\nis always in your own hands,--so long, I mean, as your ally is a man who\r\nadores you. We will hold counsel together.”\r\n\r\n“But is Baudoyer appointed?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the secretary.\r\n\r\n“Does he get the cross?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet; but he will have it later.”\r\n\r\n“Amazing!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you don’t understand political exigencies.”\r\n\r\nDuring this evening, which seemed interminable to Madame Rabourdin,\r\nanother scene was occurring in the place Royale,--one of those comedies\r\nwhich are played in seven Parisian salons whenever there is a change of\r\nministry. The Saillards’ salon was crowded. Monsieur and Madame Transon\r\narrived at eight o’clock; Madame Transon kissed Madame Baudoyer, nee\r\nSaillard. Monsieur Bataille, captain of the National Guard, came with\r\nhis wife and the curate of Saint Paul’s.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Baudoyer,” said Madame Transon. “I wish to be the first to\r\ncongratulate you; they have done justice to your talents. You have\r\nindeed earned your promotion.”\r\n\r\n“Here you are, director,” said Monsieur Transon, rubbing his hands, “and\r\nthe appointment is very flattering to this neighborhood.”\r\n\r\n“And we can truly say it came to pass without any intriguing,” said the\r\nworthy Saillard. “We are none of us political intriguers; /we/ don’t go\r\nto select parties at the ministry.”\r\n\r\nUncle Mitral rubbed his nose and grinned as he glanced at his niece\r\nElisabeth, the woman whose hand had pulled the wires, who was talking\r\nwith Gigonnet. Falleix, honest fellow, did not know what to make of the\r\nstupid blindness of Saillard and Baudoyer. Messieurs Dutocq, Bixiou, du\r\nBruel, Godard, and Colleville (the latter appointed head of the bureau)\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n“What a crew!” whispered Bixiou to du Bruel. “I could make a fine\r\ncaricature of them in the shapes of fishes,--dorys, flounders, sharks,\r\nand snappers, all dancing a saraband!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Colleville, “I come to offer you my congratulations;\r\nor rather we congratulate ourselves in having such a man placed over us;\r\nand we desire to assure you of the zeal with which we shall co-operate\r\nin your labors. Allow me to say that this event affords a signal proof\r\nto the truth of my axiom that a man’s destiny lies in the letters of his\r\nname. I may say that I knew of this appointment and of your other honors\r\nbefore I heard of them, for I spend the night in anagrammatizing\r\nyour name as follows:” [proudly] “Isidore C. T. Baudoyer,--Director,\r\ndecorated by us (his Majesty the King, of course).”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer bowed and remarked piously that names were given in baptism.\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame Baudoyer, senior, father and mother of the\r\nnew director, were there to enjoy the glory of their son and\r\ndaughter-in-law. Uncle Gigonnet-Bidault, who had dined at the house, had\r\na restless, fidgety look in his eye which frightened Bixiou.\r\n\r\n“There’s a queer one,” said the latter to du Bruel, calling his\r\nattention to Gigonnet, “who would do in a vaudeville. I wonder if he\r\ncould be bought. Such an old scarecrow is just the thing for a sign\r\nover the Two Baboons. And what a coat! I did think there was nobody\r\nbut Poiret who could show the like after that after ten years’ public\r\nexposure to the inclemencies of Parisian weather.”\r\n\r\n“Baudoyer is magnificent,” said du Bruel.\r\n\r\n“Dazzling,” answered Bixiou.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Baudoyer, “let me present you to my own uncle,\r\nMonsieur Mitral, and to my great-uncle through my wife, Monsieur\r\nBidault.”\r\n\r\nGigonnet and Mitral gave a glance at the three clerks so penetrating,\r\nso glittering with gleams of gold, that the two scoffers were sobered at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Hein?” said Bixiou, when they were safely under the arcades in the\r\nplace Royale; “did you examine those uncles?--two copies of Shylock.\r\nI’ll bet their money is lent in the market at a hundred per cent per\r\nweek. They lend on pawn; and sell most that they lay hold of, coats,\r\ngold lace, cheese, men, women, and children; they are a conglomeration\r\nof Arabs, Jews, Genoese, Genevese, Greeks, Lombards, and Parisians,\r\nsuckled by a wolf and born of a Turkish woman.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you,” said Godard. “Uncle Mitral used to be a sheriff’s\r\nofficer.”\r\n\r\n“That settles it,” said du Bruel.\r\n\r\n“I’m off to see the proof of my caricature,” said Bixiou; “but I should\r\nlike to study the state of things in Rabourdin’s salon to-night. You are\r\nlucky to be able to go there, du Bruel.”\r\n\r\n“I!” said the vaudevillist, “what should I do there? My face doesn’t\r\nlend itself to condolences. And it is very vulgar in these days to go\r\nand see people who are down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. THE RESIGNATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBy midnight Madame Rabourdin’s salon was deserted; only two or three\r\nguests remained with des Lupeaulx and the master and mistress of the\r\nhouse. When Schinner and Monsieur and Madame de Camps had likewise\r\ndeparted, des Lupeaulx rose with a mysterious air, stood with his back\r\nto the fireplace and looked alternately at the husband and wife.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” he said, “nothing is really lost, for the minister and I\r\nare faithful to you. Dutocq simply chose between two powers the one he\r\nthought strongest. He has served the court and the Grand Almoner; he\r\nhas betrayed me. But that is in the order of things; a politician never\r\ncomplains of treachery. Nevertheless, Baudoyer will be dismissed as\r\nincapable in a few months; no doubt his protectors will find him a\r\nplace,--in the prefecture of police, perhaps,--for the clergy will not\r\ndesert him.”\r\n\r\nFrom this point des Lupeaulx went on with a long tirade about the Grand\r\nAlmoner and the dangers the government ran in relying upon the\r\nchurch and upon the Jesuits. We need not, we think, point out to the\r\nintelligent reader that the court and the Grand Almoner, to whom\r\nthe liberal journals attributed an enormous influence under the\r\nadministration, had little really to do with Monsieur Baudoyer’s\r\nappointment. Such petty intrigues die in the upper sphere of great\r\nself-interests. If a few words in favor of Baudoyer were obtained by\r\nthe importunity of the curate of Saint-Paul’s and the Abbe Gaudron, they\r\nwould have been withdrawn immediately at a suggestion from the minister.\r\nThe occult power of the Congregation of Jesus (admissible certainly as\r\nconfronting the bold society of the “Doctrine,” entitled “Help yourself\r\nand heaven will help you,”) was formidable only through the imaginary\r\nforce conferred on it by subordinate powers who perpetually threatened\r\neach other with its evils. The liberal scandal-mongers delighted in\r\nrepresenting the Grand Almoner and the whole Jesuitical Chapter as\r\npolitical, administrative, civil, and military giants. Fear creates\r\nbugbears. At this crisis Baudoyer firmly believed in the said Chapter,\r\nlittle aware that the only Jesuits who had put him where he now was sat\r\nby his own fireside, and in the Cafe Themis playing dominoes.\r\n\r\nAt certain epochs in history certain powers appear, to whom all evils\r\nare attributed, though at the same time their genius is denied; they\r\nform an efficient argument in the mouth of fools. Just as Monsieur de\r\nTalleyrand was supposed to hail all events of whatever kind with a bon\r\nmot, so in these days of the Restoration the clerical party had the\r\ncredit of doing and undoing everything. Unfortunately, it did and undid\r\nnothing. Its influence was not wielded by a Cardinal Richelieu or\r\na Cardinal Mazarin; it was in the hands of a species of Cardinal\r\nde Fleury, who, timid for over five years, turned bold for one day,\r\ninjudiciously bold. Later on, the “Doctrine” did more, with impunity,\r\nat Saint-Merri, than Charles X. pretended to do in July, 1830. If the\r\nsection on the censorship so foolishly introduced into the new charter\r\nhad been omitted, journalism also would have had its Saint-Merri. The\r\nyounger Branch could have legally carried out Charles X.’s plan.\r\n\r\n“Remain where you are, head of a bureau under Baudoyer,” went on des\r\nLupeaulx. “Have the nerve to do this; make yourself a true politician;\r\nput ideas and generous impulses aside; attend only to your functions;\r\ndon’t say a word to your new director; don’t help him with a suggestion;\r\nand do nothing yourself without his order. In three months Baudoyer\r\nwill be out of the ministry, either dismissed, or stranded on some other\r\nadministrative shore. They may attach him to the king’s household.\r\nTwice in my life I have been set aside as you are, and overwhelmed by an\r\navalanche of folly; I have quietly waited and let it pass.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Rabourdin, “but you were not calumniated; your honor was not\r\nassailed, compromised--”\r\n\r\n“Ha, ha, ha!” cried des Lupeaulx, interrupting him with a burst of\r\nHomeric laughter. “Why, that’s the daily bread of every remarkable man\r\nin this glorious kingdom of France! And there are but two ways to meet\r\nsuch calumny,--either yield to it, pack up, and go plant cabbages in the\r\ncountry; or else rise above it, march on, fearless, and don’t turn your\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\n“For me, there is but one way of untying the noose which treachery and\r\nthe work of spies have fastened round my throat,” replied Rabourdin.\r\n“I must explain the matter at once to his Excellency, and if you are\r\nas sincerely attached to me as you say you are, you will put me face to\r\nface with him to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“You mean that you wish to explain to him your plan for the reform of\r\nthe service?”\r\n\r\nRabourdin bowed.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, trust the papers with me,--your memoranda, all the\r\ndocuments. I promise you that he shall sit up all night and examine\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go to him, then!” cried Rabourdin, eagerly; “six years’\r\ntoil certainly deserves two or three hours attention from the king’s\r\nminister, who will be forced to recognize, if he does not applaud, such\r\nperseverance.”\r\n\r\nCompelled by Rabourdin’s tenacity to take a straightforward path,\r\nwithout ambush or angle where his treachery could hide itself, des\r\nLupeaulx hesitated for a single instant, and looked at Madame Rabourdin,\r\nwhile he inwardly asked himself, “Which shall I permit to triumph, my\r\nhatred for him, or my fancy for her?”\r\n\r\n“You have no confidence in my honor,” he said, after a pause. “I see\r\nthat you will always be to me the author of your /secret analysis/.\r\nAdieu, madame.”\r\n\r\nMadame Rabourdin bowed coldly. Celestine and Xavier returned at once to\r\ntheir own rooms without a word; both were overcome by their misfortune.\r\nThe wife thought of the dreadful situation in which she stood toward her\r\nhusband. The husband, resolving slowly not to remain at the ministry but\r\nto send in his resignation at once, was lost in a sea of reflections;\r\nthe crisis for him meant a total change of life and the necessity of\r\nstarting on a new career. All night he sat before his fire, taking\r\nno notice of Celestine, who came in several times on tiptoe, in her\r\nnight-dress.\r\n\r\n“I must go once more to the ministry, to bring away my papers, and show\r\nBaudoyer the routine of the business,” he said to himself at last. “I\r\nhad better write my resignation now.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to his table and began to write, thinking over each clause of\r\nthe letter, which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Monseigneur,--I have the honor to inclose to your Excellency my\r\n  resignation. I venture to hope that you still remember hearing me\r\n  say that I left my honor in your hands, and that everything, for\r\n  me, depended on my being able to give you an immediate\r\n  explanation.\r\n\r\n  This explanation I have vainly sought to give. To-day it would,\r\n  perhaps, be useless; for a fragment of my work relating to the\r\n  administration, stolen and misused, has gone the rounds of the\r\n  offices and is misinterpreted by hatred; in consequence, I find\r\n  myself compelled to resign, under the tacit condemnation of my\r\n  superiors.\r\n\r\n  Your Excellency may have thought, on the morning when I first\r\n  sought to speak with you, that my purpose was to ask for my\r\n  promotion, when, in fact, I was thinking only of the glory and\r\n  usefulness of your ministry and of the public good. It is\r\n  all-important, I think, to correct that impression.\r\n\r\nThen followed the usual epistolary formulas.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven in the morning when the man consummated the\r\nsacrifice of his ideas; he burned everything, the toil of years.\r\nFatigued by the pressure of thought, overcome by mental suffering, he\r\nfell asleep with his head on the back of his armchair. He was wakened by\r\na curious sensation, and found his hands covered with his wife’s tears\r\nand saw her kneeling before him. Celestine had read the resignation. She\r\ncould measure the depth of his fall. They were now to be reduced to\r\nlive on four thousand francs a year; and that day she had counted up her\r\ndebts,--they amounted to something like thirty-two thousand francs! The\r\nmost ignoble of all wretchedness had come upon them. And that noble man\r\nwho had trusted her was ignorant that she had abused the fortune he\r\nhad confided to her care. She was sobbing at his feet, beautiful as the\r\nMagdalen.\r\n\r\n“My cup is full,” cried Xavier, in terror. “I am dishonored at the\r\nministry, and dishonored--”\r\n\r\nThe light of her pure honor flashed from Celestine’s eyes; she sprang up\r\nlike a startled horse and cast a fulminating glance at Rabourdin.\r\n\r\n“I! I!” she said, on two sublime tones. “Am I a base wife? If I were,\r\nyou would have been appointed. But,” she added mournfully, “it is easier\r\nto believe that than to believe what is the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Then what is it?” said Rabourdin.\r\n\r\n“All in three words,” she said; “I owe thirty thousand francs.”\r\n\r\nRabourdin caught his wife to his heart with a gesture of almost frantic\r\njoy, and seated her on his knee.\r\n\r\n“Take comfort, dear,” he said, in a tone of voice so adorably kind\r\nthat the bitterness of her grief was changed to something inexpressibly\r\ntender. “I too have made mistakes; I have worked uselessly for my\r\ncountry when I thought I was being useful to her. But now I mean to take\r\nanother path. If I had sold groceries we should now be millionaires.\r\nWell, let us be grocers. You are only twenty-eight, dear angel; in ten\r\nyears you shall recover the luxury that you love, which we must needs\r\nrenounce for a short time. I, too, dear heart, am not a base or common\r\nhusband. We will sell our farm; its value has increased of late. That\r\nand the sale of our furniture will pay my debts.”\r\n\r\n/My/ debts! Celestine embraced her husband a thousand times in the\r\nsingle kiss with which she thanked him for that generous word.\r\n\r\n“We shall still have a hundred thousand francs to put into business.\r\nBefore the month is out I shall find some favorable opening. If luck\r\ngave a Martin Falleix to a Saillard, why should we despair? Wait\r\nbreakfast for me. I am going now to the ministry, but I shall come back\r\nwith my neck free of the yoke.”\r\n\r\nCelestine clasped her husband in her arms with a force men do not\r\npossess, even in their passionate moments; for women are stronger\r\nthrough emotion than men through power. She wept and laughed and sobbed\r\nin turns.\r\n\r\nWhen Rabourdin left the house at eight o’clock, the porter gave him\r\nthe satirical cards suggested by Bixiou. Nevertheless, he went to the\r\nministry, where he found Sebastien waiting near the door to entreat him\r\nnot to enter any of the bureaus, because an infamous caricature of him\r\nwas making the round of the offices.\r\n\r\n“If you wish to soften the pain of my downfall,” he said to the lad,\r\n“bring me that drawing; I am now taking my resignation to Ernest de la\r\nBriere myself, that it may not be altered or distorted while passing\r\nthrough the routine channels. I have my own reasons for wishing to see\r\nthat caricature.”\r\n\r\nWhen Rabourdin came back to the courtyard, after making sure that his\r\nletter would go straight into the minister’s hands, he found Sebastien\r\nin tears, with a copy of the lithograph, which the lad reluctantly\r\nhanded over to him.\r\n\r\n“It is very clever,” said Rabourdin, showing a serene brow to his\r\ncompanion, though the crown of thorns was on it all the same.\r\n\r\nHe entered the bureaus with a calm air, and went at once into Baudoyer’s\r\nsection to ask him to come to the office of the head of the division and\r\nreceive instructions as to the business which that incapable being was\r\nhenceforth to direct.\r\n\r\n“Tell Monsieur Baudoyer that there must be no delay,” he added, in the\r\nhearing of all the clerks; “my resignation is already in the minister’s\r\nhands, and I do not wish to stay here longer than is necessary.”\r\n\r\nSeeing Bixiou, Rabourdin went straight up to him, showed him the\r\nlithograph, and said, to the great astonishment of all present,--\r\n\r\n“Was I not right in saying you were an artist? Still, it is a pity you\r\ndirected the point of your pencil against a man who cannot be judged in\r\nthis way, nor indeed by the bureaus at all;--but everything is laughed\r\nat in France, even God.”\r\n\r\nThen he took Baudoyer into the office of the late La Billardiere. At the\r\ndoor he found Phellion and Sebastien, the only two who, under his great\r\ndisaster, dared to remain openly faithful to the fallen man. Rabourdin\r\nnoticed that Phellion’s eyes were moist, and he could not refrain from\r\nwringing his hand.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the good man, “if we can serve you in any way, make use\r\nof us.”\r\n\r\nMonsieur Rabourdin shut himself up in the late chief’s office with\r\nMonsieur Baudoyer, and Phellion helped him to show the new incumbent all\r\nthe administrative difficulties of his new position. At each separate\r\naffair which Rabourdin carefully explained, Baudoyer’s little eyes grew\r\nbig as saucers.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, monsieur,” said Rabourdin at last, with a manner that was\r\nhalf-solemn, half-satirical.\r\n\r\nSebastien meanwhile had made up a package of papers and letters\r\nbelonging to his chief and had carried them away in a hackney coach.\r\nRabourdin passed through the grand courtyard, while all the clerks\r\nwere watching from the windows, and waited there a moment to see if the\r\nminister would send him any message. His Excellency was dumb. Phellion\r\ncourageously escorted the fallen man to his home, expressing his\r\nfeelings of respectful admiration; then he returned to the office, and\r\ntook up his work, satisfied with his own conduct in rendering these\r\nfuneral honors to the neglected and misjudged administrative talent.\r\n\r\nBixiou [seeing Phellion re-enter]. “Victrix cause diis placuit, sed\r\nvicta Catoni.”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “What does that mean?”\r\n\r\nFleury. “That priests rejoice, and Monsieur Rabourdin has the respect of\r\nmen of honor.”\r\n\r\nDutocq [annoyed]. “You didn’t say that yesterday.”\r\n\r\nFleury. “If you address me you’ll have my hand in your face. It is known\r\nfor certain that you filched those papers from Monsieur Rabourdin.”\r\n [Dutocq leaves the office.] “Oh, yes, go and complain to your Monsieur\r\ndes Lupeaulx, spy!”\r\n\r\nBixiou [laughing and grimacing like a monkey]. “I am curious to know how\r\nthe division will get along. Monsieur Rabourdin is so remarkable a man\r\nthat he must have had some special views in that work of his. Well, the\r\nminister loses a fine mind.” [Rubs his hands.]\r\n\r\nLaurent [entering]. “Monsieur Fleury is requested to go to the\r\nsecretary’s office.”\r\n\r\nAll the clerks. “Done for!”\r\n\r\nFleury [leaving the room]. “I don’t care; I am offered a place as\r\nresponsible editor. I shall have all my time to myself to lounge the\r\nstreets or do amusing work in a newspaper office.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Dutocq has already made them cut off the head of that poor\r\nDesroys.”\r\n\r\nColleville [entering joyously]. “Gentlemen, I am appointed head of this\r\nbureau.”\r\n\r\nThuillier. “Ah, my friend, if it were I myself, I couldn’t be better\r\npleased.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “His wife has managed it.” [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Will any one tell me the meaning of all that is happening here\r\nto-day?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Do you really want to know? Then listen. The antechamber of the\r\nadministration is henceforth a chamber, the court is a boudoir, the best\r\nway to get in is through the cellar, and the bed is more than ever a\r\ncross-cut.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Monsieur Bixiou, may I entreat you, explain?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “I’ll paraphrase my opinion. To be anything at all you must\r\nbegin by being everything. It is quite certain that a reform of this\r\nservice is needed; for on my word of honor, the State robs the poor\r\nofficials as much as the officials rob the State in the matter of hours.\r\nBut why is it that we idle as we do? because they pay us too little; and\r\nthe reason of that is we are too many for the work, and your late\r\nchief, the virtuous Rabourdin, saw all this plainly. That great\r\nadministrator,--for he was that, gentlemen,--saw what the thing\r\nis coming to, the thing that these idiots call the ‘working of\r\nour admirable institutions.’ The chamber will want before long to\r\nadministrate, and the administrators will want to legislate. The\r\ngovernment will try to administrate and the administrators will want to\r\ngovern, and so it will go on. Laws will come to be mere regulations, and\r\nordinances will be thought laws. God made this epoch of the world for\r\nthose who like to laugh. I live in a state of jovial admiration of\r\nthe spectacle which the greatest joker of modern times, Louis XVIII.,\r\nbequeathed to us” [general stupefaction]. “Gentlemen, if France, the\r\ncountry with the best civil service in Europe, is managed thus, what\r\ndo you suppose the other nations are like? Poor unhappy nations! I ask\r\nmyself how they can possibly get along without two Chambers, without the\r\nliberty of the press, without reports, without circulars even, without\r\nan army of clerks? Dear, dear, how do you suppose they have armies and\r\nnavies? how can they exist at all without political discussions?\r\nCan they even be called nations, or governments? It is said (mere\r\ntraveller’s tales) that these strange peoples claim to have a policy,\r\nto wield a certain influence; but that’s absurd! how can they when\r\nthey haven’t ‘progress’ or ‘new lights’? They can’t stir up ideas,\r\nthey haven’t an independent forum; they are still in the twilight of\r\nbarbarism. There are no people in the world but the French people who\r\nhave ideas. Can you understand, Monsieur Poiret,” [Poiret jumped as\r\nif he had been shot] “how a nation can do without heads of divisions,\r\ngeneral-secretaries and directors, and all this splendid array of\r\nofficials, the glory of France and of the Emperor Napoleon,--who had his\r\nown good reasons for creating a myriad of offices? I don’t see how those\r\nnations have the audacity to live at all. There’s Austria, which has\r\nless than a hundred clerks in her war ministry, while the salaries and\r\npensions of ours amount to a third of our whole budget, a thing that was\r\nunheard of before the Revolution. I sum up all I’ve been saying in\r\none single remark, namely, that the Academy of Inscriptions and\r\nBelles-lettres, which seems to have very little to do, had better offer\r\na prize for the ablest answer to the following question: Which is the\r\nbest organized State; the one that does many things with few officials,\r\nor the one that does next to nothing with an army of them?”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Is that your last word?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Yes, sir! whether English, French, German or Italian,--I let\r\nyou off the other languages.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [lifting his hands to heaven]. “Gracious goodness! and they call\r\nyou a witty man!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Haven’t you understood me yet?”\r\n\r\nPhellion. “Your last observation was full of excellent sense.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Just as full as the budget itself, and like the budget again,\r\nas complicated as it looks simple; and I set it as a warning, a beacon,\r\nat the edge of this hole, this gulf, this volcano, called, in the\r\nlanguage of the ‘Constitutionel,’ ‘the political horizon.’”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I should much prefer a comprehensible explanation.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Hurrah for Rabourdin! there’s my explanation; that’s my\r\nopinion. Are you satisfied?”\r\n\r\nColleville [gravely]. “Monsieur Rabourdin had but one defect.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “What was it?”\r\n\r\nColleville. “That of being a statesman instead of a subordinate\r\nofficial.”\r\n\r\nPhellion [standing before Bixiou]. “Monsieur! why did you, who\r\nunderstand Monsieur Rabourdin so well, why did you make that inf--that\r\nodi--that hideous caricature?”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Do you forget our bet? don’t you know I was backing the devil’s\r\ngame, and that your bureau owes me a dinner at the Rocher de Cancale?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [much put-out]. “Then it is a settled thing that I am to leave\r\nthis government office without ever understanding a sentence, or a\r\nsingle word uttered by Monsieur Bixiou.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “It is your own fault; ask these gentlemen. Gentlemen, have you\r\nunderstood the meaning of my observations? and were those observations\r\njust, and brilliant?”\r\n\r\nAll. “Alas, yes!”\r\n\r\nMinard. “And the proof is that I shall send in my resignation. I shall\r\nplunge into industrial avocations.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “What! have you managed to invent a mechanical corset, or a\r\nbaby’s bottle, or a fire engine, or chimneys that consume no fuel, or\r\novens which cook cutlets with three sheets of paper?”\r\n\r\nMinard [departing.] “Adieu, I shall keep my secret.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Well, young Poiret junior, you see,--all these gentlemen\r\nunderstand me.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [crest-fallen]. “Monsieur Bixiou, would you do me the honor\r\nto come down for once to my level and speak in a language I can\r\nunderstand?”\r\n\r\nBixiou [winking at the rest]. “Willingly.” [Takes Poiret by the button\r\nof his frock-coat.] “Before you leave this office forever perhaps you\r\nwould be glad to know what you are--”\r\n\r\nPoiret [quickly]. “An honest man, monsieur.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [shrugging his shoulders]. “--to be able to define, explain, and\r\nanalyze precisely what a government clerk is? Do you know what he is?”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “I think I do.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [twisting the button]. “I doubt it.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “He is a man paid by government to do work.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Oh! then a soldier is a government clerk?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [puzzled]. “Why, no.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “But he is paid by the government to do work, to mount guard and\r\nshow off at reviews. You may perhaps tell me that he longs to get out of\r\nhis place,--that he works too hard and fingers too little metal, except\r\nthat of his musket.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [his eyes wide open]. “Monsieur, a government clerk is, logically\r\nspeaking, a man who needs the salary to maintain himself, and is not\r\nfree to get out of his place; for he doesn’t know how to do anything but\r\ncopy papers.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Ah! now we are coming to a conclusion. So the bureau is the\r\nclerk’s shell, husk, pod. No clerk without a bureau, no bureau without\r\na clerk. But what do you make, then, of a customs officer?” [Poiret\r\nshuffles his feet and tries to edge away; Bixiou twists off one button\r\nand catches him by another.] “He is, from the bureaucratic point of\r\nview, a neutral being. The excise-man is only half a clerk; he is on the\r\nconfines between civil and military service; neither altogether soldier\r\nnor altogether clerk--Here, here, where are you going?” [Twists the\r\nbutton.] “Where does the government clerk proper end? That’s a serious\r\nquestion. Is a prefect a clerk?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [hesitating]. “He is a functionary.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “But you don’t mean that a functionary is not a clerk? that’s an\r\nabsurdity.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [weary and looking round for escape]. “I think Monsieur Godard\r\nwants to say something.”\r\n\r\nGodard. “The clerk is the order, the functionary the species.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [laughing]. “I shouldn’t have thought you capable of that\r\ndistinction, my brave subordinate.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [trying to get away]. “Incomprehensible!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “La, la, papa, don’t step on your tether. If you stand still and\r\nlisten, we shall come to an understanding before long. Now, here’s an\r\naxiom which I bequeath to this bureau and to all bureaus: Where the\r\nclerk ends, the functionary begins; where the functionary ends, the\r\nstatesman rises. There are very few statesmen among the prefects. The\r\nprefect is therefore a neutral being among the higher species. He comes\r\nbetween the statesman and the clerk, just as the custom-house officer\r\nstands between the civil and the military. Let us continue to clear up\r\nthese important points.” [Poiret turns crimson with distress.] “Suppose\r\nwe formulate the whole matter in a maxim worthy of Larochefoucault:\r\nOfficials with salaries of twenty thousand francs are not clerks. From\r\nwhich we may deduce mathematically this corollary: The statesman first\r\nlooms up in the sphere of higher salaries; and also this second and\r\nnot less logical and important corollary: Directors-general may be\r\nstatesmen. Perhaps it is in that sense that more than one deputy says\r\nin his heart, ‘It is a fine thing to be a director-general.’ But in the\r\ninterests of our noble French language and of the Academy--”\r\n\r\nPoiret [magnetized by the fixity of Bixiou’s eye]. “The French language!\r\nthe Academy!”\r\n\r\nBixiou [twisting off the second button and seizing another]. “Yes, in\r\nthe interests of our noble tongue, it is proper to observe that although\r\nthe head of a bureau, strictly speaking, may be called a clerk, the head\r\nof a division must be called a bureaucrat. These gentlemen” [turning\r\nto the clerks and privately showing them the third button off Poiret’s\r\ncoat] “will appreciate this delicate shade of meaning. And so, papa\r\nPoiret, don’t you see it is clear that the government clerk comes to\r\na final end at the head of a division? Now that question once settled,\r\nthere is no longer any uncertainty; the government clerk who has\r\nhitherto seemed undefinable is defined.”\r\n\r\nPoiret. “Yes, that appears to me beyond a doubt.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “Nevertheless, do me the kindness to answer the following\r\nquestion: A judge being irremovable, and consequently debarred from\r\nbeing, according to your subtle distinction, a functionary, and\r\nreceiving a salary which is not the equivalent of the work he does, is\r\nhe to be included in the class of clerks?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [gazing at the cornice]. “Monsieur, I don’t follow you.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [getting off the fourth button]. “I wanted to prove to you,\r\nmonsieur, that nothing is simple; but above all--and what I am going to\r\nsay is intended for philosophers--I wish (if you’ll allow me to misquote\r\na saying of Louis XVIII.),--I wish to make you see that definitions lead\r\nto muddles.”\r\n\r\nPoiret [wiping his forehead]. “Excuse me, I am sick at my stomach”\r\n [tries to button his coat]. “Ah! you have cut off all my buttons!”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “But the point is, /do you understand me/?”\r\n\r\nPoiret [angrily]. “Yes, monsieur, I do; I understand that you have been\r\nplaying me a shameful trick and twisting off my buttons while I have\r\nbeen standing here unconscious of it.”\r\n\r\nBixiou [solemnly]. “Old man, you are mistaken! I wished to stamp upon\r\nyour brain the clearest possible image of constitutional government”\r\n [all the clerks look at Bixiou; Poiret, stupefied, gazes at him\r\nuneasily], “and also to keep my word to you. In so doing I employed\r\nthe parabolical method of savages. Listen and comprehend: While the\r\nministers start discussions in the Chambers that are just about\r\nas useful and as conclusive as the one we are engaged in, the\r\nadministration cuts the buttons off the tax-payers.”\r\n\r\nAll. “Bravo, Bixiou!”\r\n\r\nPoiret [who comprehends]. “I don’t regret my buttons.”\r\n\r\nBixiou. “I shall follow Minard’s example; I won’t pocket such a\r\npaltry salary as mine any longer; I shall deprive the government of my\r\nco-operation.” [Departs amid general laughter.]\r\n\r\nAnother scene was taking place in the minister’s reception-room, more\r\ninstructive than the one we have just related, because it shows how\r\ngreat ideas are allowed to perish in the higher regions of State\r\naffairs, and in what way statesmen console themselves.\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx was presenting the new director, Monsieur Baudoyer, to the\r\nminister. A number of persons were assembled in the salon,--two or three\r\nministerial deputies, a few men of influence, and Monsieur Clergeot\r\n(whose division was now merged with La Billardiere’s under Baudoyer’s\r\ndirection), to whom the minister was promising an honorable pension.\r\nAfter a few general remarks, the great event of the day was brought up.\r\n\r\nA deputy. “So you lose Rabourdin?”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx. “He has resigned.”\r\n\r\nClergeot. “They say he wanted to reform the administration.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister [looking at the deputies]. “Salaries are not really in\r\nproportion to the exigencies of the civil service.”\r\n\r\nDe la Briere. “According to Monsieur Rabourdin, one hundred clerks with\r\na salary of twelve thousand francs would do better and quicker work than\r\na thousand clerks at twelve hundred.”\r\n\r\nClergeot. “Perhaps he is right.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister. “But what is to be done? The machine is built in that way.\r\nMust we take it to pieces and remake it? No one would have the courage\r\nto attempt that in face of the Chamber, and the foolish outcries of the\r\nOpposition, and the fierce denunciations of the press. It follows\r\nthat there will happen, one of these days, some damaging ‘solution of\r\ncontinuity’ between the government and the administration.”\r\n\r\nA deputy. “In what way?”\r\n\r\nThe Minister. “In many ways. A minister will want to serve the public\r\ngood, and will not be allowed to do so. You will create interminable\r\ndelays between things and their results. You may perhaps render the\r\ntheft of a penny actually impossible, but you cannot prevent the buying\r\nand selling of influence, the collusions of self-interest. The day will\r\ncome when nothing will be conceded without secret stipulations, which\r\nmay never see the light. Moreover, the clerks, one and all, from the\r\nleast to the greatest, are acquiring opinions of their own; they will\r\nsoon be no longer the hands of a brain, the scribes of governmental\r\nthought; the Opposition even now tends towards giving them a right to\r\njudge the government and to talk and vote against it.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [in a low voice, but meaning to be heard]. “Monseigneur is\r\nreally fine.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx. “Of course bureaucracy has its defects. I myself think it\r\nslow and insolent; it hampers ministerial action, stifles projects, and\r\narrests progress. But, after all, French administration is amazingly\r\nuseful.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer. “Certainly!”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx. “If only to maintain the paper and stamp industries!\r\nSuppose it is rather fussy and provoking, like all good\r\nhousekeepers,--it can at any moment render an account of its\r\ndisbursements. Where is the merchant who would not gladly give five\r\nper cent of his entire capital if he could insure himself against\r\n/leakage/?”\r\n\r\nThe Deputy [a manufacturer]. “The manufacturing interests of all nations\r\nwould joyfully unite against that evil genius of theirs called leakage.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx. “After all, though statistics are the childish foible of\r\nmodern statesmen, who think that figures are estimates, we must cipher\r\nto estimate. Figures are, moreover, the convincing argument of societies\r\nbased on self-interest and money, and that is the sort of society the\r\nCharter has given us,--in my opinion, at any rate. Nothing convinces the\r\n‘intelligent masses’ as much as a row of figures. All things in the long\r\nrun, say the statesmen of the Left, resolve themselves into figures.\r\nWell then, let us figure” [the minister here goes off into a corner with\r\na deputy, to whom he talks in a low voice]. “There are forty thousand\r\ngovernment clerks in France. The average of their salaries is fifteen\r\nhundred francs. Multiply forty thousand by fifteen hundred and you have\r\nsixty millions. Now, in the first place, a publicist would call the\r\nattention of Russia and China (where all government officials steal),\r\nalso that of Austria, the American republics, and indeed that of the\r\nwhole world, to the fact that for this price France possesses the\r\nmost inquisitorial, fussy, ferreting, scribbling, paper-blotting,\r\nfault-finding old housekeeper of a civil service on God’s earth. Not a\r\ncopper farthing of the nation’s money is spent or hoarded that is not\r\nordered by a note, proved by vouchers, produced and re-produced on\r\nbalance-sheets, and receipted for when paid; orders and receipts are\r\nregistered on the rolls, and checked and verified by an army of men\r\nin spectacles. If there is the slightest mistake in the form of these\r\nprecious documents, the clerk is terrified, for he lives on such\r\nminutiae. Some nations would be satisfied to get as far as this;\r\nbut Napoleon went further. That great organizer appointed supreme\r\nmagistrates of a court which is absolutely unique in the world. These\r\nofficials pass their days in verifying money-orders, documents, roles,\r\nregisters, lists, permits, custom-house receipts, payments, taxes\r\nreceived, taxes spent, etc.; all of which the clerks write or\r\ncopy. These stern judges push the gift of exactitude, the genius of\r\ninquisition, the sharp-sightedness of lynxes, the perspicacity of\r\naccount-books to the point of going over all the additions in search of\r\nsubtractions. These sublime martyrs to figures have been known to return\r\nto an army commissary, after a delay of two years, some account in which\r\nthere was an error of two farthings. This is how and why it is that the\r\nFrench system of administration, the purest and best on the globe\r\nhas rendered robbery, as his Excellency has just told you, next to\r\nimpossible, and as for peculation, it is a myth. France at this present\r\ntime possesses a revenue of twelve hundred millions, and she spends it.\r\nThat sum enters her treasury, and that sum goes out of it. She handles,\r\ntherefore, two thousand four hundred millions, and all she pays for the\r\nlabor of those who do the work is sixty millions,--two and a half per\r\ncent; and for that she obtains the certainty that there is no leakage.\r\nOur political and administrative kitchen costs us sixty millions, but\r\nthe gendarmerie, the courts of law, the galleys and the police cost just\r\nas much, and give no return. Moreover, we employ a body of men who could\r\ndo no other work. Waste and disorder, if such there be, can only be\r\nlegislative; the Chambers lead to them and render them legal. Leakage\r\nfollows in the form of public works which are neither urgent nor\r\nnecessary; troops re-uniformed and gold-laced over and over again;\r\nvessels sent on useless cruises; preparations for war without ever\r\nmaking it; paying the debts of a State, and not requiring reimbursement\r\nor insisting on security.”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer. “But such leakage has nothing to do with the subordinate\r\nofficials; this bad management of national affairs concerns the\r\nstatesmen who guide the ship.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister [who has finished his conversation]. “There is a great deal\r\nof truth in what des Lupeaulx has just said; but let me tell you” [to\r\nBaudoyer], “Monsieur le directeur, that few men see from the standpoint\r\nof a statesman. To order expenditure of all kinds, even useless ones,\r\ndoes not constitute bad management. Such acts contribute to the movement\r\nof money, the stagnation of which becomes, especially in France,\r\ndangerous to the public welfare, by reason of the miserly and profoundly\r\nillogical habits of the provinces which hoard their gold.”\r\n\r\nThe Deputy [who listened to des Lupeaulx]. “But it seems to me that\r\nif your Excellency was right just now, and if our clever friend here”\r\n [takes Lupeaulx by the arm] “was not wrong, it will be difficult to come\r\nto any conclusion on the subject.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx [after looking at the minister]. “No doubt something ought\r\nto be done.”\r\n\r\nDe la Briere [timidly]. “Monsieur Rabourdin seems to have judged\r\nrightly.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister. “I will see Rabourdin.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx. “The poor man made the blunder of constituting himself\r\nsupreme judge of the administration and of all the officials who compose\r\nit; he wants to do away with the present state of things, and he demands\r\nthat there be only three ministries.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister. “He must be crazy.”\r\n\r\nThe Deputy. “How do you represent in three ministries the heads of all\r\nthe parties in the Chamber?”\r\n\r\nBaudoyer [with an air that he imagined to be shrewd]. “Perhaps Monsieur\r\nRabourdin desired to change the Constitution, which we owe to our\r\nlegislative sovereign.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister [thoughtful, takes La Briere’s arm and leads him into the\r\nstudy]. “I want to see that work of Rabourdin’s, and as you know about\r\nit--”\r\n\r\nDe la Briere. “He has burned it. You allowed him to be dishonored and he\r\nhas resigned from the ministry. Do not think for a moment, Monseigneur,\r\nthat Rabourdin ever had the absurd thought (as des Lupeaulx tries to\r\nmake it believed) to change the admirable centralization of power.”\r\n\r\nThe Minister [to himself]. “I have made a mistake” [is silent a moment].\r\n“No matter; we shall never be lacking in plans for reform.”\r\n\r\nDe la Briere. “It is not ideas, but men capable of executing them that\r\nwe lack.”\r\n\r\nDes Lupeaulx, that adroit advocate of abuses came into the minister’s\r\nstudy at this moment.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, I start at once for my election.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment,” said his Excellency, leaving the private secretary and\r\ntaking des Lupeaulx by the arm into the recess of a window. “My dear\r\nfriend, let me have that arrondissement,--if you will, you shall be\r\nmade count and I will pay your debts. Later, if I remain in the ministry\r\nafter the new Chamber is elected, I will find a way to send in your name\r\nin a batch for the peerage.”\r\n\r\n“You are a man of honor, and I accept.”\r\n\r\nThis is how it came to pass that Clement Chardin des Lupeaulx, whose\r\nfather was ennobled under Louis XV., and who beareth quarterly, first,\r\nargent, a wolf ravisant carrying a lamb gules; second, purpure, three\r\nmascles argent, two and one; third, paly of twelve, gules and argent;\r\nfourth, or, on a pale endorsed, three batons fleurdelises gules;\r\nsupported by four griffon’s-claws jessant from the sides of the\r\nescutcheon, with the motto “En Lupus in Historia,” was able to surmount\r\nthese rather satirical arms with a count’s coronet.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year 1830 Monsieur Rabourdin did some business\r\non hand which required him to visit the old ministry, where the\r\nbureaus had all been in great commotion, owing to a general removal\r\nof officials, from the highest to the lowest. This revolution bore\r\nheaviest, in point of fact, upon the lackeys, who are not fond of seeing\r\nnew faces. Rabourdin had come early, knowing all the ways of the place,\r\nand he thus chanced to overhear a dialogue between the two nephews of\r\nold Antoine, who had recently retired on a pension.\r\n\r\n“Well, Laurent, how is your chief of division going on?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t talk to me about him; I can’t do anything with him. He\r\nrings me up to ask if I have seen his handkerchief or his snuff-box. He\r\nreceives people without making them wait; in short, he hasn’t a bit of\r\ndignity. I’m often obliged to say to him: But, monsieur, monsieur le\r\ncomte your predecessor, for the credit of the thing, used to punch\r\nholes with his penknife in the arms of his chair to make believe he\r\nwas working. And he makes such a mess of his room. I find everything\r\ntopsy-turvy. He has a very small mind. How about your man?”\r\n\r\n“Mine? Oh, I have succeeded in training him. He knows exactly where his\r\nletter-paper and envelopes, his wood, and his boxes and all the rest of\r\nhis things are. The other man used to swear at me, but this one is as\r\nmeek as a lamb,--still, he hasn’t the grand style! Moreover, he isn’t\r\ndecorated, and I don’t like to serve a chief who isn’t; he might be\r\ntaken for one of us, and that’s humiliating. He carries the office\r\nletter-paper home, and asked me if I couldn’t go there and wait at table\r\nwhen there was company.”\r\n\r\n“Hey! what a government, my dear fellow!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed; everybody plays low in these days.”\r\n\r\n“I hope they won’t cut down our poor wages.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid they will. The Chambers are prying into everything. Why,\r\nthey even count the sticks of wood.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it can’t last long if they go on that way.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, we’re caught! somebody is listening.”\r\n\r\n“Hey! it is the late Monsieur Rabourdin. Ah, monsieur, I knew your step.\r\nIf you have business to transact here I am afraid you will not find any\r\none who is aware of the respect that ought to be paid to you; Laurent\r\nand I are the only persons remaining about the place who were here in\r\nyour day. Messieurs Colleville and Baudoyer didn’t wear out the morocco\r\nof the chairs after you left. Heavens, no! six months later they were\r\nmade Collectors of Paris.”\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nNote.--Anagrams cannot, of course, be translated; that is why three\r\nEnglish ones have been substituted for some in French.
