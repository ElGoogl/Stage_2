  "content": "THE EIGHTEENTH BRUMAIRE OF LOUIS BONAPARTE ***\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\r\n\r\nby Karl Marx\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n Translator’s Preface\r\n I.\r\n II.\r\n III.\r\n IV.\r\n V.\r\n VI.\r\n VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslator’s Preface\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte” is one of Karl Marx’ most\r\nprofound and most brilliant monographs. It may be considered the best\r\nwork extant on the philosophy of history, with an eye especially upon\r\nthe history of the Movement of the Proletariat, together with the\r\nbourgeois and other manifestations that accompany the same, and the\r\ntactics that such conditions dictate.\r\n\r\nThe recent populist uprising; the more recent “Debs Movement”; the\r\nthousand and one utopian and chimerical notions that are flaring up;\r\nthe capitalist maneuvers; the hopeless, helpless grasping after straws,\r\nthat characterize the conduct of the bulk of the working class; all of\r\nthese, together with the empty-headed, ominous figures that are\r\nspringing into notoriety for a time and have their day, mark the\r\npresent period of the Labor Movement in the nation a critical one. The\r\nbest information acquirable, the best mental training obtainable are\r\nrequisite to steer through the existing chaos that the death-tainted\r\nsocial system of today creates all around us. To aid in this needed\r\ninformation and mental training, this instructive work is now made\r\naccessible to English readers, and is commended to the serious study of\r\nthe serious.\r\n\r\nThe teachings contained in this work are hung on an episode in recent\r\nFrench history. With some this fact may detract of its value. A\r\npedantic, supercilious notion is extensively abroad among us that we\r\nare an “Anglo Saxon” nation; and an equally pedantic, supercilious\r\nhabit causes many to look to England for inspiration, as from a racial\r\nbirthplace. Nevertheless, for weal or for woe, there is no such thing\r\nextant as “Anglo-Saxon”—of all nations, said to be “Anglo-Saxon,” in\r\nthe United States least. What we still have from England, much as\r\nappearances may seem to point the other way, is not of our\r\nbone-and-marrow, so to speak, but rather partakes of the nature of\r\n“importations.” We are no more English on account of them than we are\r\nChinese because we all drink tea.\r\n\r\nOf all European nations, France is the on to which we come nearest.\r\nBesides its republican form of government—the directness of its\r\nhistory, the unity of its actions, the sharpness that marks its\r\ninternal development, are all characteristics that find their parallel\r\nher best, and vice versa. In all essentials the study of modern French\r\nhistory, particularly when sketched by such a master hand as Marx’, is\r\nthe most valuable one for the acquisition of that historic, social and\r\nbiologic insight that our country stands particularly in need of, and\r\nthat will be inestimable during the approaching critical days.\r\n\r\nFor the assistance of those who, unfamiliar with the history of France,\r\nmay be confused by some of the terms used by Marx, the following\r\nexplanations may prove aidful:\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Brumaire (Nov. 9th), the post-revolutionary development of\r\naffairs in France enabled the first Napoleon to take a step that led\r\nwith inevitable certainty to the imperial throne. The circumstance that\r\nfifty and odd years later similar events aided his nephew, Louis\r\nBonaparte, to take a similar step with a similar result, gives the name\r\nto this work—“The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte.”\r\n\r\nAs to the other terms and allusions that occur, the following sketch\r\nwill suffice:\r\n\r\nUpon the overthrow of the first Napoleon came the restoration of the\r\nBourbon throne (Louis XVIII, succeeded by Charles X). In July, 1830, an\r\nuprising of the upper tier of the bourgeoisie, or capitalist class—the\r\naristocracy of finance—overthrew the Bourbon throne, or landed\r\naristocracy, and set up the throne of Orleans, a younger branch of the\r\nhouse of Bourbon, with Louis Philippe as king. From the month in which\r\nthis revolution occurred, Louis Philippe’s monarchy is called the “July\r\nMonarchy.” In February, 1848, a revolt of a lower tier of the\r\ncapitalist class—the industrial bourgeoisie—against the aristocracy of\r\nfinance, in turn dethroned Louis Philippe. The affair, also named from\r\nthe month in which it took place, is the “February Revolution”. “The\r\nEighteenth Brumaire” starts with that event.\r\n\r\nDespite the inapplicableness to our affairs of the political names and\r\npolitical leadership herein described, both these names and leaderships\r\nare to such an extent the products of an economic-social development\r\nthat has here too taken place with even greater sharpens, and they have\r\ntheir present or threatened counterparts here so completely, that, by\r\nthe light of this work of Marx’, we are best enabled to understand our\r\nown history, to know whence we came, and whither we are going and how\r\nto conduct ourselves.\r\n\r\nD.D.L. New York, Sept. 12, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH BRUMAIRE OF LOUIS BONAPARTE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHegel says somewhere that that great historic facts and personages\r\nrecur twice. He forgot to add: “Once as tragedy, and again as farce.”\r\nCaussidiere for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the “Mountain” of\r\n1848-51 for the “Mountain” of 1793-05, the Nephew for the Uncle. The\r\nidentical caricature marks also the conditions under which the second\r\nedition of the eighteenth Brumaire is issued.\r\n\r\nMan makes his own history, but he does not make it out of the whole\r\ncloth; he does not make it out of conditions chosen by himself, but out\r\nof such as he finds close at hand. The tradition of all past\r\ngenerations weighs like an alp upon the brain of the living. At the\r\nvery time when men appear engaged in revolutionizing things and\r\nthemselves, in bringing about what never was before, at such very\r\nepochs of revolutionary crisis do they anxiously conjure up into their\r\nservice the spirits of the past, assume their names, their battle\r\ncries, their costumes to enact a new historic scene in such\r\ntime-honored disguise and with such borrowed language Thus did Luther\r\nmasquerade as the Apostle Paul; thus did the revolution of 1789-1814\r\ndrape itself alternately as Roman Republic and as Roman Empire; nor did\r\nthe revolution of 1818 know what better to do than to parody at one\r\ntime the year 1789, at another the revolutionary traditions of 1793-95.\r\nThus does the beginner, who has acquired a new language, keep on\r\ntranslating it back into his own mother tongue; only then has he\r\ngrasped the spirit of the new language and is able freely to express\r\nhimself therewith when he moves in it without recollections of the old,\r\nand has forgotten in its use his own hereditary tongue.\r\n\r\nWhen these historic configurations of the dead past are closely\r\nobserved a striking difference is forthwith noticeable. Camille\r\nDesmoulins, Danton, Robespierre, St. Juste, Napoleon, the heroes as\r\nwell as the parties and the masses of the old French revolution,\r\nachieved in Roman costumes and with Roman phrases the task of their\r\ntime: the emancipation and the establishment of modern bourgeois\r\nsociety. One set knocked to pieces the old feudal groundwork and mowed\r\ndown the feudal heads that had grown upon it; Napoleon brought about,\r\nwithin France, the conditions under which alone free competition could\r\ndevelop, the partitioned lands be exploited, the nation’s unshackled\r\npowers of industrial production be utilized; while, beyond the French\r\nfrontier, he swept away everywhere the establishments of feudality, so\r\nfar as requisite, to furnish the bourgeois social system of France with\r\nfit surroundings of the European continent, and such as were in keeping\r\nwith the times. Once the new social establishment was set on foot, the\r\nantediluvian giants vanished, and, along with them, the resuscitated\r\nRoman world—the Brutuses, Gracchi, Publicolas, the Tribunes, the\r\nSenators, and Caesar himself. In its sober reality, bourgeois society\r\nhad produced its own true interpretation in the Says, Cousins,\r\nRoyer-Collards, Benjamin Constants and Guizots; its real generals sat\r\nbehind the office desks; and the mutton-head of Louis XVIII was its\r\npolitical lead. Wholly absorbed in the production of wealth and in the\r\npeaceful fight of competition, this society could no longer understand\r\nthat the ghosts of the days of Rome had watched over its cradle. And\r\nyet, lacking in heroism as bourgeois society is, it nevertheless had\r\nstood in need of heroism, of self-sacrifice, of terror, of civil war,\r\nand of bloody battle fields to bring it into the world. Its gladiators\r\nfound in the stern classic traditions of the Roman republic the ideals\r\nand the form, the self-deceptions, that they needed in order to conceal\r\nfrom themselves the narrow bourgeois substance of their own struggles,\r\nand to keep their passion up to the height of a great historic tragedy.\r\nThus, at another stage of development a century before, did Cromwell\r\nand the English people draw from the Old Testament the language,\r\npassions and illusions for their own bourgeois revolution. When the\r\nreal goal was reached, when the remodeling of English society was\r\naccomplished, Locke supplanted Habakuk.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the reviving of the dead in those revolutions served the\r\npurpose of glorifying the new struggles, not of parodying the old; it\r\nserved the purpose of exaggerating to the imagination the given task,\r\nnot to recoil before its practical solution; it served the purpose of\r\nrekindling the revolutionary spirit, not to trot out its ghost.\r\n\r\nIn 1848-51 only the ghost of the old revolution wandered about, from\r\nMarrast the “Republicain en gaunts jaunes,” [#1 Silk-stocking\r\nrepublican] who disguised himself in old Bailly, down to the\r\nadventurer, who hid his repulsively trivial features under the iron\r\ndeath mask of Napoleon. A whole people, that imagines it has imparted\r\nto itself accelerated powers of motion through a revolution, suddenly\r\nfinds itself transferred back to a dead epoch, and, lest there be any\r\nmistake possible on this head, the old dates turn up again; the old\r\ncalendars; the old names; the old edicts, which long since had sunk to\r\nthe level of the antiquarian’s learning; even the old bailiffs, who had\r\nlong seemed mouldering with decay. The nation takes on the appearance\r\nof that crazy Englishman in Bedlam, who imagines he is living in the\r\ndays of the Pharaohs, and daily laments the hard work that he must do\r\nin the Ethiopian mines as gold digger, immured in a subterranean\r\nprison, with a dim lamp fastened on his head, behind him the slave\r\noverseer with a long whip, and, at the mouths of the mine a mob of\r\nbarbarous camp servants who understand neither the convicts in the\r\nmines nor one another, because they do not speak a common language.\r\n“And all this,” cries the crazy Englishman, “is demanded of me, the\r\nfree-born Englishman, in order to make gold for old Pharaoh.” “In order\r\nto pay off the debts of the Bonaparte family”—sobs the French nation.\r\nThe Englishman, so long as he was in his senses, could not rid himself\r\nof the rooted thought making gold. The Frenchmen, so long as they were\r\nbusy with a revolution, could not rid then selves of the Napoleonic\r\nmemory, as the election of December 10th proved. They longed to escape\r\nfrom the dangers of revolution back to the flesh pots of Egypt; the 2d\r\nof December, 1851 was the answer. They have not merely the character of\r\nthe old Napoleon, but the old Napoleon himself—caricatured as he needs\r\nmust appear in the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe social revolution of the nineteenth century can not draw its poetry\r\nfrom the past, it can draw that only from the future. It cannot start\r\nupon its work before it has stricken off all superstition concerning\r\nthe past. Former revolutions require historic reminiscences in order to\r\nintoxicate themselves with their own issues. The revolution of the\r\nnineteenth century must let the dead bury their dead in order to reach\r\nits issue. With the former, the phrase surpasses the substance; with\r\nthis one, the substance surpasses the phrase.\r\n\r\nThe February revolution was a surprisal; old society was taken\r\nunawares; and the people proclaimed this political stroke a great\r\nhistoric act whereby the new era was opened. On the 2d of December, the\r\nFebruary revolution is jockeyed by the trick of a false player, and\r\nwhat seems to be overthrown is no longer the monarchy, but the liberal\r\nconcessions which had been wrung from it by centuries of struggles.\r\nInstead of society itself having conquered a new point, only the State\r\nappears to have returned to its oldest form, to the simply brazen rule\r\nof the sword and the club. Thus, upon the “coup de main” of February,\r\n1848, comes the response of the “coup de tete” December, 1851. So won,\r\nso lost. Meanwhile, the interval did not go by unutilized. During the\r\nyears 1848-1851, French society retrieved in abbreviated, because\r\nrevolutionary, method the lessons and teachings, which—if it was to be\r\nmore than a disturbance of the surface—should have preceded the\r\nFebruary revolution, had it developed in regular order, by rule, so to\r\nsay. Now French society seems to have receded behind its point of\r\ndeparture; in fact, however, it was compelled to first produce its own\r\nrevolutionary point of departure, the situation, circumstances,\r\nconditions, under which alone the modern revolution is in earnest.\r\n\r\nBourgeois revolutions, like those of the eighteenth century, rush\r\nonward rapidly from success to success, their stage effects outbid one\r\nanother, men and things seem to be set in flaming brilliants, ecstasy\r\nis the prevailing spirit; but they are short-lived, they reach their\r\nclimax speedily, then society relapses into a long fit of nervous\r\nreaction before it learns how to appropriate the fruits of its period\r\nof feverish excitement. Proletarian revolutions, on the contrary, such\r\nas those of the nineteenth century, criticize themselves constantly;\r\nconstantly interrupt themselves in their own course; come back to what\r\nseems to have been accomplished, in order to start over anew; scorn\r\nwith cruel thoroughness the half measures, weaknesses and meannesses of\r\ntheir first attempts; seem to throw down their adversary only in order\r\nto enable him to draw fresh strength from the earth, and again, to rise\r\nup against them in more gigantic stature; constantly recoil in fear\r\nbefore the undefined monster magnitude of their own objects—until\r\nfinally that situation is created which renders all retreat impossible,\r\nand the conditions themselves cry out:\r\n\r\n“Hic Rhodus, hic salta!”\r\n[#2 Here is Rhodes, leap here! An allusion to Aesop’s Fables.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery observer of average intelligence; even if he failed to follow\r\nstep by step the course of French development, must have anticipated\r\nthat an unheard of fiasco was in store for the revolution. It was\r\nenough to hear the self-satisfied yelpings of victory wherewith the\r\nMessieurs Democrats mutually congratulated one another upon the pardons\r\nof May 2d, 1852. Indeed, May 2d had become a fixed idea in their heads;\r\nit had become a dogma with them—something like the day on which Christ\r\nwas to reappear and the Millennium to begin had formed in the heads of\r\nthe Chiliasts. Weakness had, as it ever does, taken refuge in the\r\nwonderful; it believed the enemy was overcome if, in its imagination,\r\nit hocus-pocused him away; and it lost all sense of the present in the\r\nimaginary apotheosis of the future, that was at hand, and of the deeds,\r\nthat it had “in petto,” but which it did not yet want to bring to the\r\nscratch. The heroes, who ever seek to refute their established\r\nincompetence by mutually bestowing their sympathy upon one another and\r\nby pulling together, had packed their satchels, taken their laurels in\r\nadvance payments and were just engaged in the work of getting\r\ndiscounted “in partibus,” on the stock exchange, the republics for\r\nwhich, in the silence of their unassuming dispositions, they had\r\ncarefully organized the government personnel. The 2d of December struck\r\nthem like a bolt from a clear sky; and the peoples, who, in periods of\r\ntimid despondency, gladly allow their hidden fears to be drowned by the\r\nloudest screamers, will perhaps have become convinced that the days are\r\ngone by when the cackling of geese could save the Capitol.\r\n\r\nThe constitution, the national assembly, the dynastic parties, the blue\r\nand the red republicans, the heroes from Africa, the thunder from the\r\ntribune, the flash-lightnings from the daily press, the whole\r\nliterature, the political names and the intellectual celebrities, the\r\ncivil and the criminal law, the “liberte’, egalite’, fraternite’,”\r\ntogether with the 2d of May 1852—all vanished like a phantasmagoria\r\nbefore the ban of one man, whom his enemies themselves do not pronounce\r\nan adept at witchcraft. Universal suffrage seems to have survived only\r\nfor a moment, to the end that, before the eyes of the whole world, it\r\nshould make its own testament with its own hands, and, in the name of\r\nthe people, declare: “All that exists deserves to perish.”\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to say, as the Frenchmen do, that their nation was\r\ntaken by surprise. A nation, no more than a woman, is excused for the\r\nunguarded hour when the first adventurer who comes along can do\r\nviolence to her. The riddle is not solved by such shifts, it is only\r\nformulated in other words. There remains to be explained how a nation\r\nof thirty-six millions can be surprised by three swindlers, and taken\r\nto prison without resistance.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate in general outlines the phases which the French\r\nrevolution of February 24th, 1848, to December, 1851, ran through.\r\n\r\nThree main periods are unmistakable:\r\n\r\nFirst—The February period;\r\n\r\nSecond—The period of constituting the republic, or of the constitutive\r\nnational assembly (May 4, 1848, to May 29th, 1849);\r\n\r\nThird—The period of the constitutional republic, or of the legislative\r\nnational assembly (May 29, 1849, to December 2, 1851).\r\n\r\nThe first period, from February 24, or the downfall of Louis Philippe,\r\nto May 4, 1848, the date of the assembling of the constitutive\r\nassembly—the February period proper—may be designated as the prologue\r\nof the revolution. It officially expressed its own character in this,\r\nthat the government which it improvised declared itself “provisional;”\r\nand, like the government, everything that was broached, attempted, or\r\nuttered, pronounced itself provisional. Nobody and nothing dared to\r\nassume the right of permanent existence and of an actual fact. All the\r\nelements that had prepared or determined the revolution—dynastic\r\nopposition, republican bourgeoisie, democratic-republican small\r\ntraders’ class, social-democratic labor element—all found\r\n“provisionally” their place in the February government.\r\n\r\nIt could not be otherwise. The February days contemplated originally a\r\nreform of the suffrage laws, whereby the area of the politically\r\nprivileged among the property-holding class was to be extended, while\r\nthe exclusive rule of the aristocracy of finance was to be overthrown.\r\nWhen however, it came to a real conflict, when the people mounted the\r\nbarricades, when the National Guard stood passive, when the army\r\noffered no serious resistance, and the kingdom ran away, then the\r\nrepublic seemed self-understood. Each party interpreted it in its own\r\nsense. Won, arms in hand, by the proletariat, they put upon it the\r\nstamp of their own class, and proclaimed the social republic. Thus the\r\ngeneral purpose of modern revolutions was indicated, a purpose,\r\nhowever, that stood in most singular contradiction to every thing that,\r\nwith the material at hand, with the stage of enlightenment that the\r\nmasses had reached, and under existing circumstances and conditions,\r\ncould be immediately used. On the other hand, the claims of all the\r\nother elements, that had cooperated in the revolution of February, were\r\nrecognized by the lion’s share that they received in the government.\r\nHence, in no period do we find a more motley mixture of high-sounding\r\nphrases together with actual doubt and helplessness; of more\r\nenthusiastic reform aspirations, together with a more slavish adherence\r\nto the old routine; more seeming harmony permeating the whole of\r\nsociety together with a deeper alienation of its several elements.\r\nWhile the Parisian proletariat was still gloating over the sight of the\r\ngreat perspective that had disclosed itself to their view, and was\r\nindulging in seriously meant discussions over the social problems, the\r\nold powers of society had groomed themselves, had gathered together,\r\nhad deliberated and found an unexpected support in the mass of the\r\nnation—the peasants and small traders—all of whom threw themselves on a\r\nsudden upon the political stage, after the barriers of the July\r\nmonarchy had fallen down.\r\n\r\nThe second period, from May 4, 1848, to the end of May, 1849, is the\r\nperiod of the constitution, of the founding of the bourgeois republic\r\nimmediately after the February days, not only was the dynastic\r\nopposition surprised by the republicans, and the republicans by the\r\nSocialists, but all France was surprised by Paris. The national\r\nassembly, that met on May 4, 1848, to frame a constitution, was the\r\noutcome of the national elections; it represented the nation. It was a\r\nliving protest against the assumption of the February days, and it was\r\nintended to bring the results of the revolution back to the bourgeois\r\nmeasure. In vain did the proletariat of Paris, which forthwith\r\nunderstood the character of this national assembly, endeavor, a few\r\ndays after its meeting; on May 15, to deny its existence by force, to\r\ndissolve it, to disperse the organic apparition, in which the reacting\r\nspirit of the nation was threatening them, and thus reduce it back to\r\nits separate component parts. As is known, the 15th of May had no other\r\nresult than that of removing Blanqui and his associates, i.e. the real\r\nleaders of the proletarian party, from the public scene for the whole\r\nperiod of the cycle which we are here considering.\r\n\r\nUpon the bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe, only the bourgeois\r\nrepublic could follow; that is to say, a limited portion of the\r\nbourgeoisie having ruled under the name of the king, now the whole\r\nbourgeoisie was to rule under the name of the people. The demands of\r\nthe Parisian proletariat are utopian tom-fooleries that have to be done\r\naway with. To this declaration of the constitutional national assembly,\r\nthe Paris proletariat answers with the June insurrection, the most\r\ncolossal event in the history of European civil wars. The bourgeois\r\nrepublic won. On its side stood the aristocracy of finance, the\r\nindustrial bourgeoisie; the middle class; the small traders’ class; the\r\narmy; the slums, organized as Guarde Mobile; the intellectual\r\ncelebrities, the parsons’ class, and the rural population. On the side\r\nof the Parisian proletariat stood none but itself. Over 3,000\r\ninsurgents were massacred, after the victory 15,000 were transported\r\nwithout trial. With this defeat, the proletariat steps to the\r\nbackground on the revolutionary stage. It always seeks to crowd\r\nforward, so soon as the movement seems to acquire new impetus, but with\r\never weaker effort and ever smaller results; So soon as any of the\r\nabove lying layers of society gets into revolutionary fermentation, it\r\nenters into alliance therewith and thus shares all the defeats which\r\nthe several parties successively suffer. But these succeeding blows\r\nbecome ever weaker the more generally they are distributed over the\r\nwhole surface of society. The more important leaders of the\r\nProletariat, in its councils, and the press, fall one after another\r\nvictims of the courts, and ever more questionable figures step to the\r\nfront. It partly throws itself it upon doctrinaire experiments,\r\n“co-operative banking” and “labor exchange” schemes; in other words,\r\nmovements, in which it goes into movements in which it gives up the\r\ntask of revolutionizing the old world with its own large collective\r\nweapons and on the contrary, seeks to bring about its emancipation,\r\nbehind the back of society, in private ways, within the narrow bounds\r\nof its own class conditions, and, consequently, inevitably fails. The\r\nproletariat seems to be able neither to find again the revolutionary\r\nmagnitude within itself nor to draw new energy from the newly formed\r\nalliances until all the classes, with whom it contended in June, shall\r\nlie prostrate along with itself. But in all these defeats, the\r\nproletariat succumbs at least with the honor that attaches to great\r\nhistoric struggles; not France alone, all Europe trembles before the\r\nJune earthquake, while the successive defeats inflicted upon the higher\r\nclasses are bought so easily that they need the brazen exaggeration of\r\nthe victorious party itself to be at all able to pass muster as an\r\nevent; and these defeats become more disgraceful the further removed\r\nthe defeated party stands from the proletariat.\r\n\r\nTrue enough, the defeat of the June insurgents prepared, leveled the\r\nground, upon which the bourgeois republic could be founded and erected;\r\nbut it, at the same time, showed that there are in Europe other issues\r\nbesides that of “Republic or Monarchy.” It revealed the fact that here\r\nthe Bourgeois Republic meant the unbridled despotism of one class over\r\nanother. It proved that, with nations enjoying an older civilization,\r\nhaving developed class distinctions, modern conditions of production,\r\nan intellectual consciousness, wherein all traditions of old have been\r\ndissolved through the work of centuries, that with such countries the\r\nrepublic means only the political revolutionary form of bourgeois\r\nsociety, not its conservative form of existence, as is the case in the\r\nUnited States of America, where, true enough, the classes already\r\nexist, but have not yet acquired permanent character, are in constant\r\nflux and reflux, constantly changing their elements and yielding them\r\nup to one another where the modern means of production, instead of\r\ncoinciding with a stagnant population, rather compensate for the\r\nrelative scarcity of heads and hands; and, finally, where the\r\nfeverishly youthful life of material production, which has to\r\nappropriate a new world to itself, has so far left neither time nor\r\nopportunity to abolish the illusions of old. [#3 This was written at\r\nthe beginning of 1852.]\r\n\r\nAll classes and parties joined hands in the June days in a “Party of\r\nOrder” against the class of the proletariat, which was designated as\r\nthe “Party of Anarchy,” of Socialism, of Communism. They claimed to\r\nhave “saved” society against the “enemies of society.” They gave out\r\nthe slogans of the old social order—“Property, Family, Religion,\r\nOrder”—as the passwords for their army, and cried out to the\r\ncounter-revolutionary crusaders: “In this sign thou wilt conquer!” From\r\nthat moment on, so soon as any of the numerous parties, which had\r\nmarshaled themselves under this sign against the June insurgents,\r\ntries, in turn, to take the revolutionary field in the interest of its\r\nown class, it goes down in its turn before the cry: “Property, Family,\r\nReligion, Order.” Thus it happens that “society is saved” as often as\r\nthe circle of its ruling class is narrowed, as often as a more\r\nexclusive interest asserts itself over the general. Every demand for\r\nthe most simple bourgeois financial reform, for the most ordinary\r\nliberalism, for the most commonplace republicanism, for the flattest\r\ndemocracy, is forthwith punished as an “assault upon society,” and is\r\nbranded as “Socialism.” Finally the High Priests of “Religion and\r\nOrder” themselves are kicked off their tripods; are fetched out of\r\ntheir beds in the dark; hurried into patrol wagons, thrust into jail or\r\nsent into exile; their temple is razed to the ground, their mouths are\r\nsealed, their pen is broken, their law torn to pieces in the name of\r\nReligion, of Family, of Property, and of Order. Bourgeois, fanatic on\r\nthe point of “Order,” are shot down on their own balconies by drunken\r\nsoldiers, forfeit their family property, and their houses are bombarded\r\nfor pastime—all in the name of Property, of Family, of Religion, and of\r\nOrder. Finally, the refuse of bourgeois society constitutes the “holy\r\nphalanx of Order,” and the hero Crapulinsky makes his entry into the\r\nTuileries as the “Savior of Society.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us resume the thread of events.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Constitutional National Assembly from the June days\r\non, is the history of the supremacy and dissolution of the republican\r\nbourgeois party, the party which is known under several names of\r\n“Tricolor Republican,” “True Republican,” “Political Republican,”\r\n“Formal Republican,” etc., etc. Under the bourgeois monarchy of Louis\r\nPhilippe, this party had constituted the Official Republican\r\nOpposition, and consequently had been a recognized element in the then\r\npolitical world. It had its representatives in the Chambers, and\r\ncommanded considerable influence in the press. Its Parisian organ, the\r\n“National,” passed, in its way, for as respectable a paper as the\r\n“Journal des Debats.” This position in the constitutional monarchy\r\ncorresponded to its character. The party was not a fraction of the\r\nbourgeoisie, held together by great and common interests, and marked by\r\nspecial business requirements. It was a coterie of bourgeois with\r\nrepublican ideas—writers, lawyers, officers and civil employees, whose\r\ninfluence rested upon the personal antipathies of the country for Louis\r\nPhilippe, upon reminiscences of the old Republic, upon the republican\r\nfaith of a number of enthusiasts, and, above all, upon the spirit of\r\nFrench patriotism, whose hatred of the treaties of Vienna and of the\r\nalliance with England kept them perpetually on the alert. The\r\n“National” owed a large portion of its following under Louis Philippe\r\nto this covert imperialism, that, later under the republic, could stand\r\nup against it as a deadly competitor in the person of Louis Bonaparte.\r\nThe paper fought the aristocracy of finance just the same as did the\r\nrest of the bourgeois opposition. The polemic against the budget, which\r\nin France, was closely connected with the opposition to the aristocracy\r\nof finance, furnished too cheap a popularity and too rich a material\r\nfor Puritanical leading articles, not to be exploited. The industrial\r\nbourgeoisie was thankful to it for its servile defense of the French\r\ntariff system, which, however, the paper had taken up, more out of\r\npatriotic than economic reasons; the whole bourgeois class was thankful\r\nto it for its vicious denunciations of Communism and Socialism. For the\r\nrest, the party of the “National” was purely republican, i.e. it\r\ndemanded a republican instead of a monarchic form of bourgeois\r\ngovernment; above all, it demanded for the bourgeoisie the lion’s share\r\nof the government. As to how this transformation was to be\r\naccomplished, the party was far from being clear. What, however, was\r\nclear as day to it and was openly declared at the reform banquets\r\nduring the last days of Louis Philippe’s reign, was its unpopularity\r\nwith the democratic middle class, especially with the revolutionary\r\nproletariat. These pure republicans, as pure republicans go, were at\r\nfirst on the very point of contenting themselves with the regency of\r\nthe Duchess of Orleans, when the February revolution broke out, and\r\nwhen it gave their best known representatives a place in the\r\nprovisional government. Of course, they enjoyed from the start the\r\nconfidence of the bourgeoisie and of the majority of the Constitutional\r\nNational Assembly. The Socialist elements of the Provisional Government\r\nwere promptly excluded from the Executive Committee which the Assembly\r\nhad elected upon its convening, and the party of the “National”\r\nsubsequently utilized the outbreak of the June insurrection to dismiss\r\nthis Executive Committee also, and thus rid itself of its nearest\r\nrivals—the small traders’ class or democratic republicans\r\n(Ledru-Rollin, etc.). Cavaignac, the General of the bourgeois\r\nrepublican party, who commanded at the battle of June, stepped into the\r\nplace of the Executive Committee with a sort of dictatorial power.\r\nMarrast, former editor-in-chief of the “National”, became permanent\r\nPresident of the Constitutional National Assembly, and the\r\nSecretaryship of State, together with all the other important posts,\r\ndevolved upon the pure republicans.\r\n\r\nThe republican bourgeois party, which since long had looked upon itself\r\nas the legitimate heir of the July monarchy, thus found itself\r\nsurpassed in its own ideal; but it came to power, not as it had dreamed\r\nunder Louis Philippe, through a liberal revolt of the bourgeoisie\r\nagainst the throne, but through a grape-shot-and-canistered mutiny of\r\nthe proletariat against Capital. That which it imagined to be the most\r\nrevolutionary, came about as the most counter-revolutionary event. The\r\nfruit fell into its lap, but it fell from the Tree of Knowledge, not\r\nfrom the Tree of Life.\r\n\r\nThe exclusive power of the bourgeois republic lasted only from June 24\r\nto the 10th of December, 1848. It is summed up in the framing of a\r\nrepublican constitution and in the state of siege of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe new Constitution was in substance only a republicanized edition of\r\nthe constitutional charter of 1830. The limited suffrage of the July\r\nmonarchy, which excluded even a large portion of the bourgeoisie from\r\npolitical power, was irreconcilable with the existence of the bourgeois\r\nrepublic. The February revolution had forthwith proclaimed direct and\r\nuniversal suffrage in place of the old law. The bourgeois republic\r\ncould not annul this act. They had to content themselves with tacking\r\nto it the limitation a six months’ residence. The old organization of\r\nthe administrative law, of municipal government, of court procedures of\r\nthe army, etc., remained untouched, or, where the constitution did\r\nchange them, the change affected their index, not their subject; their\r\nname, not their substance.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable “General Staff” of the “freedoms” of 1848—personal\r\nfreedom, freedom of the press, of speech, of association and of\r\nassemblage, freedom of instruction, of religion, etc.—received a\r\nconstitutional uniform that rendered them invulnerable. Each of these\r\nfreedoms is proclaimed the absolute right of the French citizen, but\r\nalways with the gloss that it is unlimited in so far only as it be not\r\ncurtailed by the “equal rights of others,” and by the “public safety,”\r\nor by the “laws,” which are intended to effect this harmony. For\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n“Citizens have the right of association, of peaceful and unarmed\r\nassemblage, of petitioning, and of expressing their opinions through\r\nthe press or otherwise. The enjoyment of these rights has no limitation\r\nother than the equal rights of others and the public safety.” (Chap.\r\nII. of the French Constitution, Section 8.)\r\n\r\n“Education is free. The freedom of education shall be enjoyed under the\r\nconditions provided by law, and under the supervision of the State.”\r\n(Section 9.)\r\n\r\n“The domicile of the citizen is inviolable, except under the forms\r\nprescribed by law.” (Chap. I., Section 3), etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, it will be noticed, constantly alludes to future\r\norganic laws, that are to carry out the glosses, and are intended to\r\nregulate the enjoyment of these unabridged freedoms, to the end that\r\nthey collide neither with one another nor with the public safety. Later\r\non, the organic laws are called into existence by the “Friends of\r\nOrder,” and all the above named freedoms are so regulated that, in\r\ntheir enjoyment, the bourgeoisie encounter no opposition from the like\r\nrights of the other classes. Wherever the bourgeoisie wholly\r\ninterdicted these rights to “others,” or allowed them their enjoyment\r\nunder conditions that were but so many police snares, it was always\r\ndone only in the interest of the “public safety,” i. e., of the\r\nbourgeoisie, as required by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nHence it comes that both sides—the “Friends of Order,” who abolished\r\nall those freedoms, as, well as the democrats, who had demanded them\r\nall—appeal with full right to the Constitution: Each paragraph of the\r\nConstitution contains its own antithesis, its own Upper and Lower\r\nHouse—freedom as a generalization, the abolition of freedom as a\r\nspecification. Accordingly, so long as the name of freedom was\r\nrespected, and only its real enforcement was prevented in a legal way,\r\nof course the constitutional existence of freedom remained uninjured,\r\nuntouched, however completely its common existence might be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nThis Constitution, so ingeniously made invulnerable, was, however, like\r\nAchilles, vulnerable at one point: not in its heel, but in its head, or\r\nrather, in the two heads into which it ran out—the Legislative\r\nAssembly, on the one hand, and the President on the other. Run through\r\nthe Constitution and it will be found that only those paragraphs\r\nwherein the relation of the President to the Legislative Assembly is\r\ndefined, are absolute, positive, uncontradictory, undistortable.\r\n\r\nHere the bourgeois republicans were concerned in securing their own\r\nposition. Articles 45-70 of the Constitution are so framed that the\r\nNational Assembly can constitutionally remove the President, but the\r\nPresident can set aside the National Assembly only unconstitutionally,\r\nhe can set it aside only by setting aside the Constitution itself.\r\nAccordingly, by these provisions, the National Assembly challenges its\r\nown violent destruction. It not only consecrates, like the character of\r\n1830, the division of powers, but it extends this feature to an\r\nunbearably contradictory extreme. The “play of constitutional powers,”\r\nas Guizot styled the clapper-clawings between the legislative and the\r\nexecutive powers, plays permanent “vabanque” in the Constitution of\r\n1848. On the one side, 750 representatives of the people, elected and\r\nqualified for re-election by universal suffrage, who constitute an\r\nuncontrollable, indissoluble, indivisible National Assembly, a National\r\nAssembly that enjoys legislative omnipotence, that decides in the last\r\ninstance over war, peace and commercial treaties, that alone has the\r\npower to grant amnesties, and that, through its perpetuity, continually\r\nmaintains the foreground on the stage; on the other, a President, clad\r\nwith all the attributes of royalty, with the right to appoint and\r\nremove his ministers independently from the national assembly, holding\r\nin his hands all the means of executive power, the dispenser of all\r\nposts, and thereby the arbiter of at least one and a half million\r\nexistences in France, so many being dependent upon the 500,000 civil\r\nemployees and upon the officers of all grades. He has the whole armed\r\npower behind him. He enjoys the privilege of granting pardons to\r\nindividual criminals; suspending the National Guards; of removing with\r\nthe consent of the Council of State the general, cantonal and municipal\r\nCouncilmen, elected by the citizens themselves. The initiative and\r\ndirection of all negotiations with foreign countries are reserved to\r\nhim. While the Assembly itself is constantly acting upon the stage, and\r\nis exposed to the critically vulgar light of day, he leads a hidden\r\nlife in the Elysian fields, only with Article 45 of the Constitution\r\nbefore his eyes and in his heart daily calling out to him, “Frere, il\r\nfaut mourir!” [#1 Brother, you must die!] Your power expires on the\r\nsecond Sunday of the beautiful month of May, in the fourth year after\r\nyour election! The glory is then at an end; the play is not performed\r\ntwice; and, if you have any debts, see to it betimes that you pay them\r\noff with the 600,000 francs that the Constitution has set aside for\r\nyou, unless, perchance, you should prefer traveling to Clichy [#2 The\r\ndebtors’ prison.] on the second Monday of the beautiful month of May.\r\n\r\nWhile the Constitution thus clothes the President with actual power, it\r\nseeks to secure the moral power to the National Assembly. Apart from\r\nthe circumstance that it is impossible to create a moral power through\r\nlegislative paragraphs, the Constitution again neutralizes itself in\r\nthat it causes the President to be chosen by all the Frenchmen through\r\ndirect suffrage. While the votes of France are splintered to pieces\r\nupon the 750 members of the National Assembly they are here, on the\r\ncontrary, concentrated upon one individual. While each separate\r\nRepresentative represents only this or that party, this or that city,\r\nthis or that dunghill, or possibly only the necessity of electing some\r\none Seven-hundred-and-fiftieth or other, with whom neither the issue\r\nnor the man is closely considered, that one, the President, on the\r\ncontrary, is the elect of the nation, and the act of his election is\r\nthe trump card, that, the sovereign people plays out once every four\r\nyears. The elected National Assembly stands in a metaphysical, but the\r\nelected President in a personal, relation to the nation. True enough,\r\nthe National Assembly presents in its several Representatives the\r\nvarious sides of the national spirit, but, in the President, this\r\nspirit is incarnated. As against the National Assembly, the President\r\npossesses a sort of divine right, he is by the grace of the people.\r\n\r\nThetis, the sea-goddess, had prophesied to Achilles that he would die\r\nin the bloom of youth. The Constitution, which had its weak spot, like\r\nAchilles, had also, like Achilles, the presentiment that it would\r\ndepart by premature death. It was enough for the pure republicans,\r\nengaged at the work of framing a constitution, to cast a glance from\r\nthe misty heights of their ideal republic down upon the profane world\r\nin order to realize how the arrogance of the royalists, of the\r\nBonapartists, of the democrats, of the Communists, rose daily, together\r\nwith their own discredit, and in the same measure as they approached\r\nthe completion of their legislative work of art, without Thetis having\r\nfor this purpose to leave the sea and impart the secret to them. They\r\nought to outwit fate by means of constitutional artifice, through\r\nSection 111 of the Constitution, according to which every motion to\r\nrevise the Constitution had to be discussed three successive times\r\nbetween each of which a full month was to elapse and required at least\r\na three-fourths majority, with the additional proviso that not less\r\nthan 500 members of the National Assembly voted. They thereby only made\r\nthe impotent attempt, still to exercise as a parliamentary minority, to\r\nwhich in their mind’s eye they prophetically saw themselves reduced, a\r\npower, that, at this very time, when they still disposed over the\r\nparliamentary majority and over all the machinery of government, was\r\ndaily slipping from their weak hands.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Constitution entrusts itself for safe keeping, in a\r\nmelodramatic paragraph, “to the watchfulness and patriotism of the\r\nwhole French people, and of each individual Frenchman,” after having\r\njust before, in another paragraph entrusted the “watchful” and the\r\n“patriotic” themselves to the tender, inquisitorial attention of the\r\nHigh Court, instituted by itself.\r\n\r\nThat was the Constitution of 1848, which on, the 2d of December, 1851,\r\nwas not overthrown by one head, but tumbled down at the touch of a mere\r\nhat; though, true enough, that hat was a three-cornered Napoleon hat.\r\n\r\nWhile the bourgeois’ republicans were engaged in the Assembly with the\r\nwork of splicing this Constitution, of discussing and voting,\r\nCavaignac, on the outside, maintained the state of siege of Paris. The\r\nstate of siege of Paris was the midwife of the constitutional assembly,\r\nduring its republican pains of travail. When the Constitution is later\r\non swept off the earth by the bayonet, it should not be forgotten that\r\nit was by the bayonet, likewise—and the bayonet turned against the\r\npeople, at that—that it had to be protected in its mother’s womb, and\r\nthat by the bayonet it had to be planted on earth. The ancestors of\r\nthese “honest republicans” had caused their symbol, the tricolor, to\r\nmake the tour of Europe. These, in their turn also made a discovery,\r\nwhich all of itself, found its way over the whole continent, but, with\r\never renewed love, came back to France, until, by this time, if had\r\nacquired the right of citizenship in one-half of her Departments—the\r\nstate of siege. A wondrous discovery this was, periodically applied at\r\neach succeeding crisis in the course of the French revolution. But the\r\nbarrack and the bivouac, thus periodically laid on the head of French\r\nsociety, to compress her brain and reduce her to quiet; the sabre and\r\nthe musket, periodically made to perform the functions of judges and of\r\nadministrators, of guardians and of censors, of police officers and of\r\nwatchmen; the military moustache and the soldier’s jacket, periodically\r\nheralded as the highest wisdom and guiding stars of society;—were not\r\nall of these, the barrack and the bivouac, the sabre and the musket,\r\nthe moustache and the soldier’s jacket bound, in the end, to hit upon\r\nthe idea that they might as well save society once for all, by\r\nproclaiming their own regime as supreme, and relieve bourgeois society\r\nwholly of the care of ruling itself? The barrack and the bivouac, the\r\nsabre and the musket, the moustache and the soldier’s jacket were all\r\nthe more bound to hit upon this idea, seeing that they could then also\r\nexpect better cash payment for their increased deserts, while at the\r\nmerely periodic states of siege and the transitory savings of society\r\nat the behest of this or that bourgeois faction, very little solid\r\nmatter fell to them except some dead and wounded, besides some friendly\r\nbourgeois grimaces. Should not the military, finally, in and for its\r\nown interest, play the game of “state of siege,” and simultaneously\r\nbesiege the bourgeois exchanges? Moreover, it must not be forgotten,\r\nand be it observed in passing, that Col. Bernard, the same President of\r\nthe Military Committee, who, under Cavaignac, helped to deport 15,000\r\ninsurgents without trial, moves at this period again at the head of the\r\nMilitary Committees now active in Paris.\r\n\r\nAlthough the honest, the pure republicans built with the state of siege\r\nthe nursery in which the Praetorian guards of December 2, 1851, were to\r\nbe reared, they, on the other hand, deserve praise in that, instead of\r\nexaggerating the feeling of patriotism, as under Louis Philippe, now;\r\nthey themselves are in command of the national power, they crawl before\r\nforeign powers; instead of making Italy free, they allow her to be\r\nreconquered by Austrians and Neapolitans. The election of Louis\r\nBonaparte for President on December 10, 1848, put an end to the\r\ndictatorship of Cavaignac and to the constitutional assembly.\r\n\r\nIn Article 44 of the Constitution it is said “The President of the\r\nFrench Republic must never have lost his status as a French citizen.”\r\nThe first President of the French Republic, L. N. Bonaparte, had not\r\nonly lost his status as a French citizen, had not only been an English\r\nspecial constable, but was even a naturalized Swiss citizen.\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter I have explained the meaning of the election of\r\nDecember 10. I shall not here return to it. Suffice it here to say that\r\nit was a reaction of the farmers’ class, who had been expected to pay\r\nthe costs of the February revolution, against the other classes of the\r\nnation: it was a reaction of the country against the city. It met with\r\ngreat favor among the soldiers, to whom the republicans of the\r\n“National” had brought neither fame nor funds; among the great\r\nbourgeoisie, who hailed Bonaparte as a bridge to the monarchy; and\r\namong the proletarians and small traders, who hailed him as a scourge\r\nto Cavaignac. I shall later have occasion to enter closer into the\r\nrelation of the farmers to the French revolution.\r\n\r\nThe epoch between December 20, 1848, and the dissolution of the\r\nconstitutional assembly in May, 1849, embraces the history of the\r\ndownfall of the bourgeois republicans. After they had founded a\r\nrepublic for the bourgeoisie, had driven the revolutionary proletariat\r\nfrom the field and had meanwhile silenced the democratic middle class,\r\nthey are themselves shoved aside by the mass of the bourgeoisie who\r\njustly appropriate this republic as their property. This bourgeois mass\r\nwas Royalist, however. A part thereof, the large landed proprietors,\r\nhad ruled under the restoration, hence, was Legitimist; the other part,\r\nthe aristocrats of finance and the large industrial capitalists, had\r\nruled under the July monarchy, hence, was Orleanist. The high\r\nfunctionaries of the Army, of the University, of the Church, in the\r\ncivil service, of the Academy and of the press, divided themselves on\r\nboth sides, although in unequal parts. Here, in the bourgeois republic,\r\nthat bore neither the name of Bourbon, nor of Orleans, but the name of\r\nCapital, they had found the form of government under which they could\r\nall rule in common. Already the June insurrection had united them all\r\ninto a “Party of Order.” The next thing to do was to remove the\r\nbourgeois republicans who still held the seats in the National\r\nAssembly. As brutally as these pure republicans had abused their own\r\nphysical power against the people, so cowardly, low-spirited,\r\ndisheartened, broken, powerless did they yield, now when the issue was\r\nthe maintenance of their own republicanism and their own legislative\r\nrights against the Executive power and the royalists I need not here\r\nnarrate the shameful history of their dissolution. It was not a\r\ndownfall, it was extinction. Their history is at an end for all time.\r\nIn the period that follows, they figure, whether within or without the\r\nAssembly, only as memories—memories that seem again to come to life so\r\nsoon as the question is again only the word “Republic,” and as often as\r\nthe revolutionary conflict threatens to sink down to the lowest level.\r\nIn passing, I might observe that the journal which gave to this party\r\nits name, the “National,” goes over to Socialism during the following\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nBefore we close this period, we must look back upon the two powers, one\r\nof destroys the other on December 2, 1851, while, from December 20,\r\n1848, down to the departure of the constitutional assembly, they live\r\nmarital relations. We mean Louis Bonaparte, on the-one hand, on the\r\nother, the party of the allied royalists; of Order, and of the large\r\nbourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nAt the inauguration of his presidency, Bonaparte forthwith framed a\r\nministry out of the party of Order, at whose head he placed Odillon\r\nBarrot, be it noted, the old leader of the liberal wing of the\r\nparliamentary bourgeoisie. Mr. Barrot had finally hunted down a seat in\r\nthe ministry, the spook of which had been pursuing him since 1830; and\r\nwhat is more, he had the chairmanship in this ministry, although not,\r\nas he had imagined under Louis Philippe, the promoted leader of the\r\nparliamentary opposition, but with the commission to kill a parliament,\r\nand, moreover, as an ally of all his arch enemies, the Jesuits and the\r\nLegitimists. Finally he leads the bride home, but only after she has\r\nbeen prostituted. As to Bonaparte, he seemed to eclipse himself\r\ncompletely. The party of Order acted for him.\r\n\r\nImmediately at the first session of the ministry the expedition to Rome\r\nwas decided upon, which it was there agreed, was to be carried out\r\nbehind I the back of the National Assembly, and the funds for which, it\r\nwas equally agreed, were to be wrung from the Assembly under false\r\npretences. Thus the start was made with a swindle on the National\r\nAssembly, together with a secret conspiracy with the absolute foreign\r\npowers against the revolutionary Roman republic. In the same way, and\r\nwith a similar maneuver, did Bonaparte prepare his stroke of December 2\r\nagainst the royalist legislature and its constitutional republic. Let\r\nit not be forgotten that the same party, which, on December 20, 1848,\r\nconstituted Bonaparte’s ministry, constituted also, on December 2,\r\n1851, the majority of the legislative National Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn August the constitutive assembly decided not to dissolve until it\r\nhad prepared and promulgated a whole series of organic laws, intended\r\nto supplement the Constitution. The party of Order proposed to the\r\nassembly, through Representative Rateau, on January 6, 1849, to let the\r\nOrganic laws go, and rather to order its own dissolution. Not the\r\nministry alone, with Mr. Odillon Barrot at its head, but all the\r\nroyalist members of the National Assembly were also at this time\r\nhectoring to it that its dissolution was necessary for the restoration\r\nof the public credit, for the consolidation of order, to put an end to\r\nthe existing uncertain and provisional, and establish a definite state\r\nof things; they claimed that its continued existence hindered the\r\neffectiveness of the new Government, that it sought to prolong its life\r\nout of pure malice, and that the country was tired of it. Bonaparte\r\ntook notice of all these invectives hurled at the legislative power, he\r\nlearned them by heart, and, on December 21, 1851, he showed the\r\nparliamentary royalists that he had learned from them. He repeated\r\ntheir own slogans against themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Barrot ministry and the party of Order went further. They called\r\nall over France for petitions to the National Assembly in which that\r\nbody was politely requested to disappear. Thus they led the people’s\r\nunorganic masses to the fray against the National Assembly, i.e., the\r\nconstitutionally organized expression of people itself. They taught\r\nBonaparte, to appeal from the parliamentary body to the people.\r\nFinally, on January 29, 1849, the day arrived when the constitutional\r\nassembly was to decide about its own dissolution. On that day the body\r\nfound its building occupied by the military; Changarnier, the General\r\nof the party of Order, in whose hands was joined the supreme command of\r\nboth the National Guards and the regulars, held that day a great\r\nmilitary review, as though a battle were imminent; and the coalized\r\nroyalists declared threateningly to the constitutional assembly that\r\nforce would be applied if it did not act willingly. It was willing, and\r\nchaffered only for a very short respite. What else was the 29th of\r\nJanuary, 1849, than the “coup d’etat” of December 2, 1851, only\r\nexecuted by the royalists with Napoleon’s aid against the republican\r\nNational Assembly? These gentlemen did not notice, or did not want to\r\nnotice, that Napoleon utilized the 29th of January, 1849, to cause a\r\npart of the troops to file before him in front of the Tuileries, and\r\nthat he seized with avidity this very first open exercise of the\r\nmilitary against the parliamentary power in order to hint at Caligula.\r\nThe allied royalists saw only their own Changarnier.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that particularly moved the party of Order forcibly to\r\nshorten the term of the constitutional assembly were the organic laws,\r\nthe laws that were to supplement the Constitution, as, for instance,\r\nthe laws on education, on religion, etc. The allied royalists had every\r\ninterest in framing these laws themselves, and not allowing them to be\r\nframed by the already suspicious republicans. Among these organic laws,\r\nthere was, however, one on the responsibility of the President of the\r\nrepublic. In 1851 the Legislature was just engaged in framing such a\r\nlaw when Bonaparte forestalled that political stroke by his own of\r\nDecember 2. What all would not the coalized royalists have given in\r\ntheir winter parliamentary campaign of 1851, had they but found this\r\n“Responsibility law” ready made, and framed at that, by the suspicious,\r\nthe vicious republican Assembly!\r\n\r\nAfter, on January 29, 1849, the constitutive assembly had itself broken\r\nits last weapon, the Barrot ministry and the “Friends of Order”\r\nharassed it to death, left nothing undone to humiliate it, and wrung\r\nfrom its weakness, despairing of itself, laws that cost it the last\r\nvestige of respect with the public. Bonaparte, occupied with his own\r\nfixed Napoleonic idea, was audacious enough openly to exploit this\r\ndegradation of the parliamentary power: When the National Assembly, on\r\nMay 8, 1849, passed a vote of censure upon the Ministry on account of\r\nthe occupation of Civita-Vecchia by Oudinot, and ordered that the Roman\r\nexpedition be brought back to its alleged purpose, Bonaparte published\r\nthat same evening in the “Moniteur” a letter to Oudinot, in which he\r\ncongratulated him on his heroic feats, and already, in contrast with\r\nthe quill-pushing parliamentarians, posed as the generous protector of\r\nthe Army. The royalists smiled at this. They took him simply for their\r\ndupe. Finally, as Marrast, the President of the constitutional\r\nassembly, believed on a certain occasion the safety of the body to be\r\nin danger, and, resting on the Constitution, made a requisition upon a\r\nColonel, together with his regiment, the Colonel refused obedience,\r\ntook refuge behind the “discipline,” and referred Marrast to\r\nChangarnier, who scornfully sent him off with the remark that he did\r\nnot like “bayonettes intelligentes.” [#1 Intelligent bayonets] In\r\nNovember, 1851, as the coalized royalists wanted to begin the decisive\r\nstruggle with Bonaparte, they sought, by means of their notorious\r\n“Questors Bill,” to enforce the principle of the right of the President\r\nof the National Assembly to issue direct requisitions for troops. One\r\nof their Generals, Leflo, supported the motion. In vain did Changarnier\r\nvote for it, or did Thiers render homage to the cautious wisdom of the\r\nlate constitutional assembly. The Minister of War, St. Arnaud, answered\r\nhim as Changarnier had answered Marrast—and he did so amidst the\r\nplaudits of the Mountain.\r\n\r\nThus did the party of Order itself, when as yet it was not the National\r\nAssembly, when as yet it was only a Ministry, brand the parliamentary\r\nregime. And yet this party objects vociferously when the 2d of\r\nDecember, 1851, banishes that regime from France!\r\n\r\nWe wish it a happy journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 1849, the legislative National Assembly convened. On\r\nDecember 2, 1851, it was broken up. This period embraces the term of\r\nthe Constitutional or Parliamentary public.\r\n\r\nIn the first French revolution, upon the reign of the\r\nConstitutionalists succeeds that of the Girondins; and upon the reign\r\nof the Girondins follows that of the Jacobins. Each of these parties in\r\nsuccession rests upon its more advanced element. So soon as it has\r\ncarried the revolution far enough not to be able to keep pace with,\r\nmuch less march ahead of it, it is shoved aside by its more daring\r\nallies, who stand behind it, and it is sent to the guillotine. Thus the\r\nrevolution moves along an upward line.\r\n\r\nJust the reverse in 1848. The proletarian party appears as an appendage\r\nto the small traders’ or democratic party; it is betrayed by the latter\r\nand allowed to fall on April 16, May 15, and in the June days. In its\r\nturn, the democratic party leans upon the shoulders of the bourgeois\r\nrepublicans; barely do the bourgeois republicans believe themselves\r\nfirmly in power, than they shake off these troublesome associates for\r\nthe purpose of themselves leaning upon the shoulders of the party of\r\nOrder. The party of Order draws in its shoulders, lets the bourgeois\r\nrepublicans tumble down heels over head, and throws itself upon the\r\nshoulders of the armed power. Finally, still of the mind that it is\r\nsustained by the shoulders of the armed power, the party of Order\r\nnotices one fine morning that these shoulders have turned into\r\nbayonets. Each party kicks backward at those that are pushing forward,\r\nand leans forward upon those that are crowding backward; no wonder\r\nthat, in this ludicrous posture, each loses its balance, and, after\r\nhaving cut the unavoidable grimaces, breaks down amid singular\r\nsomersaults. Accordingly, the revolution moves along a downward line.\r\nIt finds itself in this retreating motion before the last\r\nFebruary-barricade is cleared away, and the first governmental\r\nauthority of the revolution has been constituted.\r\n\r\nThe period we now have before us embraces the motliest jumble of crying\r\ncontradictions: constitutionalists, who openly conspire against the\r\nConstitution; revolutionists, who admittedly are constitutional; a\r\nNational Assembly that wishes to be omnipotent yet remains\r\nparliamentary; a Mountain, that finds its occupation in submission,\r\nthat parries its present defeats with prophecies of future victories;\r\nroyalists, who constitute the “patres conscripti” of the republic, and\r\nare compelled by the situation to uphold abroad the hostile monarchic\r\nhouses, whose adherents they are, while in France they support the\r\nrepublic that they hate; an Executive power that finds its strength in\r\nits very weakness, and its dignity in the contempt that it inspires; a\r\nrepublic, that is nothing else than the combined infamy of two\r\nmonarchies—the Restoration and the July Monarchy—with an imperial\r\nlabel; unions, whose first clause is disunion; struggles, whose first\r\nlaw is in-decision; in the name of peace, barren and hollow agitation;\r\nin the name of the revolution, solemn sermonizings on peace; passions\r\nwithout truth; truths without passion; heroes without heroism; history\r\nwithout events; development, whose only moving force seems to be the\r\ncalendar, and tiresome by the constant reiteration of the same tensions\r\nand relaxes; contrasts, that seem to intensify themselves periodically,\r\nonly in order to wear themselves off and collapse without a solution;\r\npretentious efforts made for show, and bourgeois frights at the danger\r\nof the destruction of the world, simultaneous with the carrying on of\r\nthe pettiest intrigues and the performance of court comedies by the\r\nworld’s saviours, who, in their “laisser aller,” recall the Day of\r\nJudgment not so much as the days of the Fronde; the official collective\r\ngenius of France brought to shame by the artful stupidity of a single\r\nindividual; the collective will of the nation, as often as it speaks\r\nthrough the general suffrage, seeking its true expression in the\r\nprescriptive enemies of the public interests until it finally finds it\r\nin the arbitrary will of a filibuster. If ever a slice from history is\r\ndrawn black upon black, it is this. Men and events appear as reversed\r\n“Schlemihls,” [#1 The hero In Chamisso’s “Peter Schiemihi,” who loses\r\nhis own shadow.] as shadows, the bodies of which have been lost. The\r\nrevolution itself paralyzes its own apostles, and equips only its\r\nadversaries with passionate violence. When the “Red Spectre,”\r\nconstantly conjured up and exorcised by the counter-revolutionists\r\nfinally does appear, it does not appear with the Anarchist Phrygian cap\r\non its head, but in the uniform of Order, in the Red Breeches of the\r\nFrench Soldier.\r\n\r\nWe saw that the Ministry, which Bonaparte installed on December 20,\r\n1849, the day of his “Ascension,” was a ministry of the party of Order,\r\nof the Legitimist and Orleanist coalition. The Barrot-Falloux ministry\r\nhad weathered the republican constitutive convention, whose term of\r\nlife it had shortened with more or less violence, and found itself\r\nstill at the helm. Changamier, the General of the allied royalists\r\ncontinued to unite in his person the command-in-chief of the First\r\nMilitary Division and of the Parisian National Guard. Finally, the\r\ngeneral elections had secured the large majority in the National\r\nAssembly to the party of Order. Here the Deputies and Peers of Louis\r\nPhillipe met a saintly crowd of Legitimists, for whose benefit numerous\r\nballots of the nation had been converted into admission tickets to the\r\npolitical stage. The Bonapartist representatives were too thinly sowed\r\nto be able to build an independent parliamentary party. They appeared\r\nonly as “mauvaise queue” [#2 Practical joke] played upon the party of\r\nOrder. Thus the party of Order was in possession of the Government, of\r\nthe Army, and of the legislative body, in short, of the total power of\r\nthe State, morally strengthened by the general elections, that caused\r\ntheir sovereignty to appear as the will of the people, and by the\r\nsimultaneous victory of the counter-revolution on the whole continent\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nNever did party open its campaign with larger means at its disposal and\r\nunder more favorable auspices.\r\n\r\nThe shipwrecked pure republicans found themselves in the legislative\r\nNational Assembly melted down to a clique of fifty men, with the\r\nAfrican Generals Cavaignac, Lamorciere and Bedeau at its head. The\r\ngreat Opposition party was, however, formed by the Mountain. This\r\nparliamentary baptismal name was given to itself by the Social\r\nDemocratic party. It disposed of more than two hundred votes out of the\r\nseven hundred and fifty in the National Assembly, and, hence, was at\r\nleast just as powerful as any one of the three factions of the party of\r\nOrder. Its relative minority to the total royalist coalition seemed\r\ncounterbalanced by special circumstances. Not only did the Departmental\r\nelection returns show that it had gained a considerable following among\r\nthe rural population, but, furthermore, it numbered almost all the\r\nParis Deputies in its camp; the Army had, by the election of three\r\nunder-officers, made a confession of democratic faith; and the leader\r\nof the Mountain, Ledru-Rollin had in contrast to all the\r\nrepresentatives of the party of Order, been raised to the rank of the\r\n“parliamentary nobility” by five Departments, who combined their\r\nsuffrages upon him. Accordingly, in view of the inevitable collisions\r\nof the royalists among themselves, on the one hand, and of the whole\r\nparty of Order with Bonaparte, on the other, the Mountain seemed on May\r\n29,1849, to have before it all the elements of success. A fortnight\r\nlater, it had lost everything, its honor included.\r\n\r\nBefore we follow this parliamentary history any further, a few\r\nobservations are necessary, in order to avoid certain common deceptions\r\nconcerning the whole character of the epoch that lies before us.\r\nAccording to the view of the democrats, the issue, during the period of\r\nthe legislative National Assembly, was, the same as during the period\r\nof the constitutive assembly, simply the struggle between republicans\r\nand royalists; the movement itself was summed up by them in the\r\ncatch-word Reaction—night, in which all cats are grey, and allows them\r\nto drawl out their drowsy commonplaces. Indeed, at first sight, the\r\nparty of Order presents the appearance of a tangle of royalist\r\nfactions, that, not only intrigue against each other, each aiming to\r\nraise its own Pretender to the throne, and exclude the Pretender of the\r\nOpposite party, but also are all united in a common hatred for and\r\ncommon attacks against the “Republic.” On its side, the Mountain\r\nappears, in counter-distinction to the royalist conspiracy, as the\r\nrepresentative of the “Republic.” The party of Order seems constantly\r\nengaged in a “Reaction,” which, neither more nor less than in Prussia,\r\nis directed against the press, the right of association and the like,\r\nand is enforced by brutal police interventions on the part of the\r\nbureaucracy, the police and the public prosecutor—just as in Prussia;\r\nthe Mountain on the contrary, is engaged with equal assiduity in\r\nparrying these attacks, and thus in defending the “eternal rights of\r\nman”—as every so-called people’s party has more or less done for the\r\nlast hundred and fifty years. At a closer inspection, however, of the\r\nsituation and of the parties, this superficial appearance, which veils\r\nthe Class Struggle, together with the peculiar physiognomy of this\r\nperiod, vanishes wholly.\r\n\r\nLegitimists and Orleanists constituted, as said before, the two large\r\nfactions of the party of Order. What held these two factions to their\r\nrespective Pretenders, and inversely kept them apart from each other,\r\nwhat else was it but the lily and the tricolor, the House of Bourbon\r\nand the house of Orleans, different shades of royalty? Under the\r\nBourbons, Large Landed Property ruled together with its parsons and\r\nlackeys; under the Orleanist, it was the high finance, large industry,\r\nlarge commerce, i.e., Capital, with its retinue of lawyers, professors\r\nand orators. The Legitimate kingdom was but the political expression\r\nfor the hereditary rule of the landlords, as the July monarchy was bur\r\nthe political expression for the usurped rule of the bourgeois\r\nupstarts. What, accordingly, kept these two factions apart was no\r\nso-called set of principles, it was their material conditions for\r\nlife—two different sorts of property—; it was the old antagonism of the\r\nCity and the Country, the rivalry between Capital and Landed property.\r\nThat simultaneously old recollections; personal animosities, fears and\r\nhopes; prejudices and illusions; sympathies and antipathies;\r\nconvictions, faith and principles bound these factions to one House or\r\nthe other, who denies it? Upon the several forms of property, upon the\r\nsocial conditions of existence, a whole superstructure is reared of\r\nvarious and peculiarly shaped feelings, illusions, habits of thought\r\nand conceptions of life. The whole class produces and shapes these out\r\nof its material foundation and out of the corresponding social\r\nconditions. The individual unit to whom they flow through tradition and\r\neducation, may fancy that they constitute the true reasons for and\r\npremises of his conduct. Although Orleanists and Legitimists, each of\r\nthese factions, sought to make itself and the other believe that what\r\nkept the two apart was the attachment of each to its respective royal\r\nHouse; nevertheless, facts proved later that it rather was their\r\ndivided interest that forbade the union of the two royal Houses. As, in\r\nprivate life, the distinction is made between what a man thinks of\r\nhimself and says, and that which he really is and does, so, all the\r\nmore, must the phrases and notions of parties in historic struggles be\r\ndistinguished from the real organism, and their real interests, their\r\nnotions and their reality. Orleanists and Legitimists found themselves\r\nin the republic beside each other with equal claims. Each side wishing,\r\nin opposition to the other, to carry out the restoration of its own\r\nroyal House, meant nothing else than that each of the two great\r\nInterests into which the bourgeoisie is divided—Land and Capital—sought\r\nto restore its own supremacy and the subordinacy of the other. We speak\r\nof two bourgeois interests because large landed property, despite its\r\nfeudal coquetry and pride of race, has become completely bourgeois\r\nthrough the development of modern society. Thus did the Tories of\r\nEngland long fancy that they were enthusiastic for the Kingdom, the\r\nChurch and the beauties of the old English Constitution, until the day\r\nof danger wrung from them the admission that their enthusiasm was only\r\nfor Ground Rent.\r\n\r\nThe coalized royalists carried on their intrigues against each other in\r\nthe press, in Ems, in Clarmont—outside of the parliament. Behind the\r\nscenes, they don again their old Orleanist and Legitimist liveries, and\r\nconduct their old tourneys; on the public stage, however, in their\r\npublic acts, as a great parliamentary party, they dispose of their\r\nrespective royal houses with mere courtesies, adjourn “in infinitum”\r\nthe restoration of the monarchy. Their real business is transacted as\r\nParty of Order, i. e., under a Social, not a Political title; as\r\nrepresentatives of the bourgeois social system; not as knights of\r\ntraveling princesses, but as the bourgeois class against the other\r\nclasses; not as royalists against republicans. Indeed, as party of\r\nOrder they exercised a more unlimited and harder dominion over the\r\nother classes of society than ever before either under the restoration\r\nor the July monarchy-a thing possible only under the form of a\r\nparliamentary republic, because under this form alone could the two\r\nlarge divisions of the French bourgeoisie be united; in other words,\r\nonly under this form could they place on the order of business the\r\nsovereignty of their class, in lieu of the regime of a privileged\r\nfaction of the same. If, this notwithstanding, they are seen as the\r\nparty of Order to insult the republic and express their antipathy for\r\nit, it happened not out of royalist traditions only: Instinct taught\r\nthem that while, indeed, the republic completes their authority, it at\r\nthe same time undermined their social foundation, in that, without\r\nintermediary, without the mask of the crown, without being able to turn\r\naside the national interest by means of its subordinate struggles among\r\nits own conflicting elements and with the crown, the republic is\r\ncompelled to stand up sharp against the subjugated classes, and wrestle\r\nwith them. It was a sense of weakness that caused them to recoil before\r\nthe unqualified demands of their own class rule, and to retreat to the\r\nless complete, less developed, and, for that very reason, less\r\ndangerous forms of the same. As often, on the contrary, as the allied\r\nroyalists come into conflict with the Pretender who stands before\r\nthem—with Bonaparte—, as often as they believe their parliamentary\r\nomnipotence to be endangered by the Executive, in other words, as often\r\nas they must trot out the political title of their authority, they step\r\nup as Republicans, not as Royalists—and this is done from the Orleanist\r\nThiers, who warns the National Assembly that the republic divides them\r\nleast, down to Legitimist Berryer, who, on December 2, 1851, the scarf\r\nof the tricolor around him, harangues the people assembled before the\r\nMayor’s building of the Tenth Arrondissement, as a tribune in the name\r\nof the Republic; the echo, however, derisively answering back to him:\r\n“Henry V.! Henry V!” [#3 The candidate of the Bourbons, or Legitimists,\r\nfor the throne.]\r\n\r\nHowever, against the allied bourgeois, a coalition was made between the\r\nsmall traders and the workingmen—the so-called Social Democratic party.\r\nThe small traders found themselves ill rewarded after the June days of\r\n1848; they saw their material interests endangered, and the democratic\r\nguarantees, that were to uphold their interests, made doubtful. Hence,\r\nthey drew closer to the workingmen. On the other hand, their\r\nparliamentary representatives—the Mountain—, after being shoved aside\r\nduring the dictatorship of the bourgeois republicans, had, during the\r\nlast half of the term of the constitutive convention, regained their\r\nlost popularity through the struggle with Bonaparte and the royalist\r\nministers. They had made an alliance with the Socialist leaders. During\r\nFebruary, 1849, reconciliation banquets were held. A common program was\r\ndrafted, joint election committees were empanelled, and fusion\r\ncandidates were set up. The revolutionary point was thereby broken off\r\nfrom the social demands of the proletariat and a democratic turn given\r\nto them; while, from the democratic claims of the small traders’ class,\r\nthe mere political form was rubbed off and the Socialist point was\r\npushed forward. Thus came the Social Democracy about. The new Mountain,\r\nthe result of this combination, contained, with the exception of some\r\nfigures from the working class and some Socialist sectarians, the\r\nidentical elements of the old Mountain, only numerically stronger. In\r\nthe course of events it had, however, changed, together with the class\r\nthat it represented. The peculiar character of the Social Democracy is\r\nsummed up in this that democratic-republican institutions are demanded\r\nas the means, not to remove the two extremes—Capital and Wage-slavery—,\r\nbut in order to weaken their antagonism and transform them into a\r\nharmonious whole. However different the methods may be that are\r\nproposed for the accomplishment of this object, however much the object\r\nitself may be festooned with more or less revolutionary fancies, the\r\nsubstance remains the same. This substance is the transformation of\r\nsociety upon democratic lines, but a transformation within the\r\nboundaries of the small traders’ class. No one must run away with the\r\nnarrow notion that the small traders’ class means on principle to\r\nenforce a selfish class interest. It believes rather that the special\r\nconditions for its own emancipation are the general conditions under\r\nwhich alone modern society can be saved and the class struggle avoided.\r\nLikewise must we avoid running away with the notion that the Democratic\r\nRepresentatives are all “shopkeepers,” or enthuse for these. They\r\nmay—by education and individual standing—be as distant from them as\r\nheaven is from earth. That which makes them representatives of the\r\nsmall traders’ class is that they do not intellectually leap the bounds\r\nwhich that class itself does not leap in practical life; that,\r\nconsequently, they are theoretically driven to the same problems and\r\nsolutions, to which material interests and social standing practically\r\ndrive the latter. Such, in fact, is at all times the relation of the\r\n“political” and the “literary” representatives of a class to the class\r\nthey represent.\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing explanations, it goes with-out saying that, while\r\nthe Mountain is constantly wrestling for the republic and the so-called\r\n“rights of man,” neither the republic nor the “rights of man” is its\r\nreal goal, as little as an army, whose weapons it is sought to deprive\r\nit of and that defends itself, steps on the field of battle simply in\r\norder to remain in possession of implements of warfare.\r\n\r\nThe party of Order provoked the Mountain immediately upon the convening\r\nof the assembly. The bourgeoisie now felt the necessity of disposing of\r\nthe democratic small traders’ class, just as a year before it had\r\nunderstood the necessity of putting an end to the revolutionary\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\nBut the position of the foe had changed. The strength of the\r\nproletarian party was on the streets; that of the small traders’ class\r\nwas in the National Assembly itself. The point was, accordingly, to\r\nwheedle them out of the National Assembly into the street, and to have\r\nthem break their parliamentary power themselves, before time and\r\nopportunity could consolidate them. The Mountain jumped with loose\r\nreins into the trap.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of Rome by the French troops was the bait thrown at the\r\nMountain. It violated Article V. of the Constitution, which forbade the\r\nFrench republic to use its forces against the liberties of other\r\nnations; besides, Article IV. forbade all declaration of war by the\r\nExecutive without the consent of the National Assembly; furthermore,\r\nthe constitutive assembly had censured the Roman expedition by its\r\nresolution of May 8. Upon these grounds, Ledru-Rollin submitted on June\r\n11, 1849, a motion impeaching Bonaparte and his Ministers. Instigated\r\nby the wasp-stings of Thiers, he even allowed himself to be carried\r\naway to the point of threatening to defend the Constitution by all\r\nmeans, even arms in hand. The Mountain rose as one man, and repeated\r\nthe challenge. On June 12, the National Assembly rejected the notion to\r\nimpeach, and the Mountain left the parliament. The events of June 13\r\nare known: the proclamation by a part of the Mountain pronouncing\r\nNapoleon and his Ministers “outside the pale of the Constitution”; the\r\nstreet parades of the democratic National Guards, who, unarmed as they\r\nwere, flew apart at contact with the troops of Changarnier; etc., etc.\r\nPart of the Mountain fled abroad, another part was assigned to the High\r\nCourt of Bourges, and a parliamentary regulation placed the rest under\r\nthe school-master supervision of the President of the National\r\nAssembly. Paris was again put under a state of siege; and the\r\ndemocratic portion of the National Guards was disbanded. Thus the\r\ninfluence of the Mountain in parliament was broken, together with the\r\npower; of the small traders’ class in Paris.\r\n\r\nLyons, where the 13th of June had given the signal to a bloody labor\r\nuprising, was, together with the five surrounding Departments, likewise\r\npronounced in state of siege, a condition that continues down to this\r\nmoment. [#4 January, 1852]\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the Mountain had left its vanguard in the lurch by refusing\r\ntheir signatures to the proclamation; the press had deserted: only two\r\npapers dared to publish the pronunciamento; the small traders had\r\nbetrayed their Representatives: the National Guards stayed away, or,\r\nwhere they did turn up, hindered the raising of barricades; the\r\nRepresentatives had duped the small traders: nowhere were the alleged\r\naffiliated members from the Army to be seen; finally, instead of\r\ngathering strength from them, the democratic party had infected the\r\nproletariat with its own weakness, and, as usual with democratic feats,\r\nthe leaders had the satisfaction of charging “their people” with\r\ndesertion, and the people had the satisfaction of charging their\r\nleaders with fraud.\r\n\r\nSeldom was an act announced with greater noise than the campaign\r\ncontemplated by the Mountain; seldom was an event trumpeted ahead with\r\nmore certainty and longer beforehand than the “inevitable victory of\r\nthe democracy.” This is evident: the democrats believe in the trombones\r\nbefore whose blasts the walls of Jericho fall together; as often as\r\nthey stand before the walls of despotism, they seek to imitate the\r\nmiracle. If the Mountain wished to win in parliament, it should not\r\nappeal to arms; if it called to arms in parliament, it should not\r\nconduct itself parliamentarily on the street; if the friendly\r\ndemonstration was meant seriously, it was silly not to foresee that it\r\nwould meet with a warlike reception; if it was intended for actual war,\r\nit was rather original to lay aside the weapons with which war had to\r\nbe conducted. But the revolutionary threats of the middle class and of\r\ntheir democratic representatives are mere attempts to frighten an\r\nadversary; when they have run themselves into a blind alley, when they\r\nhave sufficiently compromised themselves and are compelled to execute\r\ntheir threats, the thing is done in a hesitating manner that avoids\r\nnothing so much as the means to the end, and catches at pretexts to\r\nsuccumb. The bray of the overture, that announces the fray, is lost in\r\na timid growl so soon as this is to start; the actors cease to take\r\nthemselves seriously, and the performance falls flat like an inflated\r\nballoon that is pricked with a needle.\r\n\r\nNo party exaggerates to itself the means at its disposal more than the\r\ndemocratic, none deceives itself with greater heedlessness on the\r\nsituation. A part of the Army voted for it, thereupon the Mountain is\r\nof the opinion that the Army would revolt in its favor. And by what\r\noccasion? By an occasion, that, from the standpoint of the troops,\r\nmeant nothing else than that the revolutionary soldiers should take the\r\npart of the soldiers of Rome against French soldiers. On the other\r\nhand, the memory of June, 1848, was still too fresh not to keep alive a\r\ndeep aversion on the part of the proletariat towards the National\r\nGuard, and a strong feeling of mistrust on the part of the leaders of\r\nthe secret societies for the democratic leaders. In order to balance\r\nthese differences, great common interests at stake were needed. The\r\nviolation of an abstract constitutional paragraph could not supply such\r\ninterests. Had not the constitution been repeatedly violated, according\r\nto the assurances of the democrats themselves? Had not the most popular\r\npapers branded them as a counter-revolutionary artifice? But the\r\ndemocrat—by reason of his representing the middle class, that is to\r\nsay, a Transition Class, in which the interests of two other classes\r\nare mutually dulled—, imagines himself above all class contrast. The\r\ndemocrats grant that opposed to them stands a privileged class, but\r\nthey, together with the whole remaining mass of the nation, constitute\r\nthe “PEOPLE.” What they represent is the “people’s rights”; their\r\ninterests are the “people’s interests.” Hence, they do not consider\r\nthat, at an impending struggle, they need to examine the interests and\r\nattitude of the different classes. They need not too seriously weigh\r\ntheir own means. All they have to do is to give the signal in order to\r\nhave the “people” fall upon the “oppressors” with all its inexhaustible\r\nresources. If, thereupon, in the execution, their interests turn out to\r\nbe uninteresting, and their power to be impotence, it is ascribed\r\neither to depraved sophists, who split up the “undivisible people” into\r\nseveral hostile camps; or to the army being too far brutalized and\r\nblinded to appreciate the pure aims of the democracy as its own best;\r\nor to some detail in the execution that wrecks the whole plan; or,\r\nfinally, to an unforeseen accident that spoiled the game this time. At\r\nall events, the democrat comes out of the disgraceful defeat as\r\nimmaculate as he went innocently into it, and with the refreshed\r\nconviction that he must win; not that he himself and his party must\r\ngive up their old standpoint, but that, on the contrary, conditions\r\nmust come to his aid.\r\n\r\nFor all this, one must not picture to himself the decimated, broken,\r\nand, by the new parliamentary regulation, humbled Mountain altogether\r\ntoo unhappy. If June 13 removed its leaders, it, on the other hand,\r\nmade room for new ones of inferior capacity, who are flattered by their\r\nnew position. If their impotence in parliament could no longer be\r\ndoubted, they were now justified to limit their activity to outbursts\r\nof moral indignation. If the party of Order pretended to see in them,\r\nas the last official representatives of the revolution, all the horrors\r\nof anarchy incarnated, they were free to appear all the more flat and\r\nmodest in reality. Over June 13 they consoled themselves with the\r\nprofound expression: “If they but dare to assail universal suffrage . .\r\n. then . . . then we will show who we are!” Nous verrons. [#5 We shall\r\nsee.]\r\n\r\nAs to the “Mountaineers,” who had fled abroad, it suffices here to say\r\nthat Ledru-Rollin—he having accomplished the feat of hopelessly\r\nruining, in barely a fortnight, the powerful party at whose head he\r\nstood—, found himself called upon to build up a French government “in\r\npartibus;” that his figure, at a distance, removed from the field of\r\naction, seemed to gain in size in the measure that the level of the\r\nrevolution sank and the official prominences of official France became\r\nmore and more dwarfish; that he could figure as republican Pretender\r\nfor 1852, and periodically issued to the Wallachians and other peoples\r\ncirculars in which “despot of the continent” is threatened with the\r\nfeats that he and his allies had in contemplation. Was Proudhon wholly\r\nwrong when he cried out to these gentlemen: “Vous n’êtes que des\r\nblaqueurs”? [#6 You are nothing but fakirs.]\r\n\r\nThe party of Order had, on June 13, not only broken up the Mountain, it\r\nhad also established the Subordination of the Constitution to the\r\nMajority Decisions of the National Assembly. So, indeed, did the\r\nrepublic understand it, to—wit, that the bourgeois ruled here in\r\nparliamentary form, without, as in the monarchy, finding a check in the\r\nveto of the Executive power, or the liability of parliament to\r\ndissolution. It was a “parliamentary republic,” as Thiers styled it.\r\nBut if, on June 13, the bourgeoisie secured its omnipotence within the\r\nparliament building, did it not also strike the parliament itself, as\r\nagainst the Executive and the people, with incurable weakness by\r\nexcluding its most popular part? By giving up numerous Deputies,\r\nwithout further ceremony to the mercies of the public prosecutor, it\r\nabolished its own parliamentary inviolability. The humiliating\r\nregulation, that it subjected the Mountain to, raised the President of\r\nthe republic in the same measure that it lowered the individual\r\nRepresentatives of the people. By branding an insurrection in defense\r\nof the Constitution as anarchy, and as a deed looking to the overthrow\r\nof society, it interdicted to itself all appeal to insurrection\r\nwhenever the Executive should violate the Constitution against it. And,\r\nindeed, the irony of history wills it that the very General, who by\r\norder of Bonaparte bombarded Rome, and thus gave the immediate occasion\r\nto the constitutional riot of June 13, that Oudinot, on December 22,\r\n1851, is the one imploringly and vainly to be offered to the people by\r\nthe party of Order as the General of the Constitution. Another hero of\r\nJune 13, Vieyra, who earned praise from the tribune of the National\r\nAssembly for the brutalities that he had committed in the democratic\r\nnewspaper offices at the head of a gang of National Guards in the hire\r\nof the high finance—this identical Vieyra was initiated in the\r\nconspiracy of Bonaparte, and contributed materially in cutting off all\r\nprotection that could come to the National Assembly, in the hour of its\r\nagony, from the side of the National Guard.\r\n\r\nJune 13 had still another meaning. The Mountain had wanted to place\r\nBonaparte under charges. Their defeat was, accordingly, a direct\r\nvictory of Bonaparte; it was his personal triumph over his democratic\r\nenemies. The party of Order fought for the victory, Bonaparte needed\r\nonly to pocket it. He did so. On June 14, a proclamation was to be read\r\non the walls of Paris wherein the President, as it were, without his\r\nconnivance, against his will, driven by the mere force of\r\ncircumstances, steps forward from his cloisterly seclusion like\r\nmisjudged virtue, complains of the calumnies of his antagonists, and,\r\nwhile seeming to identify his own person with the cause of order,\r\nrather identifies the cause of order with his own person. Besides this,\r\nthe National Assembly had subsequently approved the expedition against\r\nRome; Bonaparte, however, had taken the initiative in the affair. After\r\nhe had led the High Priest Samuel back into the Vatican, he could hope\r\nas King David to occupy the Tuileries. He had won the parson-interests\r\nover to himself.\r\n\r\nThe riot of June 13 limited itself, as we have seen, to a peaceful\r\nstreet procession. There were, consequently, no laurels to be won from\r\nit. Nevertheless, in these days, poor in heroes and events, the party\r\nof Order converted this bloodless battle into a second Austerlitz.\r\nTribune and press lauded the army as the power of order against the\r\npopular multitude, and the impotence of anarchy; and Changarnier as the\r\n“bulwark of society”—a mystification that he finally believed in\r\nhimself. Underhand, however, the corps that seemed doubtful were\r\nremoved from Paris; the regiments whose suffrage had turned out most\r\ndemocratic were banished from France to Algiers the restless heads\r\namong the troops were consigned to penal quarters; finally, the\r\nshutting out of the press from the barracks, and of the barracks from\r\ncontact with the citizens was systematically carried out.\r\n\r\nWe stand here at the critical turning point in the history of the\r\nFrench National Guard. In 1830, it had decided the downfall of the\r\nrestoration. Under Louis Philippe, every riot failed, at which the\r\nNational Guard stood on the side of the troops. When, in the February\r\ndays of 1848, it showed itself passive against the uprising and\r\ndoubtful toward Louis Philippe himself, he gave himself up for lost.\r\nThus the conviction cast root that a revolution could not win without,\r\nnor the Army against the National Guard. This was the superstitious\r\nfaith of the Army in bourgeois omnipotence. The June days of 1548, when\r\nthe whole National Guard, jointly with the regular troops, threw down\r\nthe insurrection, had confirmed the superstition. After the\r\ninauguration of Bonaparte’s administration, the position of the\r\nNational Guard sank somewhat through the unconstitutional joining of\r\ntheir command with the command of the First Military Division in the\r\nperson of Changarnier.\r\n\r\nAs the command of the National Guard appeared here merely an attribute\r\nof the military commander-in-chief, so did the Guard itself appear only\r\nas an appendage of the regular troops. Finally, on June 13, the\r\nNational Guard was broken up, not through its partial dissolution only,\r\nthat from that date forward was periodically repeated at all points of\r\nFrance, leaving only wrecks of its former self behind. The\r\ndemonstration of June 13 was, above all, a demonstration of the\r\nNational Guards. True, they had not carried their arms, but they had\r\ncarried their uniforms against the Army—and the talisman lay just in\r\nthese uniforms. The Army then learned that this uniform was but a\r\nwoolen rag, like any other. The spell was broken. In the June days of\r\n1848, bourgeoisie and small traders were united as National Guard with\r\nthe Army against the proletariat; on June 13, 1849, the bourgeoisie had\r\nthe small traders’ National Guard broken up; on December 2, 1851, the\r\nNational Guard of the bourgeoisie itself vanished, and Bonaparte\r\nattested the fact when he subsequently signed the decree for its\r\ndisbandment. Thus the bourgeoisie had itself broken its last weapon\r\nagainst the army, from the moment when the small traders’ class no\r\nlonger stood as a vassal behind, but as a rebel before it; indeed, it\r\nwas bound to do so, as it was bound to destroy with its own hand all\r\nits means of defence against absolutism, so soon as itself was\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the party of Order celebrated the recovery of a power\r\nthat seemed lost in 1848 only in order that, freed from its trammels in\r\n1849, it be found again through invectives against the republic and the\r\nConstitution; through the malediction of all future, present and past\r\nrevolutions, that one included which its own leaders had made; and,\r\nfinally, in laws by which the press was gagged, the right of\r\nassociation destroyed, and the stage of siege regulated as an organic\r\ninstitution. The National Assembly then adjourned from the middle of\r\nAugust to the middle of October, after it had appointed a Permanent\r\nCommittee for the period of its absence. During these vacations, the\r\nLegitimists intrigued with Ems; the Orleanists with Claremont;\r\nBonaparte through princely excursions; the Departmental Councilmen in\r\nconferences over the revision of the Constitution;—occurrences, all of\r\nwhich recurred regularly at the periodical vacations of the National\r\nAssembly, and upon which I shall not enter until they have matured into\r\nevents. Be it here only observed that the National Assembly was\r\nimpolitic in vanishing from the stage for long intervals, and leaving\r\nin view, at the head of the republic, only one, however sorry,\r\nfigure—Louis Bonaparte’s—, while, to the public scandal, the party of\r\nOrder broke up into its own royalist component parts, that pursued\r\ntheir conflicting aspirations after the restoration. As often as,\r\nduring these vacations the confusing noise of the parliament was\r\nhushed, and its body was dissolved in the nation, it was unmistakably\r\nshown that only one thing was still wanting to complete the true figure\r\nof the republic: to make the vacation of the National Assembly\r\npermanent, and substitute its inscription—“Liberty, Equality,\r\nFraternity”—by the unequivocal words, “Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly reconvened in the middle of October. On November\r\n1, Bonaparte surprised it with a message, in which he announced the\r\ndismissal of the Barrot-Falloux Ministry, and the framing of a new.\r\nNever have lackeys been chased from service with less ceremony than\r\nBonaparte did his ministers. The kicks, that were eventually destined\r\nfor the National Assembly, Barrot \u0026 Company received in the meantime.\r\n\r\nThe Barrot Ministry was, as we have seen, composed of Legitimists and\r\nOrleanists; it was a Ministry of the party of Order. Bonaparte needed\r\nthat Ministry in order to dissolve the republican constituent assembly,\r\nto effect the expedition against Rome, and to break up the democratic\r\nparty. He had seemingly eclipsed himself behind this Ministry, yielded\r\nthe reins to the hands of the party of Order, and assumed the modest\r\nmask, which, under Louis Philippe, had been worn by the responsible\r\noverseer of the newspapers—the mask of “homme de paille.” [#1 Man of\r\nstraw] Now he threw off the mask, it being no longer the light curtain\r\nbehind which he could conceal, but the Iron Mask, which prevented him\r\nfrom revealing his own physiognomy. He had instituted the Barrot\r\nMinistry in order to break up the republican National Assembly in the\r\nname of the party of Order; he now dismissed it in order to declare his\r\nown name independent of the parliament of the party of Order.\r\n\r\nThere was no want of plausible pretexts for this dismissal. The Barrot\r\nMinistry had neglected even the forms of decency that would have\r\nallowed the president of the republic to appear as a power along with\r\nthe National Assembly. For instance, during the vacation of the\r\nNational Assembly, Bonaparte published a letter to Edgar Ney, in which\r\nhe seemed to disapprove the liberal attitude of the Pope, just as, in\r\nopposition to the constitutive assembly, he had published a letter, in\r\nwhich he praised Oudinot for his attack upon the Roman republic; when\r\nthe National Assembly came to vote on the budget for the Roman\r\nexpedition, Victor Hugo, out of pretended liberalism, brought up that\r\nletter for discussion; the party of Order drowned this notion of\r\nBonaparte’s under exclamations of contempt and incredulity as though\r\nnotions of Bonaparte could not possibly have any political weight;—and\r\nnone of the Ministers took up the gauntlet for him. On another\r\noccasion, Barrot, with his well-known hollow pathos, dropped, from the\r\nspeakers’ tribune in the Assembly, words of indignation upon the\r\n“abominable machinations,” which, according to him, went on in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the President. Finally, while the Ministry\r\nobtained from the National Assembly a widow’s pension for the Duchess\r\nof Orleans, it denied every motion to raise the Presidential civil\r\nlist;—and, in Bonaparte, be it always remembered, the Imperial\r\nPretender was so closely blended with the impecunious adventurer, that\r\nthe great idea of his being destined to restore the Empire was ever\r\nsupplemented by that other, to-wit, that the French people was destined\r\nto pay his debts.\r\n\r\nThe Barrot-Falloux Ministry was the first and last parliamentary\r\nMinistry that Bonaparte called into life. Its dismissal marks,\r\naccordingly, a decisive period. With the Ministry, the party of Order\r\nlost, never to regain, an indispensable post to the maintenance of the\r\nparliamentary regime,—the handle to the Executive power. It is readily\r\nunderstood that, in a country like France, where the Executive disposes\r\nover an army of more than half a million office-holders, and,\r\nconsequently, keeps permanently a large mass of interests and\r\nexistences in the completest dependence upon itself; where the\r\nGovernment surrounds, controls, regulates, supervises and guards\r\nsociety, from its mightiest acts of national life, down to its most\r\ninsignificant motions; from its common life, down to the private life\r\nof each individual; where, due to such extraordinary centralization,\r\nthis body of parasites acquires a ubiquity and omniscience, a quickened\r\ncapacity for motion and rapidity that finds an analogue only in the\r\nhelpless lack of self-reliance, in the unstrung weakness of the body\r\nsocial itself;—that in such a country the National Assembly lost, with\r\nthe control of the ministerial posts, all real influence; unless it\r\nsimultaneously simplified the administration; if possible, reduced the\r\narmy of office-holders; and, finally, allowed society and public\r\nopinion to establish its own organs, independent of government\r\ncensorship. But the Material Interest of the French bourgeoisie is most\r\nintimately bound up in maintenance of just such a large and extensively\r\nramified governmental machine. There the bourgeoisie provides for its\r\nown superfluous membership; and supplies, in the shape of government\r\nsalaries, what it can not pocket in the form of profit, interest, rent\r\nand fees. On the other hand, its Political Interests daily compel it to\r\nincrease the power of repression, i.e., the means and the personnel of\r\nthe government; it is at the same time forced to conduct an\r\nuninterrupted warfare against public opinion, and, full of suspicion,\r\nto hamstring and lame the independent organs of society—whenever it\r\ndoes not succeed in amputating them wholly. Thus the bourgeoisie of\r\nFrance was forced by its own class attitude, on the one hand, to\r\ndestroy the conditions for all parliamentary power, its own included,\r\nand, on the other, to render irresistible the Executive power that\r\nstood hostile to it.\r\n\r\nThe new Ministry was called the d’Hautpoul Ministry. Not that General\r\nd’Hautpoul had gained the rank of Ministerial President. Along with\r\nBarrot, Bonaparte abolished this dignity, which, it must be granted,\r\ncondemned the President of the republic to the legal nothingness of a\r\nconstitutional kind, of a constitutional king at that, without throne\r\nand crown, without sceptre and without sword, without irresponsibility,\r\nwithout the imperishable possession of the highest dignity in the\r\nState, and, what was most untoward of all—without a civil list. The\r\nd’Hautpoul Ministry numbered only one man of parliamentary reputation,\r\nthe Jew Fould, one of the most notorious members of the high finance.\r\nTo him fell the portfolio of finance. Turn to the Paris stock\r\nquotations, and it will be found that from November 1, 1849, French\r\nstocks fall and rise with the falling and rising of the Bonapartist\r\nshares. While Bonaparte had thus found his ally in the Bourse, he at\r\nthe same time took possession of the Police through the appointment of\r\nCarlier as Prefect of Police.\r\n\r\nBut the consequences of the change of Ministry could reveal themselves\r\nonly in the course of events. So far, Bonaparte had taken only one step\r\nforward, to be all the more glaringly driven back. Upon his harsh\r\nmessage, followed the most servile declarations of submissiveness to\r\nthe National Assembly. As often as the Ministers made timid attempts to\r\nintroduce his own personal hobbies as bills, they themselves seemed\r\nunwilling and compelled only by their position to run the comic\r\nerrands, of whose futility they were convinced in advance. As often as\r\nBonaparte blabbed out his plans behind the backs of his Ministers, and\r\nsported his “idees napoleoniennes,” [#2 Napoleonic ideas.] his own\r\nMinisters disavowed him from the speakers’ tribune in the National\r\nAssembly. His aspirations after usurpation seemed to become audible\r\nonly to the end that the ironical laughter of his adversaries should\r\nnot die out. He deported himself like an unappreciated genius, whom the\r\nworld takes for a simpleton. Never did lie enjoy in fuller measure the\r\ncontempt of all classes than at this period. Never did the bourgeoisie\r\nrule more absolutely; never did it more boastfully display the insignia\r\nof sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is not here my purpose to write the history of its legislative\r\nactivity, which is summed up in two laws passed during this period: the\r\nlaw reestablishing the duty on wine, and the laws on education, to\r\nsuppress infidelity. While the drinking of wine was made difficult to\r\nthe Frenchmen, all the more bounteously was the water of pure life\r\npoured out to them. Although in the law on the duty on wine the\r\nbourgeoisie declares the old hated French tariff system to be\r\ninviolable, it sought, by means of the laws on education, to secure the\r\nold good will of the masses that made the former bearable. One wonders\r\nto see the Orleanists, the liberal bourgeois, these old apostles of\r\nVoltarianism and of eclectic philosophy, entrusting the supervision of\r\nthe French intellect to their hereditary enemies, the Jesuits. But,\r\nwhile Orleanists and Legitimists could part company on the question of\r\nthe Pretender to the crown, they understood full well that their joint\r\nreign dictated the joining of the means of oppression of two distinct\r\nepochs; that the means of subjugation of the July monarchy had to be\r\nsupplemented with and strengthened by the means of subjugation of the\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\nThe farmers, deceived in all their expectations, more than ever ground\r\ndown by the law scale of the price of corn, on the one hand, and, on\r\nthe other, by the growing load of taxation and mortgages, began to stir\r\nin the Departments. They were answered by the systematic baiting of the\r\nschool masters, whom the Government subjected to the clergy; by the\r\nsystematic baiting of the Mayors, whom it subjected to the Prefects;\r\nand by a system of espionage to which all were subjected. In Paris and\r\nthe large towns, the reaction itself carries the physiognomy of its own\r\nepoch; it irritates more than it cows; in the country, it becomes low,\r\nmoan, petty, tiresome, vexatious,—in a word, it becomes “gensdarme.” It\r\nis easily understood how three years of the gensdarme regime,\r\nsanctified by the regime of the clergyman, was bound to demoralize\r\nunripe masses.\r\n\r\nWhatever the mass of passion and declamation, that the party of Order\r\nexpended from the speakers’ tribune in the National Assembly against\r\nthe minority, its speech remained monosyllabic, like that of the\r\nChristian, whose speech was to be “Aye, aye; nay, nay.” It was\r\nmonosyllabic, whether from the tribune or the press; dull as a\r\nconundrum, whose solution is known beforehand. Whether the question was\r\nthe right of petition or the duty on wine, the liberty of the press or\r\nfree trade, clubs or municipal laws, protection of individual freedom\r\nor the regulation of national economy, the slogan returns ever again,\r\nthe theme is monotonously the same, the verdict is ever ready and\r\nunchanged: Socialism! Even bourgeois liberalism is pronounced\r\nsocialistic; socialistic, alike, is pronounced popular education; and,\r\nlikewise, socialistic national financial reform. It was socialistic to\r\nbuild a railroad where already a canal was; and it was socialistic to\r\ndefend oneself with a stick when attacked with a sword.\r\n\r\nThis was not a mere form of speech, a fashion, nor yet party tactics.\r\nThe bourgeoisie perceives correctly that all the weapons, which it\r\nforged against feudalism, turn their edges against itself; that all the\r\nmeans of education, which it brought forth, rebel against its own\r\ncivilization; that all the gods, which it made, have fallen away from\r\nit. It understands that all its so-called citizens’ rights and\r\nprogressive organs assail and menace its class rule, both in its social\r\nfoundation and its political superstructure—consequently, have become\r\n“socialistic.” It justly scents in this menace and assault the secret\r\nof Socialism, whose meaning and tendency it estimates more correctly\r\nthan the spurious, so-called Socialism, is capable of estimating\r\nitself, and which, consequently, is unable to understand how it is that\r\nthe bourgeoisie obdurately shuts up its ears to it, alike whether it\r\nsentimentally whines about the sufferings of humanity; or announces in\r\nChristian style the millennium and universal brotherhood; or twaddles\r\nhumanistically about the soul, culture and freedom; or doctrinally\r\nmatches out a system of harmony and wellbeing for all classes. What,\r\nhowever, the bourgeoisie does not understand is the consequence that\r\nits own parliamentary regime, its own political reign, is also of\r\nnecessity bound to fall under the general ban of “socialistic.” So long\r\nas the rule of the bourgeoisie is not fully organized, has not acquired\r\nits purely political character, the contrast with the other classes\r\ncannot come into view in all its sharpness; and, where it does come\r\ninto view, it cannot take that dangerous turn that converts every\r\nconflict with the Government into a conflict with Capital. When,\r\nhowever, the French bourgeoisie began to realize in every pulsation of\r\nsociety a menace to “peace,” how could it, at the head of society,\r\npretend to uphold the regime of unrest, its own regime, the\r\nparliamentary regime, which, according to the expression of one of its\r\nown orators, lives in struggle, and through struggle? The parliamentary\r\nregime lives on discussion,—how can it forbid discussion? Every single\r\ninterest, every single social institution is there converted into\r\ngeneral thoughts, is treated as a thought,—how could any interest or\r\ninstitution claim to be above thought, and impose itself as an article\r\nof faith? The orators’ conflict in the tribune calls forth the conflict\r\nof the rowdies in the press the debating club in parliament is\r\nnecessarily supplemented by debating clubs in the salons and the\r\nbarrooms; the representatives, who are constantly appealing to popular\r\nopinion, justify popular opinion in expressing its real opinion in\r\npetitions. The parliamentary regime leaves everything to the decision\r\nof majorities,—how can the large majorities beyond parliament be\r\nexpected not to wish to decide? If, from above, they hear the fiddle\r\nscreeching, what else is to be expected than that those below should\r\ndance?\r\n\r\nAccordingly, by now persecuting as Socialist what formerly it had\r\ncelebrated as Liberal, the bourgeoisie admits that its own interest\r\norders it to raise itself above the danger of self government; that, in\r\norder to restore rest to the land, its own bourgeois parliament must,\r\nbefore all, be brought to rest; that, in order to preserve its social\r\npower unhurt, its political power must be broken; that the private\r\nbourgeois can continue to exploit the other classes and rejoice in\r\n“property,” “family,” “religion” and “order” only under the condition\r\nthat his own class be condemned to the same political nullity of the\r\nother classes, that, in order to save their purse, the crown must be\r\nknocked off their heads, and the sword that was to shield them, must at\r\nthe same time be hung over their heads as a sword of Damocles.\r\n\r\nIn the domain of general bourgeois interests, the National Assembly\r\nproved itself so barren, that, for instance, the discussion over the\r\nParis-Avignon railroad, opened in the winter of 1850, was not yet ripe\r\nfor a vote on December 2, 1851. Wherever it did not oppress or was\r\nreactionary, the bourgeoisie was smitten with incurable barrenness.\r\n\r\nWhile Bonaparte’s Ministry either sought to take the initiative of laws\r\nin the spirit of the party of Order, or even exaggerated their severity\r\nin their enforcement and administration, he, on his part, sought to win\r\npopularity by means of childishly silly propositions, to exhibit the\r\ncontrast between himself and the National Assembly, and to hint at a\r\nsecret plan, held in reserve and only through circumstances temporarily\r\nprevented from disclosing its hidden treasures to the French people. Of\r\nthis nature was the proposition to decree a daily extra pay of four\r\nsous to the under-officers; so, likewise, the proposition for a “word\r\nof honor” loan bank for working-men. To have money given and money\r\nborrowed—that was the perspective that he hoped to cajole the masses\r\nwith. Presents and loans—to that was limited the financial wisdom of\r\nthe slums, the high as well as the low; to that were limited the\r\nsprings which Bonaparte knew how to set in motion. Never did Pretender\r\nspeculate more dully upon the dullness of the masses.\r\n\r\nAgain and again did the National Assembly fly into a passion at these\r\nunmistakable attempts to win popularity at its expense, and at the\r\ngrowing danger that this adventurer, lashed on by debts and\r\nunrestrained by reputation, might venture upon some desperate act. The\r\nstrained relations between the party of Order and the President had\r\ntaken on a threatening aspect, when an unforeseen event threw him back,\r\nrueful into its arms. We mean the supplementary elections of March,\r\n1850. These elections took place to fill the vacancies created in the\r\nNational Assembly, after June 13, by imprisonment and exile. Paris\r\nelected only Social-Democratic candidates; it even united the largest\r\nvote upon one of the insurgents of June, 1848,—Deflotte. In this way\r\nthe small traders’ world of Paris, now allied with the proletariat,\r\nrevenged itself for the defeat of June 13, 1849. It seemed to have\r\ndisappeared from the field of battle at the hour of danger only to step\r\non it again at a more favorable opportunity, with increased forces for\r\nthe fray, and with a bolder war cry. A circumstance seemed to heighten\r\nthe danger of this electoral victory. The Army voted in Paris for a\r\nJune insurgent against Lahitte, a Minister of Bonaparte’s, and, in the\r\nDepartments, mostly for the candidates of the Mountain, who, there\r\nalso, although not as decisively as in Paris, maintained the upper hand\r\nover their adversaries.\r\n\r\nBonaparte suddenly saw himself again face to face with the revolution.\r\nAs on January 29, 1849, as on June 13, 1849, on May 10, 1850, he\r\nvanished again behind the party of Order. He bent low; he timidly\r\napologized; he offered to appoint any Ministry whatever at the behest\r\nof the parliamentary majority; he even implored the Orleanist and\r\nLegitimist party leaders—the Thiers, Berryers, Broglies, Moles, in\r\nshort, the so-called burgraves—to take hold of the helm of State in\r\nperson. The party of Order did not know how to utilize this\r\nopportunity, that was never to return. Instead of boldly taking\r\npossession of the proffered power, it did not even force Bonaparte to\r\nrestore the Ministry dismissed on November 1; it contented itself with\r\nhumiliating him with its pardon, and with affiliating Mr. Baroche to\r\nthe d’Hautpoul Ministry. This Baroche had, as Public Prosecutor,\r\nstormed before the High Court at Bourges, once against the\r\nrevolutionists of May 15, another time against the Democrats of June\r\n13, both times on the charge of “attentats” against the National\r\nAssembly. None of Bonaparte’s Ministers contributed later more towards\r\nthe degradation of the National Assembly; and, after December 2, 1851,\r\nwe meet him again as the comfortably stalled and dearly paid\r\nVice-President of the Senate. He had spat into the soup of the\r\nrevolutionists for Bonaparte to eat it.\r\n\r\nOn its part, the Social Democratic party seemed only to look for\r\npretexts in order to make its own victory doubtful, and to dull its\r\nedge. Vidal, one of the newly elected Paris representatives, was\r\nreturned for Strassburg also. He was induced to decline the seat for\r\nParis and accept the one for Strassburg. Thus, instead of giving a\r\ndefinite character to their victory at the hustings, and thereby\r\ncompelling the party of Order forthwith to contest it in parliament;\r\ninstead of thus driving the foe to battle at the season of popular\r\nenthusiasm and of a favorable temper in the Army, the democratic party\r\ntired out Paris with a new campaign during the months of March and\r\nApril; it allowed the excited popular passions to wear themselves out\r\nin this second provisional electoral play it allowed the revolutionary\r\nvigor to satiate itself with constitutional successes, and lose its\r\nbreath in petty intrigues, hollow declamation and sham moves; it gave\r\nthe bourgeoisie time to collect itself and make its preparations\r\nfinally, it allowed the significance of the March elections to find a\r\nsentimentally weakening commentary at the subsequent April election in\r\nthe victory of Eugene Sue. In one word, it turned the 10th of March\r\ninto an April Fool.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary majority perceived the weakness of its adversary. Its\r\nseventeen burgraves—Bonaparte had left to it the direction of and\r\nresponsibility for the attack—, framed a new election law, the moving\r\nof which was entrusted to Mr. Faucher, who had applied for the honor.\r\nOn May 8, he introduced the new law whereby universal suffrage was\r\nabolished; a three years residence in the election district imposed as\r\na condition for voting; and, finally, the proof of this residence made\r\ndependent, for the working-man, upon the testimony of his employer.\r\n\r\nAs revolutionarily as the democrats had agitated and stormed during the\r\nconstitutional struggles, so constitutionally did they, now, when it\r\nwas imperative to attest, arms in hand, the earnestness of their late\r\nelectoral victories, preach order, “majestic calmness,” lawful conduct,\r\ni. e., blind submission to the will of the counter-revolution, which\r\nrevealed itself as law. During the debate, the Mountain put the party\r\nof Order to shame by maintaining the passionless attitude of the\r\nlaw-abiding burger, who upholds the principle of law against\r\nrevolutionary passions; and by twitting the party of Order with the\r\nfearful reproach of proceeding in a revolutionary manner. Even the\r\nnewly elected deputies took pains to prove by their decent and\r\nthoughtful deportment what an act of misjudgment it was to decry them\r\nas anarchists, or explain their election as a victory of the\r\nrevolution. The new election law was passed on May 31. The Mountain\r\ncontented itself with smuggling a protest into the pockets of the\r\nPresident of the Assembly. To the election law followed a new press\r\nlaw, whereby the revolutionary press was completely done away with. It\r\nhad deserved its fate. The “National” and the “Presse,” two bourgeois\r\norgans, remained after this deluge the extreme outposts of the\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, during March and April, the democratic leaders did\r\neverything to involve the people of Paris in a sham battle, and how,\r\nafter May 8, they did everything to keep it away from a real battle. We\r\nmay not here forget that the year 1850 was one of the most brilliant\r\nyears of industrial and commercial prosperity; consequently, that the\r\nParisian proletariat was completely employed. But the election law of\r\nMay 31, 1850 excluded them from all participation in political power;\r\nit cut the field of battle itself from under them; it threw the\r\nworkingmen back into the state of pariahs, which they had occupied\r\nbefore the February revolution. In allowing themselves, in sight of\r\nsuch an occurrence, to be led by the democrats, and in forgetting the\r\nrevolutionary interests of their class through temporary comfort, the\r\nworkingmen abdicated the honor of being a conquering power; they\r\nsubmitted to their fate; they proved that the defeat of June, 1848, had\r\nincapacitated them from resistance for many a year to come finally,\r\nthat the historic process must again, for the time being, proceed over\r\ntheir heads. As to the small traders’ democracy, which, on June 13, had\r\ncried out: “If they but dare to assail universal suffrage . . . then .\r\n. . then we will show who we are!”—they now consoled themselves with\r\nthe thought that the counter-revolutionary blow, which had struck them,\r\nwas no blow at all, and that the law of May 31 was no law. On May 2,\r\n1852, according to them, every Frenchman would appear at the hustings,\r\nin one hand the ballot, in the other the sword. With this prophecy they\r\nset their hearts at ease. Finally, the Army was punished by its\r\nsuperiors for the elections of May and April, 1850, as it was punished\r\nfor the election of May 29, 1849. This time, however, it said to itself\r\ndeterminately: “The revolution shall not cheat us a third time.”\r\n\r\nThe law of May 31, 1850, was the “coup d’etat” of the bourgeoisie. All\r\nits previous conquests over the revolution had only a temporary\r\ncharacter: they became uncertain the moment the National Assembly\r\nstepped off the stage; they depended upon the accident of general\r\nelections, and the history of the elections since 1848 proved\r\nirrefutably that, in the same measure as the actual reign of the\r\nbourgeoisie gathered strength, its moral reign over the masses wore\r\noff. Universal suffrage pronounced itself on May 10 pointedly against\r\nthe reign of the bourgeoisie; the bourgeoisie answered with the\r\nbanishment of universal suffrage. The law of May 31 was, accordingly,\r\none of the necessities of the class struggle. On the other hand, the\r\nconstitution required a minimum of two million votes for the valid\r\nejection of the President of the republic. If none of the Presidential\r\ncandidates polled this minimum, then the National Assembly was to elect\r\nthe President out of the three candidates polling the highest votes. At\r\nthe time that the constitutive body made this law, ten million voters\r\nwere registered on the election rolls. In its opinion, accordingly,\r\none-fifth of the qualified voters sufficed to make a choice for\r\nPresident valid. The law of May 31 struck at least three million voters\r\noff the rolls, reduced the number of qualified voters to seven\r\nmillions, and yet, not withstanding, it kept the lawful minimum at two\r\nmillions for the election of a President. Accordingly, it raised the\r\nlawful minimum from a fifth to almost a third of the qualified voters,\r\ni.e., it did all it could to smuggle the Presidential election out of\r\nthe hands of the people into those of the National Assembly. Thus, by\r\nthe election law of May 31, the party of Order seemed to have doubly\r\nsecured its empire, in that it placed the election of both the National\r\nAssembly and the President of the republic in the keeping of the stable\r\nportion of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strife immediately broke out again between the National Assembly\r\nand Bonaparte, so soon as the revolutionary crisis was weathered, and\r\nuniversal suffrage was abolished.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution had fixed the salary of Bonaparte at 600,000 francs.\r\nBarely half a year after his installation, he succeeded in raising this\r\nsum to its double: Odillon Barrot had wrung from the constitutive\r\nassembly a yearly allowance of 600,000 francs for so-called\r\nrepresentation expenses. After June 13, Bonaparte hinted at similar\r\nsolicitations, to which, however, Barrot then turned a deaf ear. Now,\r\nafter May 31, he forthwith utilized the favorable moment, and caused\r\nhis ministers to move a civil list of three millions in the National\r\nAssembly. A long adventurous, vagabond career had gifted him with the\r\nbest developed antennae for feeling out the weak moments when he could\r\nventure upon squeezing money from his bourgeois. He carried on regular\r\nblackmail. The National Assembly had maimed the sovereignty of the\r\npeople with his aid and his knowledge: he now threatened to denounce\r\nits crime to the tribunal of the people, if it did not pull out its\r\npurse and buy his silence with three millions annually. It had robbed\r\nthree million Frenchmen of the suffrage: for every Frenchman thrown\r\n“out of circulation,” he demanded a franc “in circulation.” He, the\r\nelect of six million, demanded indemnity for the votes he had been\r\nsubsequently cheated of. The Committee of the National Assembly turned\r\nthe importunate fellow away. The Bonapartist press threatened: Could\r\nthe National Assembly break with the President of the republic at a\r\ntime when it had broken definitely and on principle with the mass of\r\nthe nation? It rejected the annual civil list, but granted, for this\r\nonce, an allowance of 2,160,000 francs. Thus it made itself guilty of\r\nthe double weakness of granting the money, and, at the same time,\r\nshowing by its anger that it did so only unwillingly. We shall\r\npresently see to what use Bonaparte put the money. After this\r\naggravating after-play, that followed upon the heels of the abolition\r\nof universal suffrage, and in which Bonaparte exchanged his humble\r\nattitude of the days of the crisis of March and April for one of\r\ndefiant impudence towards the usurping parliament, the National\r\nAssembly adjourned for three months, from August 11, to November 11. It\r\nleft behind in its place a Permanent Committee of 18 members that\r\ncontained no Bonapartist, but did contain a few moderate republicans.\r\nThe Permanent Committee of the year 1849 had numbered only men of order\r\nand Bonapartists. At that time, however, the party of Order declared\r\nitself in permanence against the revolution; now the parliamentary\r\nrepublic declared itself in permanence against the President. After the\r\nlaw of May 31, only this rival still confronted the party of Order.\r\n\r\nWhen the National Assembly reconvened in November, 1850, instead of its\r\nformer petty skirmishes with the President, a great headlong struggle,\r\na struggle for life between the two powers, seemed to have become\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nAs in the year 1849, the party of Order had during this year’s\r\nvacation, dissolved into its two separate factions, each occupied with\r\nits own restoration intrigues, which had received new impetus from the\r\ndeath of Louis Philippe. The Legitimist King, Henry V, had even\r\nappointed a regular Ministry, that resided in Paris, and in which sat\r\nmembers of the Permanent Committee. Hence, Bonaparte was, on his part,\r\njustified in making tours through the French Departments, and—according\r\nto the disposition of the towns that he happened to be gladdening with\r\nhis presence—some times covertly, other times more openly blabbing out\r\nhis own restoration plans, and gaining votes for himself On these\r\nexcursions, which the large official “Moniteur” and the small private\r\n“Moniteurs” of Bonaparte were, of course, bound to celebrate as\r\ntriumphal marches, he was constantly accompanied by affiliated members\r\nof the “Society of December 10” This society dated from the year 1849.\r\nUnder the pretext of founding a benevolent association, the\r\nslum-proletariat of Paris was organized into secret sections, each\r\nsection led by Bonapartist agents, with a Bonapartist General at the\r\nhead of all. Along with ruined roues of questionable means of support\r\nand questionable antecedents, along with the foul and\r\nadventures-seeking dregs of the bourgeoisie, there were vagabonds,\r\ndismissed soldiers, discharged convicts, runaway galley slaves,\r\nsharpers, jugglers, lazzaroni, pickpockets, sleight-of-hand performers,\r\ngamblers, procurers, keepers of disorderly houses, porters, literati,\r\norgan grinders, rag pickers, scissors grinders, tinkers, beggars—in\r\nshort, that whole undefined, dissolute, kicked-about mass that the\r\nFrenchmen style “la Boheme” With this kindred element, Bonaparte formed\r\nthe stock of the “Society of December 10,” a “benevolent association”\r\nin so far as, like Bonaparte himself, all its members felt the need of\r\nbeing benevolent to themselves at the expense of the toiling nation.\r\nThe Bonaparte, who here constitutes himself Chief of the\r\nSlum-Proletariat; who only here finds again in plenteous form the\r\ninterests which he personally pursues; who, in this refuse, offal and\r\nwreck of all classes, recognizes the only class upon which he can\r\ndepend unconditionally;—this is the real Bonaparte, the Bonaparte\r\nwithout qualification. An old and crafty roue, he looks upon the\r\nhistoric life of nations, upon their great and public acts, as comedies\r\nin the ordinary sense, as a carnival, where the great costumes, words\r\nand postures serve only as masks for the pettiest chicaneries. So, on\r\nthe occasion of his expedition against Strassburg when a trained Swiss\r\nvulture impersonated the Napoleonic eagle; so, again, on the occasion\r\nof his raid upon Boulogne, when he struck a few London lackeys into\r\nFrench uniform: they impersonated the army; [#1 Under the reign of\r\nLouis Philippe, Bonaparte made two attempts to restore the throne of\r\nNapoleon: one in October, 1836, in an expedition from Switzerland upon\r\nStrassburg and one in August, 1840, in an expedition from England upon\r\nBoulogne.] and so now, in his “Society of December 10,” he collects\r\n10,000 loafers who are to impersonate the people as Snug the Joiner\r\ndoes the lion. At a period when the bourgeoisie itself is playing the\r\nsheerest comedy, but in the most solemn manner in the world, without\r\ndoing violence to any of the pedantic requirements of French dramatic\r\netiquette, and is itself partly deceived by, partly convinced of, the\r\nsolemnity of its own public acts, the adventurer, who took the comedy\r\nfor simple comedy, was bound to win. Only after he has removed his\r\nsolemn opponent, when he himself takes seriously his own role of\r\nemperor, and, with the Napoleonic mask on, imagines he impersonates the\r\nreal Napoleon, only then does he become the victim of his own peculiar\r\nconception of history—the serious clown, who no longer takes history\r\nfor a comedy, but a comedy for history. What the national work-shops\r\nwere to the socialist workingmen, what the “Gardes mobiles” were to the\r\nbourgeois republicans, that was to Bonaparte the “Society of December\r\n10,”—a force for partisan warfare peculiar to himself. On his journeys,\r\nthe divisions of the Society, packed away on the railroads, improvised\r\nan audience for him, performed public enthusiasm, shouted “vive\r\nl’Empereur,” insulted and clubbed the republicans,—all, of course,\r\nunder the protection of the police. On his return stages to Paris, this\r\nrabble constituted his vanguard, it forestalled or dispersed\r\ncounter-demonstrations. The “Society of December 10” belonged to him,\r\nit was his own handiwork, his own thought. Whatever else he\r\nappropriates, the power of circumstances places in his hands; whatever\r\nelse he does, either circumstances do for him, or he is content to copy\r\nfrom the deeds of others, but he posing before the citizens with the\r\nofficial phrases about “Order,” “Religion,” “Family,” “Property,” and,\r\nbehind him, the secret society of skipjacks and picaroons, the society\r\nof disorder, of prostitution, and of theft,—that is Bonaparte himself\r\nas the original author; and the history of the “Society of December 10”\r\nis his own history. Now, then, it happened that Representatives\r\nbelonging to the party of order occasionally got under the clubs of the\r\nDecembrists. Nay, more. Police Commissioner Yon, who had been assigned\r\nto the National Assembly, and was charged with the guardianship of its\r\nsafety, reported to the Permanent Committee upon the testimony of one\r\nAlais, that a Section of the Decembrists had decided on the murder of\r\nGeneral Changarnier and of Dupin, the President of the National\r\nAssembly, and had already settled upon the men to execute the decree.\r\nOne can imagine the fright of Mr. Dupin. A parliamentary inquest over\r\nthe “Society of December 10,” i. e., the profanation of the Bonapartist\r\nsecret world now seemed inevitable. Just before the reconvening of the\r\nNational Assembly, Bonaparte circumspectly dissolved his Society, of\r\ncourse, on paper only. As late as the end of 1851, Police Prefect\r\nCarlier vainly sought, in an exhaustive memorial, to move him to the\r\nreal dissolution of the Decembrists.\r\n\r\nThe “Society of December 10” was to remain the private army of\r\nBonaparte until he should have succeeded in converting the public Army\r\ninto a “Society of December 10.” Bonaparte made the first attempt in\r\nthis direction shortly after the adjournment of the National Assembly,\r\nand he did so with the money which he had just wrung from it. As a\r\nfatalist, he lives devoted to the conviction that there are certain\r\nHigher Powers, whom man, particularly the soldier, cannot resist. First\r\namong these Powers he numbers cigars and champagne, cold poultry and\r\ngarlic-sausage. Accordingly, in the apartments of the Elysee, he\r\ntreated first the officers and under-officers to cigars and champagne,\r\nto cold poultry and garlic-sausage. On October 3, he repeats this\r\nmanoeuvre with the rank and file of the troops by the review of St.\r\nMaur; and, on October 10, the same manoeuvre again, upon a larger\r\nscale, at the army parade of Satory. The Uncle bore in remembrance the\r\ncampaigns of Alexander in Asia: the Nephew bore in remembrance the\r\ntriumphal marches of Bacchus in the same country. Alexander was,\r\nindeed, a demigod; but Bacchus was a full-fledged god, and the patron\r\ndeity, at that, of the “Society of December 10.”\r\n\r\nAfter the review of October 3, the Permanent Committee summoned the\r\nMinister of War, d’Hautpoul, before it. He promised that such breaches\r\nof discipline should not recur. We have seen how, on October 10th,\r\nBonaparte kept d’Hautpoul’s word. At both reviews Changarnier had\r\ncommanded as Commander-in-chief of the Army of Paris. He, at once\r\nmember of the Permanent Committee, Chief of the National Guard, the\r\n“Savior” of January 29, and June 13, the “Bulwark of Society,”\r\ncandidate of the Party of Order for the office of President, the\r\nsuspected Monk of two monarchies,—he had never acknowledged his\r\nsubordination to the Minister of War, had ever openly scoffed at the\r\nrepublican Constitution, and had pursued Bonaparte with a protection\r\nthat was ambiguously distinguished. Now he became zealous for the\r\ndiscipline in opposition to Bonaparte. While, on October 10, a part of\r\nthe cavalry cried: “Vive Napoleon! Vivent les saucissons;” [#2 Long\r\nlive Napoleon! Long live the sausages!] Changarnier saw to it that at\r\nleast the infantry, which filed by under the command of his friend\r\nNeumeyer, should observe an icy silence. In punishment, the Minister of\r\nWar, at the instigation of Bonaparte, deposed General Neumeyer from his\r\npost in Paris, under the pretext of providing for him as\r\nCommander-in-chief of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Military Divisions.\r\nNeumeyer declined the exchange, and had, in consequence, to give his\r\nresignation. On his part, Changarnier published on November 2, an\r\norder, wherein he forbade the troops to indulge, while under arms, in\r\nany sort of political cries or demonstrations. The papers devoted to\r\nthe Elysee interests attacked Changarnier; the papers of the party of\r\nOrder attacked Bonaparte; the Permanent Committee held frequent secret\r\nsessions, at which it was repeatedly proposed to declare the fatherland\r\nin danger; the Army seemed divided into two hostile camps, with two\r\nhostile staffs; one at the Elysee, where Bonaparte, the other at the\r\nTuileries, where Changarnier resided. All that seemed wanting for the\r\nsignal of battle to sound was the convening of the National Assembly.\r\nThe French public looked upon the friction between Bonaparte and\r\nChangarnier in the light of the English journalist, who characterized\r\nit in these words: “The political servant girls of France are mopping\r\naway the glowing lava of the revolution with old mops, and they scold\r\neach other while doing their work.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bonaparte hastened to depose the Minister of War,\r\nd’Hautpoul; to expedite him heels over head to Algiers; and to appoint\r\nin his place General Schramm as Minister of War. On November 12, he\r\nsent to the National Assembly a message of American excursiveness,\r\noverloaded with details, redolent of order, athirst for conciliation,\r\nresignful to the Constitution, dealing with all and everything, only\r\nnot with the burning questions of the moment. As if in passing he\r\ndropped the words that according to the express provisions of the\r\nConstitution, the President alone disposes over the Army. The message\r\nclosed with the following high-sounding protestations:\r\n\r\n“France demands, above all things, peace . . . Alone bound by an oath,\r\nI shall keep myself within the narrow bounds marked out by it to me . .\r\n. As to me, elected by the people, and owing my power to it alone, I\r\nshall always submit to its lawfully expressed will. Should you at this\r\nsession decide upon the revision of the Constitution, a Constitutional\r\nConvention will regulate the position of the Executive power. If you do\r\nnot, then, the people will, in 1852, solemnly announce its decision.\r\nBut, whatever the solution may be that the future has in store, let us\r\narrive at an understanding to the end that never may passion, surprise\r\nor violence decide over the fate of a great nation. . . . That which,\r\nabove all, bespeaks my attention is, not who will, in 1852, rule over\r\nFrance, but to so devote the time at my disposal that the interval may\r\npass by with-out agitation and disturbance. I have straightforwardly\r\nopened my heart to you, you will answer my frankness with your\r\nconfidence, my good efforts with your co-operation. God will do the\r\nrest.”\r\n\r\nThe honnete, hypocritically temperate, commonplace-virtuous language of\r\nthe bourgeoisie reveals its deep meaning in the mouth of the\r\nself-appointed ruler of the “Society of December 10,” and of the\r\npicnic-hero of St. Maur and Satory.\r\n\r\nThe burgraves of the party of Order did not for a moment deceive\r\nthemselves on the confidence that this unbosoming deserved. They were\r\nlong blase on oaths; they numbered among themselves veterans and\r\nvirtuosi of perjury. The passage about the army did not, however,\r\nescape them. They observed with annoyance that the message, despite its\r\nprolix enumeration of the lately enacted laws, passed, with affected\r\nsilence, over the most important of all, the election law, and,\r\nmoreover, in case no revision of the Constitution was held, left the\r\nchoice of the President, in 1852, with the people. The election law was\r\nthe ball-and-chain to the feet of the party of Order, that hindered\r\nthem from walking, and now assuredly from storming. Furthermore, by the\r\nofficial disbandment of the “Society of December 10,” and the dismissal\r\nof the Minister of War, d’Hautpoul, Bonaparte had, with his own hands,\r\nsacrificed the scapegoats on the altar of the fatherland. He had turned\r\noff the expected collision. Finally, the party of Order itself\r\nanxiously sought to avoid every decisive conflict with the Executive,\r\nto weaken and to blur it over. Fearing to lose its conquests over the\r\nrevolution, it let its rival gather the fruits thereof. “France\r\ndemands, above all things, peace,” with this language had the party of\r\nOrder been apostrophizing the revolution, since February; with this\r\nlanguage did Bonaparte’s message now apostrophize the party of Order:\r\n“France demands, above all things, peace.” Bonaparte committed acts\r\nthat aimed at usurpation, but the party of Order committed a\r\n“disturbance of the peace,” if it raised the hue and cry, and explained\r\nthem hypochrondriacally. The sausages of Satory were mouse-still when\r\nnobody talked about them;—France demands, above all things, “peace.”\r\nAccordingly, Bonaparte demanded that he be let alone; and the\r\nparliamentary party was lamed with a double fear: the fear of\r\nre-conjuring up the revolutionary disturbance of the peace, and the\r\nfear of itself appearing as the disturber of the peace in the eyes of\r\nits own class, of the bourgeosie. Seeing that, above all things, France\r\ndemanded peace, the party of Order did not dare, after Bonaparte had\r\nsaid “peace” in his message, to answer “war.” The public, who had\r\npromised to itself the pleasure of seeing great scenes of scandal at\r\nthe opening of the National Assembly, was cheated out of its\r\nexpectations. The opposition deputies, who demanded the submission of\r\nthe minutes of the Permanent Committee over the October occurrences,\r\nwere outvoted. All debate that might excite was fled from on principle.\r\nThe labors of the National Assembly during November and December, 1850,\r\nwere without interest.\r\n\r\nFinally, toward the end of December, began a guerilla warfare about\r\ncertain prerogatives of the parliament. The movement sank into the mire\r\nof petty chicaneries on the prerogative of the two powers, since, with\r\nthe abolition of universal suffrage, the bourgeoisie had done away with\r\nthe class struggle.\r\n\r\nA judgment for debt had been secured against Mauguin, one of the\r\nRepresentatives. Upon inquiry by the President of the Court, the\r\nMinister of Justice, Rouher, declared that an order of arrest should be\r\nmade out without delay. Manguin was, accordingly, cast into the\r\ndebtors’ prison. The National Assembly bristled up when it heard of the\r\n“attentat.” It not only ordered his immediate release, but had him\r\nforcibly taken out of Clichy the same evening by its own greffier. In\r\norder, nevertheless, to shield its belief in the “sacredness of private\r\nproperty,” and also with the ulterior thought of opening, in case of\r\nneed, an asylum for troublesome Mountainers, it declared the\r\nimprisonment of a Representative for debt to be permissible upon its\r\nprevious consent. It forgot to decree that the President also could be\r\nlocked up for debt. By its act, it wiped out the last semblance of\r\ninviolability that surrounded the members of its own body.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, upon the testimony of one Allais, Police\r\nCommissioner Yon had charged a Section of Decembrists with a plan to\r\nmurder Dupin and Changarnier. With an eye upon that, the questors\r\nproposed at the very first session, that the parliament organize a\r\npolice force of its own, paid for out of the private budget of the\r\nNational Assembly itself, and wholly independent of the Police\r\nPrefects. The Minister of the Interior, Baroche, protested against this\r\ntrespass on his preserves. A miserable compromise followed, according\r\nto which the Police Commissioner of the Assembly was to be paid out of\r\nits own private budget and was to be subject to the appointment and\r\ndismissal of its own questors, but only upon previous agreement with\r\nthe Minister of the Interior. In the meantime Allais had been\r\nprosecuted by the Government. It was an easy thing in Court, to present\r\nhis testimony in the light of a mystification, and, through the mouth\r\nof the Public Prosecutor, to throw Dupin, Changarnier, Yon, together\r\nwith the whole National Assembly, into a ridiculous light. Thereupon,\r\non December 29, Minister Baroche writes a letter to Dupin, in which he\r\ndemands the dismissal of Yon. The Committee of the National Assembly\r\ndecides to keep Yon in office; nevertheless, the National Assembly,\r\nfrightened by its own violence in the affair of Mauguin, and\r\naccustomed, every time it has shied a blow at the Executive, to receive\r\nback from it two in exchange, does not sanction this decision. It\r\ndismisses Yon in reward for his zeal in office, and robs itself of a\r\nparliamentary prerogative, indispensable against a person who does not\r\ndecide by night to execute by day, but decides by day and executes by\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how, during the months of November and December, under\r\ngreat and severe provocations, the National Assembly evaded and refused\r\nthe combat with the Executive power. Now we see it compelled to accept\r\nit on the smallest occasions. In the affair of Mauguin, it confirms in\r\nprinciple the liability of a Representative to imprisonment for debt,\r\nbut to itself reserves the power of allowing the principle to be\r\napplied only to the Representatives whom it dislikes,-and for this\r\ninfamous privilege we see it wrangling with the Minister of Justice.\r\nInstead of utilizing the alleged murder plan to the end of fastening an\r\ninquest upon the “Society of December 10,” and of exposing Bonaparte\r\nbeyond redemption before France and his true figure, as the head of the\r\nslum-proletariat of Paris, it allows the collision to sink to a point\r\nwhere the only issue between itself and the Minister of the Interior\r\nis. Who has jurisdiction over the appointment and dismissal of a Police\r\nCommissioner? Thus we see the party of Order, during this whole period,\r\ncompelled by its ambiguous position to wear out and fritter away its\r\nconflict with the Executive power in small quarrels about jurisdiction,\r\nin chicaneries, in pettifogging, in boundary disputes, and to turn the\r\nstalest questions of form into the very substance of its activity. It\r\ndares not accept the collision at the moment when it involves a\r\nprinciple, when the Executive power has really given itself a blank,\r\nand when the cause of the National Assembly would be the cause of the\r\nnation. It would thereby have issued to the nation an order of march;\r\nand it feared nothing so much as that the nation should move. Hence, on\r\nthese occasions, it rejects the motions of the Mountain, and proceeds\r\nto the order of the day. After the issue has in this way lost all\r\nmagnitude, the Executive power quietly awaits the moment when it can\r\ntake it up again upon small and insignificant occasions; when, so to\r\nsay, the issue offers only a parliamentary local interest. Then does\r\nthe repressed valor of the party of Order break forth, then it tears\r\naway the curtain from the scene, then it denounces the President, then\r\nit declares the republic to be in danger,—but then all its pathos\r\nappears stale, and the occasion for the quarrel a hypocritical pretext,\r\nor not at all worth the effort. The parliamentary tempest becomes a\r\ntempest in a tea-pot, the struggle an intrigue, the collision a\r\nscandal. While the revolutionary classes gloat with sardonic laughter\r\nover the humiliation of the National Assembly—they, of course, being as\r\nenthusiastic for the prerogatives of the parliament as that body is for\r\npublic freedom—the bourgeoisie, outside of the parliament, does not\r\nunderstand how the bourgeoisie, inside of the parliament, can squander\r\nits time with such petty bickerings, and can endanger peace by such\r\nwretched rivalries with the President. It is puzzled at a strategy that\r\nmakes peace the very moment when everybody expects battles, and that\r\nattacks the very moment everybody believes peace has been concluded.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, Pascal Duprat interpellated the Minister of the\r\nInterior on the “Goldbar Lottery.” This lottery was a “Daughter from\r\nElysium”; Bonaparte, together with his faithful, had given her birth;\r\nand Police Prefect Carlier had placed her under his official\r\nprotection, although the French law forbade all lotteries, with the\r\nexception of games for benevolent purposes. Seven million tickets, a\r\nfranc a piece, and the profit ostensibly destined to the shipping of\r\nParisian vagabonds to California. Golden dreams were to displace the\r\nSocialist dreams of the Parisian proletariat; the tempting prospect of\r\na prize was to displace the doctrinal right to labor. Of course, the\r\nworkingmen of Paris did not recognize in the lustre of the California\r\ngold bars the lack-lustre francs that had been wheedled out of their\r\npockets. In the main, however, the scheme was an unmitigated swindle.\r\nThe vagabonds, who meant to open California gold mines without taking\r\nthe pains to leave Paris, were Bonaparte himself and his Round Table of\r\ndesperate insolvents. The three millions granted by the National\r\nAssembly were rioted away; the Treasury had to be refilled somehow or\r\nanother. In vain did Bonaparte open a national subscription, at the\r\nhead of which he himself figured with a large sum, for the\r\nestablishment of so-called “cites ouvrieres.” [#3 Work cities.] The\r\nhard-hearted bourgeois waited, distrustful, for the payment of his own\r\nshares; and, as this, of course, never took place, the speculation in\r\nSocialist castles in the air fell flat. The gold bars drew better.\r\nBonaparte and his associates did not content themselves with putting\r\ninto their own pockets part of the surplus of the seven millions over\r\nand above the bars that were to be drawn; they manufactured false\r\ntickets; they sold, of Number 10 alone, fifteen to twenty lots—a\r\nfinancial operation fully in the spirit of the “Society of December\r\n10”! The National Assembly did not here have before it the fictitious\r\nPresident of the Republic, but Bonaparte himself in flesh and blood.\r\nHere it could catch him in the act, not in conflict with the\r\nConstitution, but with the penal code. When, upon Duprat’s\r\ninterpellation, the National Assembly went over to the order of the\r\nday, this did not happen simply because Girardin’s motion to declare\r\nitself “satisfied” reminded the party of Order of its own systematic\r\ncorruption: the bourgeois, above all the bourgeois who has been\r\ninflated into a statesman, supplements his practical meanness with\r\ntheoretical pompousness. As statesman, he becomes, like the Government\r\nfacing him, a superior being, who can be fought only in a higher, more\r\nexalted manner.\r\n\r\nBonaparte-who, for the very reason of his being a “bohemian,” a\r\nprincely slum-proletarian, had over the scampish bourgeois the\r\nadvantage that he could carry on the fight after the Assembly itself\r\nhad carried him with its own hands over the slippery ground of the\r\nmilitary banquets, of the reviews, of the “Society of December 10,”\r\nand, finally, of the penal code-now saw that the moment had arrived\r\nwhen he could move from the seemingly defensive to the offensive. He\r\nwas but little troubled by the intermediate and trifling defeats of the\r\nMinister of Justice, of the Minister of War, of the Minister of the\r\nNavy, of the Minister of Finance, whereby the National Assembly\r\nindicated its growling displeasure. Not only did he prevent the\r\nMinisters from resigning, and thus recognizing the subordination of the\r\nexecutive power to the Parliament; he could now accomplish what during\r\nthe vacation of the National Assembly he had commenced, the separation\r\nof the military power from the Assembly—the deposition of Changarnier.\r\n\r\nAn Elysee paper published an order, issued during the month of May,\r\nostensibly to the First Military Division, and, hence, proceeding from\r\nChangarnier, wherein the officers were recommended, in case of an\r\nuprising, to give no quarter to the traitors in their own ranks, to\r\nshoot them down on the spot, and to refuse troops to the National\r\nAssembly, should it make a requisition for such. On January 3, 1851,\r\nthe Cabinet was interpellated on this order. The Cabinet demands for\r\nthe examination of the affair at first three months, then one week,\r\nfinally only twenty-four hours’ time. The Assembly orders an immediate\r\nexplanation Changarnier rises and declares that this order never\r\nexisted; he adds that he would ever hasten to respond to the calls of\r\nthe National Assembly, and that, in case of a collision, they could\r\ncount upon him. The Assembly receives his utterances with inexpressible\r\napplause, and decrees a vote of confidence to him. It thereby resign\r\nits own powers; it decrees its own impotence and the omnipotence of the\r\nArmy by committing itself to the private protection of a general. But\r\nthe general, in turn, deceives himself when he places at the Assembly’s\r\ndisposal and against Bonaparte a power that he holds only as a fief\r\nfrom that same Bonaparte, and when, on his part, he expects protection\r\nfrom this Parliament, from his protege’, itself needful of protection.\r\nBut Changarnier has faith in the mysterious power with which since\r\nJanuary, 1849, he had been clad by the bourgeoisie. He takes himself\r\nfor the Third Power, standing beside the other Powers of Government. He\r\nshares the faith of all the other heroes, or rather saints, of this\r\nepoch, whose greatness consists but in the interested good opinion that\r\ntheir own party holds of them, and who shrink into every-day figures so\r\nsoon as circumstances invite them to perform miracles. Infidelity is,\r\nindeed, the deadly enemy of these supposed heroes and real saints.\r\nHence their virtuously proud indignation at the unenthusiastic wits and\r\nscoffers.\r\n\r\nThat same evening the Ministers were summoned to the Elysee; Bonaparte\r\npresses the removal of Changarnier; five Ministers refuse to sign the\r\norder; the “Moniteur” announces a Ministerial crisis; and the party of\r\nOrder threatens the formation of a Parliamentary army under the command\r\nof Changarnier. The party of Order had the constitutional power hereto.\r\nIt needed only to elect Changarnier President of the National Assembly\r\nin order to make a requisition for whatever military forces it needed\r\nfor its own safety. It could do this all the more safely, seeing that\r\nChangarnier still stood at the head of the Army and of the Parisian\r\nNational Guard, and only lay in wait to be summoned, together with the\r\nArmy. The Bonapartist press did not even dare to question the right of\r\nthe National Assembly to issue a direct requisition for troops;—a legal\r\nscruple, that, under the given circumstances, did not promise success.\r\nThat the Army would have obeyed the orders of the National Assembly is\r\nprobable, when it is considered that Bonaparte had to look eight days\r\nall over Paris to find two generals—Baraguay d’Hilliers and St. Jean\r\nd’Angley—who declared themselves ready to countersign the order\r\ncashiering Changamier. That, however, the party of Order would have\r\nfound in its own ranks and in the parliament the requisite vote for\r\nsuch a decision is more than doubtful, when it is considered that,\r\neight days later, 286 votes pulled away from it, and that, as late as\r\nDecember, 1851, at the last decisive hour, the Mountain rejected a\r\nsimilar proposition. Nevertheless, the burgraves might still have\r\nsucceeded in driving the mass of their party to an act of heroism,\r\nconsisting in feeling safe behind a forest of bayonets, and in\r\naccepting the services of the Army, which found itself deserted in its\r\ncamp. Instead of this, the Messieurs Burgraves betook themselves to the\r\nElysee on the evening of January 6, with the view of inducing\r\nBonaparte, by means of politic words and considerations, to drop the\r\nremoval of Changarnier. Him whom we must convince we recognize as the\r\nmaster of the situation. Bonaparte, made to feel secure by this step,\r\nappoints on January 12 a new Ministry, in which the leaders of the old,\r\nFould and Baroche, are retained. St Jean d’Angley becomes Minister of\r\nWar; the “Moniteur” announces the decree cashiering Changarnier; his\r\ncommand is divided up between Baraguay d’Hilliers, who receives the\r\nFirst Division, and Perrot, who is placed over the National Guard. The\r\n“Bulwark of Society” is turned down; and, although no dog barks over\r\nthe event, in the Bourses the stock quotations rise.\r\n\r\nBy repelling the Army, that, in Changarnier’s person, put itself at its\r\ndisposal, and thus irrevocably stood up against the President, the\r\nparty of Order declares that the bourgeoisie has lost its vocation to\r\nreign. Already there was no parliamentary Ministry. By losing,\r\nfurthermore, the handle to the Army and to the National Guard, what\r\ninstrument of force was there left to the National Assembly in order to\r\nmaintain both the usurped power of the parliament over the people, and\r\nits constitutional power over the President? None. All that was left to\r\nit was the appeal to peaceful principles, that itself had always\r\nexplained as “general rules” merely, to be prescribed to third parties,\r\nand only in order to enable itself to move all the more freely. With\r\nthe removal of Changarnier, with the transfer of the military power to\r\nBonaparte, closes the first part of the period that we are considering,\r\nthe period of the struggle between the party of Order and the Executive\r\npower. The war between the two powers is now openly declared; it is\r\nconducted openly; but only after the party of Order has lost both arms\r\nand soldier. With-out a Ministry, without any army, without a people,\r\nwithout the support of public opinion; since its election law of May\r\n31, no longer the representative of the sovereign nation sans eyes,\r\nsans ears, sans teeth, sans everything, the National Assembly had\r\ngradually converted itself into a French Parliament of olden days, that\r\nmust leave all action to the Government, and content itself with\r\ngrowling remonstrances “post festum.” [#4 After the act is done; after\r\nthe fact.]\r\n\r\nThe party of Order receives the new Ministry with a storm of\r\nindignation. General Bedeau calls to mind the mildness of the Permanent\r\nCommittee during the vacation, and the excessive prudence with which it\r\nhad renounced the privilege of disclosing its minutes. Now, the\r\nMinister of the Interior himself insists upon the disclosure of these\r\nminutes, that have now, of course, become dull as stagnant waters,\r\nreveal no new facts, and fall without making the slightest effect upon\r\nthe blase public. Upon Remusat’s proposition, the National Assembly\r\nretreats into its Committees, and appoints a “Committee on\r\nExtraordinary Measures.” Paris steps all the less out of the ruts of\r\nits daily routine, seeing that business is prosperous at the time, the\r\nmanufactories busy, the prices of cereals low, provisions abundant, the\r\nsavings banks receiving daily new deposits. The “extraordinary\r\nmeasures,” that the parliament so noisily announced fizzle out on\r\nJanuary 18 in a vote of lack of confidence against the Ministry,\r\nwithout General Changarnier’s name being even mentioned. The party of\r\nOrder was forced to frame its motion in that way so as to secure the\r\nvotes of the republicans, because, of all the acts of the Ministry,\r\nChangarnier’s dismissal only was the very one they approved, while the\r\nparty of Order cannot in fact, condemn the other Ministerial acts which\r\nit had itself dictated. The January 18 vote of lack of confidence was\r\ndecided by 415 ayes against 286 nays. It was, accordingly put through\r\nby a coalition of the uncompromising Legitimists and Orleanists with\r\nthe pure republicans and the Mountain. Thus it revealed the fact that,\r\nin its conflicts with Bonaparte, not only the Ministry, not only the\r\nArmy, but also its independent parliamentary majority; that a troop of\r\nRepresentatives had deserted its camp out of a fanatic zeal for\r\nharmony, out of fear of fight, out of lassitude, out of family\r\nconsiderations for the salaries of relatives in office, out of\r\nspeculations on vacancies in the Ministry (Odillon Barrot), or out of\r\nthat unmitigated selfishness that causes the average bourgeois to be\r\never inclined to sacrifice the interests of his class to this or that\r\nprivate motive. The Bonapartist Representatives belonged from the start\r\nto the party of Order only in the struggle against the revolution. The\r\nleader of the Catholic party, Montalembert, already then threw his\r\ninfluence in the scale of Bonaparte, since he despaired of the vitality\r\nof the parliamentary party. Finally, the leaders of this party itself,\r\nThiers and Berryer—the Orleanist and the Legitimist—were compelled to\r\nproclaim themselves openly as republicans; to admit that their heart\r\nfavored royalty, but their head the republic; that their parliamentary\r\nrepublic was the only possible form for the rule of the bourgeoisie\r\nThus were they compelled to brand, before the eyes of the bourgeois\r\nclass itself, as an intrigue—as dangerous as it was senseless—the\r\nrestoration plans, which they continued to pursue indefatigably behind\r\nthe back of the parliament.\r\n\r\nThe January 18 vote of lack of confidence struck the Ministers, not the\r\nPresident. But it was not the Ministry, it was the President who had\r\ndeposed Changarnier. Should the party of Order place Bonaparte himself\r\nunder charges? On account of his restoration hankerings? These only\r\nsupplemented their own. On account of his conspiracy at the military\r\nreviews and of the “Society of December 10”? They had long since buried\r\nthese subjects under simple orders of business. On account of the\r\ndischarge of the hero of January 29 and June 13, of the man who, in\r\nMay, 1850, threatened, in case of riot, to set Paris on fire at all its\r\nfour corners? Their allies of the Mountain and Cavaignac did not even\r\nallow them to console the fallen “Bulwark of Society” with an official\r\ntestimony of their sympathy. They themselves could not deny the\r\nconstitutional right of the President to remove a General. They stormed\r\nonly because he made an unparliamentary use of his constitutional\r\nright. Had they not themselves constantly made an unconstitutional use\r\nof their parliamentary prerogative, notably by the abolition of\r\nuniversal suffrage? Consequently they were reminded to move exclusively\r\nwithin parliamentary bounds. Indeed, it required that peculiar disease,\r\na disease that, since 1848, has raged over the whole continent,\r\n“Parliamentary Idiocy,”—that fetters those whom it infects to an\r\nimaginary world, and robs them of all sense, all remembrance, all\r\nunderstanding of the rude outside world;—it required this\r\n“Parliamentary Idiocy” in order that the party of Order, which had,\r\nwith its own hands, destroyed all the conditions for parliamentary\r\npower, and, in its struggle with the other classes, was obliged to\r\ndestroy them, still should consider its parliamentary victories as\r\nvictories, and imagine it hit the President by striking his Ministers.\r\nThey only afforded him an opportunity to humble the National Assembly\r\nanew in the eyes of the nation. On January 20, the “Moniteur” announced\r\nthat the whole the dismissal of the whole Ministry was accepted. Under\r\nthe pretext that none of the parliamentary parties had any longer the\r\nmajority—as proved by the January 18 vote, that fruit of the coalition\r\nbetween mountain and royalists—, and, in order to await the\r\nre-formation of a majority, Bonaparte appointed a so-called transition\r\nMinistry, of whom no member belonged to the parliament-altogether\r\nwholly unknown and insignificant individuals; a Ministry of mere clerks\r\nand secretaries. The party of Order could now wear itself out in the\r\ngame with these puppets; the Executive power no longer considered it\r\nworth the while to be seriously represented in the National Assembly.\r\nBy this act Bonaparte concentrated the whole executive power all the\r\nmore securely in his own person; he had all the freer elbow-room to\r\nexploit the same to his own ends, the more his Ministers became mere\r\nsupernumeraries.\r\n\r\nThe party of Order, now allied with the Mountain, revenged itself by\r\nrejecting the Presidential endowment project of 1,800.000 francs, which\r\nthe chief of the “Society of December 10” had compelled his Ministerial\r\nclerks to present to the Assembly. This time a majority of only 102\r\nvotes carried the day accordingly since January 18, 27 more votes had\r\nfallen off: the dissolution of the party of Order was making progress.\r\nLest any one might for a moment be deceived touching the meaning of its\r\ncoalition with the Mountain, the party of Order simultaneously scorned\r\neven to consider a motion, signed by 189 members of the Mountain, for a\r\ngeneral amnesty to political criminals. It was enough that the Minister\r\nof the Interior, one Baisse, declared that the national tranquility was\r\nonly in appearance, in secret there reigned deep agitation, in secret,\r\nubiquitous societies were organized, the democratic papers were\r\npreparing to reappear, the reports from the Departments were\r\nunfavorable, the fugitives of Geneva conducted a conspiracy via Lyons\r\nthrough the whole of southern France, France stood on the verge of an\r\nindustrial and commercial crisis, the manufacturers of Roubaix were\r\nworking shorter hours, the prisoners of Belle Isle had mutinied;—it was\r\nenough that even a mere Baisse should conjure up the “Red Spectre” for\r\nthe party of Order to reject without discussion a motion that would\r\nhave gained for the National Assembly a tremendous popularity, and\r\nthrown Bonaparte back into its arms. Instead of allowing itself to be\r\nintimidated by the Executive power with the perspective of fresh\r\ndisturbances, the party of Order should rather have allowed a little\r\nelbow-room to the class struggle, in order to secure the dependence of\r\nthe Executive upon itself. But it did not feel itself equal to the task\r\nof playing with fire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the so-called transition Ministry vegetated along until the\r\nmiddle of April. Bonaparte tired out and fooled the National Assembly\r\nwith constantly new Ministerial combinations. Now he seemed to intend\r\nconstructing a republican Ministry with Lamartine and Billault; then, a\r\nparliamentary one with the inevitable Odillon Barrot, whose name must\r\nnever be absent when a dupe is needed; then again, a Legitimist, with\r\nBatismenil and Lenoist d’Azy; and yet again, an Orleansist, with\r\nMalleville. While thus throwing the several factions of the party of\r\nOrder into strained relations with one another, and alarming them all\r\nwith the prospect of a republican Ministry, together with the\r\nthere-upon inevitable restoration of universal suffrage, Bonaparte\r\nsimultaneously raises in the bourgeoisie the conviction that his\r\nsincere efforts for a parliamentary Ministry are wrecked upon the\r\nirreconcilable antagonism of the royalist factions. All the while the\r\nbourgeoisie was clamoring louder and louder for a “strong Government,”\r\nand was finding it less and less pardonable to leave France “without an\r\nadministration,” in proportion as a general commercial crisis seemed to\r\nbe under way and making recruits for Socialism in the cities, as did\r\nthe ruinously low price of grain in the rural districts. Trade became\r\ndaily duller; the unemployed hands increased perceptibly; in Paris, at\r\nleast 10,000 workingmen were without bread; in Rouen, Muehlhausen,\r\nLyons, Roubaix, Tourcoign, St. Etienue, Elbeuf, etc., numerous\r\nfactories stood idle. Under these circumstances Bonaparte could venture\r\nto restore, on April 11, the Ministry of January 18; Messieurs Rouher,\r\nFould, Baroche, etc., reinforced by Mr. Leon Faucher, whom the\r\nconstitutive assembly had, during its last days, unanimously, with the\r\nexception of five Ministerial votes, branded with a vote of censure for\r\ncirculating false telegraphic dispatches. Accordingly, the National\r\nAssembly had won a victory on January 18 over the Ministry, it had, for\r\nthe period of three months, been battling with Bonaparte, and all this\r\nmerely to the end that, on April 11, Fould and Baroche should be able\r\nto take up the Puritan Faucher as third in their ministerial league.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1849, Bonaparte had satisfied himself with an\r\nUnparliamentary, in January, 1851, with an Extra-Parliamentary, on\r\nApril 11, he felt strong enough to form an Anti-Parliamentary Ministry,\r\nthat harmoniously combined within itself the votes of lack of\r\nconfidence of both assemblies-the constitutive and the legislative, the\r\nrepublican and the royalist. This ministerial progression was a\r\nthermometer by which the parliament could measure the ebbing\r\ntemperature of its own life. This had sunk so low by the end of April\r\nthat, at a personal interview, Persigny could invite Changarnier to go\r\nover to the camp of the President. Bonaparte, he assured Changarnier,\r\nconsidered the influence of the National Assembly to be wholly\r\nannihilated, and already the proclamation was ready, that was to be\r\npublished after the steadily contemplated, but again accidentally\r\npostponed “coup d’etat.” Changarnier communicated this announcement of\r\nits death to the leaders of the party of Order; but who was there to\r\nbelieve a bed-bug bite could kill? The parliament, however beaten,\r\nhowever dissolved, however death-tainted it was, could not persuade\r\nitself to see, in the duel with the grotesque chief of the “Society of\r\nDecember 10,” anything but a duel with a bed-bug. But Bonaparte\r\nanswered the party of Order as Agesilaus did King Agis: “I seem to you\r\nan ant; but shall one day be a lion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coalition with the Mountain and the pure republicans, to which the\r\nparty of Order found itself condemned in its fruitless efforts to keep\r\npossession of the military and to reconquer supreme control over the\r\nExecutive power, proved conclusively that it had forfeited its\r\nindependent parliamentary majority. The calendar and clock merely gave,\r\non May 29, the signal for its complete dissolution. With May 29\r\ncommenced the last year of the life of the National Assembly. It now\r\nhad to decide for the unchanged continuance or the revision of the\r\nConstitution. But a revision of the Constitution meant not only the\r\ndefinitive supremacy of either the bourgeoisie of the small traders’\r\ndemocracy, of either democracy or proletarian anarchy, of either a\r\nparliamentary republic or Bonaparte, it meant also either Orleans or\r\nBourbon! Thus fell into the very midst of the parliament the apple of\r\ndiscord, around which the conflict of interests, that cut up the party\r\nof Order into hostile factions, was to kindle into an open\r\nconflagration. The party of Order was a combination of heterogeneous\r\nsocial substances. The question of revision raised a political\r\ntemperature, in which the product was reduced to its original\r\ncomponents.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the Bonapartists in the revision was simple: they were\r\nabove all concerned in the abolition of Article 45, which forbade\r\nBonaparte’s reelection and the prolongation of his term. Not less\r\nsimple seemed to be the position of the republicans; they rejected all\r\nrevision, seeing in that only a general conspiracy against the\r\nrepublic; as they disposed over more than one-fourth of the votes in\r\nthe National Assembly, and, according to the Constitution, a\r\nthree-fourths majority was requisite to revise and to call a revisory\r\nconvention, they needed only to count their own votes to be certain of\r\nvictory. Indeed, they were certain of it.\r\n\r\nOver and against these clear-cut positions, the party of Order found\r\nitself tangled in inextricable contradictions. If it voted against the\r\nrevision, it endangered the “status quo,” by leaving to Bonaparte only\r\none expedient—that of violence and handing France over, on May 2, 1852,\r\nat the very time of election, a prey to revolutionary anarchy, with a\r\nPresident whose authority was at an end; with a parliament that the\r\nparty had long ceased to own, and with a people that it meant to\r\nre-conquer. If it voted constitutionally for a revision, it knew that\r\nit voted in vain and would constitutionally have to go under before the\r\nveto of the republicans. If, unconstitutionally, it pronounced a simple\r\nmajority binding, it could hope to control the revolution only in case\r\nit surrendered unconditionally to the domination of the Executive\r\npower: it then made Bonaparte master of the Constitution, of the\r\nrevision and of itself. A merely partial revision, prolonging the term\r\nof the President, opened the way to imperial usurpation; a general\r\nrevision, shortening the existence of the republic, threw the dynastic\r\nclaims into an inevitable conflict: the conditions for a Bourbon and\r\nthose for an Orleanist restoration were not only different, they\r\nmutually excluded each other.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary republic was more than a neutral ground on which the\r\ntwo factions of the French bourgeoisie—Legitimists and Orleanists,\r\nlarge landed property and manufacture—could lodge together with equal\r\nrights. It was the indispensable condition for their common reign, the\r\nonly form of government in which their common class interest could\r\ndominate both the claims of their separate factions and all the other\r\nclasses of society. As royalists, they relapsed into their old\r\nantagonism into the struggle for the overlordship of either landed\r\nproperty or of money; and the highest expression of this antagonism,\r\nits personification, were the two kings themselves, their dynasties.\r\nHence the resistance of the party of Order to the recall of the\r\nBourbons.\r\n\r\nThe Orleanist Representative Creton moved periodically in 1849, 1850\r\nand 1851 the repeal of the decree of banishment against the royal\r\nfamilies; as periodically did the parliament present the spectacle of\r\nan Assembly of royalists who stubbornly shut to their banished kings\r\nthe door through which they could return home. Richard III murdered\r\nHenry VI, with the remark that he was too good for this world, and\r\nbelonged in heaven. They declared France too bad to have her kings back\r\nagain. Forced by the power of circumstances, they had become\r\nrepublicans, and repeatedly sanctioned the popular mandate that exiled\r\ntheir kings from France.\r\n\r\nThe revision of the Constitution, and circumstances compelled its\r\nconsideration, at once made uncertain not only the republic itself, but\r\nalso the joint reign of the two bourgeois factions; and it revived,\r\nwith the possibility of the monarchy, both the rivalry of interests\r\nwhich these two factions had alternately allowed to preponderate, and\r\nthe struggle for the supremacy of the one over the other. The diplomats\r\nof the party of Order believed they could allay the struggle by a\r\ncombination of the two dynasties through a so-called fusion of the\r\nroyalist parties and their respective royal houses. The true fusion of\r\nthe restoration and the July monarchy was, however, the parliamentary\r\nrepublic, in which the Orleanist and Legitimist colors were dissolved,\r\nand the bourgeois species vanished in the plain bourgeois, in the\r\nbourgeois genus. Now however, the plan was to turn the Orleanist\r\nLegitimist and the Legitimist Orleanist. The kingship, in which their\r\nantagonism was personified, was to incarnate their unity, the\r\nexpression of their exclusive faction interests was to become the\r\nexpression of their common class interest; the monarchy was to\r\naccomplish what only the abolition of two monarchies—the republic could\r\nand did accomplish. This was the philosopher’s stone, for the finding\r\nof which the doctors of the party of Order were breaking their heads.\r\nAs though the Legitimate monarchy ever could be the monarchy of the\r\nindustrial bourgeoisie, or the bourgeois monarchy the monarchy of the\r\nhereditary landed aristocracy! As though landed property and industry\r\ncould fraternize under one crown, where the crown could fall only upon\r\none head, the head of the older or the younger brother! As though\r\nindustry could at all deal upon a footing of equality with landed\r\nproperty, so long as landed property did not decide itself to become\r\nindustrial. If Henry V were to die tomorrow, the Count of Paris would\r\nnot, therefore, become the king of the Legitimists, unless he ceased to\r\nbe the King of the Orleanists. Nevertheless, the fusion philosophers,\r\nwho became louder in the measure that the question of revision stepped\r\nto the fore, who had provided themselves with a daily organ in the\r\n“Assemblee Nationale,” who, even at this very moment (February, 1852)\r\nare again at work, explained the whole difficulty by the opposition and\r\nrivalries of the two dynasties. The attempts to reconcile the family of\r\nOrleans with Henry V., begun since the death of Louis Philippe, but, as\r\nall these dynastic intrigues carried on only during the vacation of the\r\nNational Assembly, between acts, behind the scenes, more as a\r\nsentimental coquetry with the old superstition than as a serious\r\naffair, were now raised by the party of Order to the dignity of a great\r\nState question, and were conducted upon the public stage, instead of,\r\nas heretofore in the amateurs’ theater. Couriers flew from Paris to\r\nVenice, from Venice to Claremont, from Claremont to Paris. The Duke of\r\nChambord issues a manifesto in which he announces not his own, but the\r\n“national” restoration, “with the aid of all the members of his\r\nfamily.” The Oleanist Salvandy throws himself at the feet of Henry V.\r\nThe Legitimist leaders Berryer, Benoit d’Azy, St. Priest travel to\r\nClaremont, to persuade the Orleans; but in vain. The fusionists learn\r\ntoo late that the interests of the two bourgeois factions neither lose\r\nin exclusiveness nor gain in pliancy where they sharpen to a point in\r\nthe form of family interests, of the interests of the two royal houses.\r\nWhen Henry V. recognized the Count of Paris as his successor—the only\r\nsuccess that the fusion could at best score—the house of Orleans\r\nacquired no claim that the childlessness of Henry V. had not already\r\nsecured to it; but, on the other hand, it lost all the claims that it\r\nhad conquered by the July revolution. It renounced its original claims,\r\nall the title, that, during a struggle nearly one hundred years long,\r\nit had wrested from the older branch of the Bourbons; it bartered away\r\nits historic prerogative, the prerogative of its family-tree. Fusion,\r\naccordingly, amounted to nothing else than the resignation of the house\r\nof Orleans, its Legitimist resignation, a repentful return from the\r\nProtestant State Church into the Catholic;—a return, at that, that did\r\nnot even place it on the throne that it had lost, but on the steps of\r\nthe throne on which it was born. The old Orleanist Ministers Guizot,\r\nDuchatel, etc., who likewise hastened to Claremont, to advocate the\r\nfusion, represented in fact only the nervous reaction of the July\r\nmonarchy; despair, both in the citizen kingdom and the kingdom of\r\ncitizens; the superstitious belief in legitimacy as the last amulet\r\nagainst anarchy. Mediators, in their imagination, between Orleans and\r\nBourbon, they were in reality but apostate Orleanists, and as such were\r\nthey received by the Prince of Joinville. The virile, bellicose part of\r\nthe Orleanists, on the contrary—Thiers, Baze, etc.—, persuaded the\r\nfamily of Louis Philippe all the easier that, seeing every plan for the\r\nimmediate restoration of the monarchy presupposed the fusion of the two\r\ndynasties, and every plan for fusion the resignation of the house of\r\nOrleans, it corresponded, on the contrary, wholly with the tradition of\r\nits ancestors to recognize the republic for the time being, and to wait\r\nuntil circumstances permitted I the conversion of the Presidential\r\nchair into a throne. Joinville’s candidacy was set afloat as a rumor,\r\npublic curiosity was held in suspense, and a few months later, after\r\nthe revision was rejected, openly proclaimed in September.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the essay of a royalist fusion between Orleanists and\r\nLegitimists did not miscarry only, it broke up their parliamentary\r\nfusion, the republican form that they had adopted in common, and it\r\ndecomposed the party of Order into its original components. But the\r\nwider the breach became between Venice and Claremont, the further they\r\ndrifted away from each I other, and the greater the progress made by\r\nthe Joinville agitation, all the more active and earnest became the\r\nnegotiations between Faucher, the Minister of Bonaparte, and the\r\nLegitimists.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the party of Order went beyond its original\r\nelements. Each of the two large factions fell in turn into new\r\nfragments. It was as if all the old political shades, that formerly\r\nfought and crowded one another within each of the two circles—be it\r\nthat of the Legitimists or that of the Orleanists—, had been thawed out\r\nlike dried infusoria by contact with water; as if they had recovered\r\nenough vitality to build their own groups and assert their own\r\nantagonisms. The Legitimists dreamed they were back amidst the quarrels\r\nbetween the Tuileries and the pavilion Marsan, between Villele and\r\nPolignac; the Orleanists lived anew through the golden period of the\r\ntourneys between Guizot, Mole, Broglie, Thiers, and Odillon Barrot.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the party of Order—eager for a revision of the\r\nConstitution but disagreed upon the extent of revision—made up of the\r\nLegitimists under Berryer and Falloux and of those under Laroche\r\nJacquelein, together with the tired-out Orleanists under Mole, Broglie,\r\nMontalembert and Odillon Barrot, united with the Bonapartist\r\nRepresentatives in the following indefinite and loosely drawn motion:\r\n\r\n“The undersigned Representatives, with the end in view of restoring to\r\nthe nation the full exercise of her sovereignty, move that the\r\nConstitution be revised.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, they unanimously declared through their\r\nspokesman, Tocqueville, that the National Assembly had not the right to\r\nmove the abolition of the republic, that right being vested only in a\r\nConstitutional Convention. For the rest, the Constitution could be\r\nrevised only in a “legal” way, that is to say, only in case a\r\nthree-fourths majority decided in favor of revision, as prescribed by\r\nthe Constitution. After a six days’ stormy debate, the revision was\r\nrejected on July 19, as was to be foreseen. In its favor 446 votes were\r\ncast, against it 278. The resolute Oleanists, Thiers, Changarnier,\r\netc., voted with the republicans and the Mountain.\r\n\r\nThus the majority of the parliament pronounced itself against the\r\nConstitution, while the Constitution itself pronounced itself for the\r\nminority, and its decision binding. But had not the party of Order on\r\nMay 31, 1850, had it not on June 13, 1849, subordinated the\r\nConstitution to the parliamentary majority? Did not the whole republic\r\nthey had been hitherto having rest upon the subordination of the\r\nConstitutional clauses to the majority decisions of the parliament? Had\r\nthey not left to the democrats the Old Testament superstitious belief\r\nin the letter of the law, and had they not chastised the democrats\r\ntherefor? At this moment, however, revision meant nothing else than the\r\ncontinuance of the Presidential power, as the continuance of the\r\nConstitution meant nothing else than the deposition of Bonaparte. The\r\nparliament had pronounced itself for him, but the Constitution\r\npronounced itself against the parliament. Accordingly, he acted both in\r\nthe sense of the parliament when he tore up the Constitution, and in\r\nthe sense of the Constitution when he chased away the parliament.\r\n\r\nThe parliament pronounced the Constitution, and, thereby, also, its own\r\nreign, “outside of the pale of the majority”; by its decision, it\r\nrepealed the Constitution, and continued the Presidential power, and it\r\nat once declared that neither could the one live nor the other die so\r\nlong as itself existed. The feet of those who were to bury it stood at\r\nthe door. While it was debating the subject of revision, Bonaparte\r\nremoved General Baraguay d’Hilliers, who showed himself irresolute,\r\nfrom the command of the First Military Division, and appointed in his\r\nplace General Magnan, the conqueror of Lyon; the hero of the December\r\ndays, one of his own creatures, who already under Louis Philippe, on\r\nthe occasion of the Boulogne expedition, had somewhat compromised\r\nhimself in his favor.\r\n\r\nBy its decision on the revision, the party of Order proved that it knew\r\nneither how to rule nor how to obey; neither how to live nor how to\r\ndie; neither how to bear with the republic nor how to overthrow it;\r\nneither how to maintain the Constitution nor how to throw it overboard;\r\nneither how to co-operate with the President nor how to break with him.\r\nFrom what quarter did it then, look to for the solution of all the\r\nexisting perplexities? From the calendar, from the course of events. It\r\nceased to assume the control of events. It, accordingly, invited events\r\nto don its authority and also the power to which in its struggle with\r\nthe people, it had yielded one attribute after another until it finally\r\nstood powerless before the same. To the end that the Executive be able\r\nall the more freely to formulate his plan of campaign against it,\r\nstrengthen his means of attack, choose his tools, fortify his\r\npositions, the party of Order decided, in the very midst of this\r\ncritical moment, to step off the stage, and adjourn for three months,\r\nfrom August 10 to November 4.\r\n\r\nNot only was the parliamentary party dissolved into its two great\r\nfactions, not only was each of these dissolved within itself, but the\r\nparty of Order, inside of the parliament, was at odds with the party of\r\nOrder, outside of the parliament. The learned speakers and writers of\r\nthe bourgeoisie, their tribunes and their press, in short, the\r\nideologists of the bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie itself, the\r\nrepresentatives and the represented, stood estranged from, and no\r\nlonger understood one another.\r\n\r\nThe Legitimists in the provinces, with their cramped horizon and their\r\nboundless enthusiasm, charged their parliamentary leaders Berryer and\r\nFalloux with desertion to the Bonapartist camp, and with apostacy from\r\nHenry V. Their lilymind [#1 An allusion to the lilies of the Bourbon\r\ncoat-of-arms] believed in the fall of man, but not in diplomacy.\r\n\r\nMore fatal and completer, though different, was the breach between the\r\ncommercial bourgeoisie and its politicians. It twitted them, not as the\r\nLegitimists did theirs, with having apostatized from their principle,\r\nbut, on the contrary, with adhering to principles that had become\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nI have already indicated that, since the entry of Fould in the\r\nMinistry, that portion of the commercial bourgeoisie that had enjoyed\r\nthe lion’s share in Louis Philippe’s reign, to-wit, the aristocracy of\r\nfinance, had become Bonapartist. Fould not only represented Bonaparte’s\r\ninterests at the Bourse, he represented also the interests of the\r\nBourse with Bonaparte. A passage from the London “Economist,” the\r\nEuropean organ of the aristocracy of finance, described most strikingly\r\nthe attitude of this class. In its issue of February 1, 1851, its Paris\r\ncorrespondent writes: “Now we have it stated from numerous quarters\r\nthat France wishes above all things for repose. The President declares\r\nit in his message to the Legislative Assembly; it is echoed from the\r\ntribune; it is asserted in the journals; it is announced from the\r\npulpit; it is demonstrated by the sensitiveness of the public funds at\r\nthe least prospect of disturbance, and their firmness the instant it is\r\nmade manifest that the Executive is far superior in wisdom and power to\r\nthe factious ex-officials of all former governments.”\r\n\r\nIn its issue of November 29, 1851, the “Economist” declares\r\neditorially: “The President is now recognized as the guardian of order\r\non every Stock Exchange of Europe.” Accordingly, the Aristocracy of\r\nFinance condemned the parliamentary strife of the party of Order with\r\nthe Executive as a “disturbance of order,” and hailed every victory of\r\nthe President over its reputed representatives as a “victory of order.”\r\nUnder “aristocracy of finance” must not, however, be understood merely\r\nthe large bond negotiators and speculators in government securities, of\r\nwhom it may be readily understood that their interests and the\r\ninterests of the Government coincide. The whole modern money trade, the\r\nwhole banking industry, is most intimately interwoven with the public\r\ncredit. Part of their business capital requires to be invested in\r\ninterest-bearing government securities that are promptly convertible\r\ninto money; their deposits, i. e., the capital placed at their disposal\r\nand by them distributed among merchants and industrial establishments,\r\nflow partly out of the dividends on government securities. The whole\r\nmoney market, together with the priests of this market, is part and\r\nparcel of this “aristocracy of finance” at every epoch when the\r\nstability of the government is to them synonymous with “Moses and his\r\nprophets.” This is so even before things have reached the present stage\r\nwhen every deluge threatens to carry away the old governments\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBut the industrial Bourgeoisie also, in its fanaticism for order, was\r\nannoyed at the quarrels of the Parliamentary party of Order with the\r\nExecutive. Thiers, Anglas, Sainte Beuve, etc., received, after their\r\nvote of January 18, on the occasion of the discharge of Changarnier,\r\npublic reprimands from their constituencies, located in the industrial\r\ndistricts, branding their coalition with the Mountain as an act of high\r\ntreason to the cause of order. Although, true enough, the boastful,\r\nvexatious and petty intrigues, through which the struggle of the party\r\nof Order with the President manifested itself, deserved no better\r\nreception, yet notwithstanding, this bourgeois party, that expects of\r\nits representatives to allow the military power to pass without\r\nresistance out of the hands of their own Parliament into those of an\r\nadventurous Pretender, is not worth even the intrigues that were wasted\r\nin its behalf. It showed that the struggle for the maintenance of their\r\npublic interests, of their class interests, of their political power\r\nonly incommoded and displeased them, as a disturbance of their private\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeois dignitaries of the provincial towns, the magistrates,\r\ncommercial judges, etc., with hardly any exception, received Bonaparte\r\neverywhere on his excursions in the most servile manner, even when, as\r\nin Dijon, he attacked the National Assembly and especially the party of\r\nOrder without reserve.\r\n\r\nBusiness being brisk, as still at the beginning of 1851, the commercial\r\nbourgeoisie stormed against every Parliamentary strife, lest business\r\nbe put out of temper. Business being dull, as from the end of February,\r\n1851, on, the bourgeoisie accused the Parliamentary strifes as the\r\ncause of the stand-still, and clamored for quiet in order that business\r\nmay revive. The debates on revision fell just in the bad times. Seeing\r\nthe question now was the to be or not to be of the existing form of\r\ngovernment, the bourgeoisie felt itself all the more justified in\r\ndemanding of its Representatives that they put an end to this\r\ntormenting provisional status, and preserve the “status quo.” This was\r\nno contradiction. By putting an end to the provisional status, it\r\nunderstood its continuance, the indefinite putting off of the moment\r\nwhen a final decision had to be arrived at. The “status quo” could be\r\npreserved in only one of two ways: either by the prolongation of\r\nBonaparte’s term of office or by his constitutional withdrawal and the\r\nelection of Cavaignac. A part of the bourgeoisie preferred the latter\r\nsolution, and knew no better advice to give their Representatives than\r\nto be silent, to avoid the burning point. If their Representatives did\r\nnot speak, so argued they, Bonaparte would not act. They desired an\r\nostrich Parliament that would hide its head, in order not to be seen.\r\nAnother part of the bourgeoisie preferred that Bonaparte, being once in\r\nthe Presidential chair, be left in the Presidential chair, in order\r\nthat everything might continue to run in the old ruts. They felt\r\nindignant that their Parliament did not openly break the Constitution\r\nand resign without further ado. The General Councils of the\r\nDepartments, these provisional representative bodies of the large\r\nbourgeoisie, who had adjourned during the vacation of the National\r\nAssembly since August 25, pronounced almost unanimously for revision,\r\nthat is to say, against the Parliament and for Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nStill more unequivocally than in its falling out with its Parliamentary\r\nRepresentatives, did the bourgeoisie exhibit its wrath at its literary\r\nRepresentatives, its own press. The verdicts of the bourgeois juries,\r\ninflicting excessive fines and shameless sentences of imprisonment for\r\nevery attack of the bourgeois press upon the usurping aspirations of\r\nBonaparte, for every attempt of the press to defend the political\r\nrights of the bourgeoisie against the Executive power, threw, not\r\nFrance alone, but all Europe into amazement.\r\n\r\nWhile on the one hand, as I have indicated, the Parliamentary party of\r\nOrder ordered itself to keep the peace by screaming for peace; and\r\nwhile it pronounced the political rule of the bourgeoisie\r\nirreconcilable with the safety and the existence of the bourgeoisie, by\r\ndestroying with its own hands in its struggle with the other classes of\r\nsociety all the conditions for its own, the Parliamentary regime; on\r\nthe other hand, the mass of the bourgeoisie, outside of the Parliament,\r\nurged Bonaparte—by its servility towards the President, by its insults\r\nto the Parliament, by the brutal treatment of its own press—to suppress\r\nand annihilate its speaking and writing organs, its politicians and its\r\nliterati, its orators’ tribune and its press, to the end that, under\r\nthe protection of a strong and unhampered Government, it might ply its\r\nown private pursuits in safety. It declared unmistakably that it longed\r\nto be rid of its own political rule, in order to escape the troubles\r\nand dangers of ruling.\r\n\r\nAnd this bourgeoisie, that had rebelled against even the Parliamentary\r\nand literary contest for the supremacy of its own class, that had\r\nbetrayed its leaders in this contest, it now has the effrontery to\r\nblame the proletariat for not having risen in its defence in a bloody\r\nstruggle, in a struggle for life! Those bourgeois, who at every turn\r\nsacrificed their common class interests to narrow and dirty private\r\ninterests, and who demanded a similar sacrifice from their own\r\nRepresentatives, now whine that the proletariat has sacrificed their\r\nidea-political to its own material interests! This bourgeois class now\r\nstrikes the attitude of a pure soul, misunderstood and abandoned, at a\r\ncritical moment, by the proletariat, that has been misled by the\r\nSocialists. And its cry finds a general echo in the bourgeois world. Of\r\ncourse, I do not refer to German crossroad politicians and kindred\r\nblockheads. I refer, for instance, to the “Economist,” which, as late\r\nas November 29, 1851, that is to say, four days before the “coup\r\nd’etat” pronounced Bonaparte the “Guardian of Order” and Thiers and\r\nBerryer “Anarchists,” and as early as December 27, 1851, after\r\nBonaparte had silenced those very Anarchists, cries out about the\r\ntreason committed by “the ignorant, untrained and stupid proletaires\r\nagainst the skill, knowledge, discipline, mental influence,\r\nintellectual resources an moral weight of the middle and upper ranks.”\r\nThe stupid, ignorant and contemptible mass was none other than the\r\nbourgeoisie itself.\r\n\r\nFrance had, indeed; experienced a sort of commercial crisis in 1851. At\r\nthe end of February, there was a falling off of exports as compared\r\nwith 1850; in March, business languished and factories shut down; in\r\nApril, the condition of the industrial departments seemed as desperate\r\nas after the February days; in May, business did not yet pick up; as\r\nlate as June 28, the reports of the Bank of France revealed through a\r\ntremendous increase of deposits and an equal decrease of loans on\r\nexchange notes, the standstill of production; not until the middle of\r\nOctober did a steady improvement of business set in. The French\r\nbourgeoisie accounted for this stagnation of business with purely\r\npolitical reasons; it imputed the dull times to the strife between the\r\nParliament and the Executive power, to the uncertainty of a provisional\r\nform of government, to the alarming prospects of May 2, 1852. I shall\r\nnot deny that all these causes did depress some branches of industry in\r\nParis and in the Departments. At any rate, this effect of political\r\ncircumstances was only local and trifling. Is there any other proof\r\nneeded than that the improvement in business set in at the very time\r\nwhen the political situation was growing worse, when the political\r\nhorizon was growing darker, and when at every moment a stroke of\r\nlightning was expected out of the Elysee—in the middle of October? The\r\nFrench bourgeois, whose “skill, knowledge, mental influence and\r\nintellectual resources,” reach no further than his nose, could,\r\nmoreover, during the whole period of the Industrial Exposition in\r\nLondon, have struck with his nose the cause of his own business misery.\r\nAt the same time that, in France, the factories were being closed,\r\ncommercial failures broke out in England. While the industrial panic\r\nreached its height during April and May in France, in England the\r\ncommercial panic reached its height in April and May. The same as the\r\nFrench, the English woolen industries suffered, and, as the French, so\r\ndid the English silk manufacture. Though the English cotton factories\r\nwent on working, it, nevertheless, was not with the same old profit of\r\n1849 and 1850. The only difference was this: that in France, the crisis\r\nwas an industrial, in England it was a commercial one; that while in\r\nFrance the factories stood still, they spread themselves in England,\r\nbut under less favorable circumstances than they had done the years\r\njust previous; that, in France, the export, in England, the import\r\ntrade suffered the heaviest blows. The common cause, which, as a matter\r\nof fact, is not to be looked for with-in the bounds of the French\r\npolitical horizon, was obvious. The years 1849 and 1850 were years of\r\nthe greatest material prosperity, and of an overproduction that did not\r\nmanifest itself until 1851. This was especially promoted at the\r\nbeginning of 1851 by the prospect of the Industrial Exposition; and, as\r\nspecial causes, there were added, first, the failure of the cotton crop\r\nof 1850 and 1851; second, the certainty of a larger cotton crop than\r\nwas expected: first, the rise, then the sudden drop; in short, the\r\noscillations of the cotton market. The crop of raw silk in France had\r\nbeen below the average. Finally, the manufacture of woolen goods had\r\nreceived such an increment since 1849, that the production of wool\r\ncould not keep step with it, and the price of the raw material rose\r\ngreatly out of proportion to the price of the manufactured goods.\r\nAccordingly, we have here in the raw material of three staple articles\r\na threefold material for a commercial crisis. Apart from these special\r\ncircumstances, the seeming crisis of the year 1851 was, after all,\r\nnothing but the halt that overproduction and overspeculation make\r\nregularly in the course of the industrial cycle, before pulling all\r\ntheir forces together in order to rush feverishly over the last\r\nstretch, and arrive again at their point of departure—the General\r\nCommercial Crisis. At such intervals in the history of trade,\r\ncommercial failures break out in England, while, in France, industry\r\nitself is stopped, partly because it is compelled to retreat through\r\nthe competition of the English, that, at such times becomes resistless\r\nin all markets, and partly because, as an industry of luxuries, it is\r\naffected with preference by every stoppage of trade. Thus, besides the\r\ngeneral crisis, France experiences her own national crises, which,\r\nhow-ever, are determined by and conditioned upon the general state of\r\nthe world’s market much more than by local French influences. It will\r\nnot be devoid of interest to contrast the prejudgment of the French\r\nbourgeois with the judgment of the English bourgeois. One of the\r\nlargest Liverpool firms writes in its yearly report of trade for 1851:\r\n“Few years have more completely disappointed the expectations\r\nentertained at their beginning than the year that has just passed;\r\ninstead of the great prosperity, that was unanimously looked forward\r\nto, it proved itself one of the most discouraging years during the last\r\nquarter of a century. This applies, of course, only to the mercantile,\r\nnot to the industrial classes. And yet, surely there were grounds at\r\nthe beginning of the year from which to draw a contrary conclusion; the\r\nstock of products was scanty, capital was abundant, provisions cheap, a\r\nrich autumn was assured, there was uninterrupted peace on the continent\r\nand no political and financial disturbances at home; indeed, never were\r\nthe wings of trade more unshackled. . . . What is this unfavorable\r\nresult to be ascribed to? We believe to excessive trade in imports as\r\nwell as exports. If our merchants do not themselves rein in their\r\nactivity, nothing can keep us going, except a panic every three years.”\r\n\r\nImagine now the French bourgeois, in the midst of this business panic,\r\nhaving his trade-sick brain tortured, buzzed at and deafened with\r\nrumors of a “coup d’etat” and the restoration of universal suffrage;\r\nwith the struggle between the Legislature and the Executive; with the\r\nFronde warfare between Orleanists and Legitimists; with communistic\r\nconspiracies in southern France; with alleged Jacqueries [#2 Peasant\r\nrevolts] in the Departments of Nievre and Cher; with the advertisements\r\nof the several candidates for President; with “social solutions”\r\nhuckstered about by the journals; with the threats of the republicans\r\nto uphold, arms in hand, the Constitution and universal suffrage; with\r\nthe gospels, according to the emigrant heroes “in partibus,” who\r\nannounced the destruction of the world for May 2,—imagine that, and one\r\ncan understand how the bourgeois, in this unspeakable and noisy\r\nconfusion of fusion, revision, prorogation, constitution, conspiracy,\r\ncoalition, emigration, usurpation and revolution, blurts out at his\r\nparliamentary republic: “Rather an End With Fright, Than a Fright\r\nWithout End.”\r\n\r\nBonaparte understood this cry. His perspicacity was sharpened by the\r\ngrowing anxiety of the creditors’ class, who, with every sunset, that\r\nbrought nearer the day of payment, the 2d of May, 1852, saw in the\r\nmotion of the stars a protest against their earthly drafts. They had\r\nbecome regular astrologers The National Assembly had cut off\r\nBonaparte’s hope of a constitutional prolongation of his term; the\r\ncandidature of the Prince of Joinville tolerated no further\r\nvacillation.\r\n\r\nIf ever an event cast its shadow before it long before its occurrence,\r\nit was Bonaparte’s “coup d’etat.” Already on January 29, 1849, barely a\r\nmonth after his election, he had made to Changarnier a proposition to\r\nthat effect. His own Prime Minister. Odillon Barrot, had covertly, in\r\n1849, and Thiers openly in the winter of 1850, revealed the scheme of\r\nthe “coup d’etat.” In May, 1851, Persigny had again sought to win\r\nChangarnier over to the “coup,” and the “Miessager de l’Assemblee”\r\nnewspaper had published this conversation. At every parliamentary\r\nstorm, the Bonapartist papers threatened a “coup,” and the nearer the\r\ncrisis approached, all the louder grew their tone. At the orgies, that\r\nBonaparte celebrated every night with a swell mob of males and females,\r\nevery time the hour of midnight drew nigh and plenteous libations had\r\nloosened the tongues and heated the minds of the revelers, the “coup”\r\nwas resolved upon for the next morning. Swords were then drawn, glasses\r\nclinked, the Representatives were thrown out at the windows, the\r\nimperial mantle fell upon the shoulders of Bonaparte, until the next\r\nmorning again drove away the spook, and astonished Paris learned, from\r\nnot very reserved Vestals and indiscreet Paladins, the danger it had\r\nonce more escaped. During the months of September and October, the\r\nrumors of a “coup d’etat” tumbled close upon one another’s heels. At\r\nthe same time the shadow gathered color, like a confused daguerreotype.\r\nFollow the issues of the European daily press for the months of\r\nSeptember and October, and items like this will be found literally:\r\n\r\n“Rumors of a ‘coup’ fill Paris. The capital, it is said, is to be\r\nfilled with troops by night and the next morning decrees are to be\r\nissued dissolving the National Assembly, placing the Department of the\r\nSeine in state of siege restoring universal suffrage, and appealing to\r\nthe people. Bonaparte is rumored to be looking for Ministers to execute\r\nthese illegal decrees.”\r\n\r\nThe newspaper correspondence that brought this news always close\r\nominously with “postponed.” The “coup” was ever the fixed idea of\r\nBonaparte. With this idea he had stepped again upon French soil. It had\r\nsuch full possession of him that he was constantly betraying and\r\nblabbing it out. He was so weak that he was as constantly giving it up\r\nagain. The shadow of the “coup” had become so familiar a spectre to the\r\nParisians, that they refused to believe it when it finally did appear\r\nin flesh and blood. Consequently, it was neither the reticent\r\nbackwardness of the chief of the “Society of December 10,” nor an\r\nunthought of surprise of the National Assembly that caused the success\r\nof the “coup.” When it succeeded, it did so despite his indiscretion\r\nand with its anticipation—a necessary, unavoidable result of the\r\ndevelopment that had preceded.\r\n\r\nOn October 10, Bonaparte announced to his Ministers his decision to\r\nrestore universal suffrage; on the 16th day they handed in their\r\nresignations; on the 26th Paris learned of the formation of the\r\nThorigny Ministry. The Prefect of Police, Carlier, was simultaneously\r\nreplaced by Maupas; and the chief of the First Military Division\r\nMagnan, concentrated the most reliable regiments in the capital. On\r\nNovember 4, the National Assembly re-opened its sessions. There was\r\nnothing left for it to do but to repeat, in short recapitulation, the\r\ncourse it had traversed, and to prove that it had been buried only\r\nafter it had expired. The first post that it had forfeited in the\r\nstruggle with the Executive was the Ministry. It had solemnly to admit\r\nthis loss by accepting as genuine the Thorigny Ministry, which was but\r\na pretence. The permanent Committee had received Mr. Giraud with\r\nlaughter when he introduced himself in the name of the new Ministers.\r\nSo weak a Ministry for so strong a measure as the restoration of\r\nuniversal suffrage! The question, however, then was to do nothing in,\r\neverything against the parliament.\r\n\r\nOn the very day of its re-opening, the National Assembly received the\r\nmessage from Bonaparte demanding the restoration of universal suffrage\r\nand the repeal of the law of May 31, 1850. On the same day, his\r\nMinisters introduced a decree to that effect. The Assembly promptly\r\nrejected the motion of urgency made by the Ministers, but repealed the\r\nlaw itself, on November 13, by a vote of 355 against 348. Thus it once\r\nmore tore to pieces its own mandate, once more certified to the fact\r\nthat it had transformed itself from a freely chosen representative body\r\nof the nation into the usurpatory parliament of a class; it once more\r\nadmitted that it had itself severed the muscles that connected the\r\nparliamentary head with the body of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhile the Executive power appealed from the National Assembly to the\r\npeople by its motion for the restoration of universal suffrage, the\r\nLegislative power appealed from the people to the Army by its\r\n“Questors’ Bill.” This bill was to establish its right to immediate\r\nrequisitions for troops, to build up a parliamentary army. By thus\r\nappointing the Army umpire between itself and the people, between\r\nitself and Bonaparte; by thus recognizing the Army as the decisive\r\npower in the State, the National Assembly was constrained to admit that\r\nit had long given up all claim to supremacy. By debating the right to\r\nmake requisitions for troops, instead of forthwith collecting them, it\r\nbetrayed its own doubts touching its own power. By thus subsequently\r\nrejecting the “Questors’ Bill,” it publicly confessed it impotence. The\r\nbill fell through with a minority of 108 votes; the Mountain had,\r\naccordingly, thrown the casting vote It now found itself in the\r\npredicament of Buridan’s donkey, not, indeed, between two sacks of hay,\r\nforced to decide which of the two was the more attractive, but between\r\ntwo showers of blows, forced to decide which of the two was the harder;\r\nfear of Changarnier, on one side, fear of Bonaparte, on the other. It\r\nmust be admitted the position was not a heroic one.\r\n\r\nOn November 18, an amendment was moved to the Act, passed by the party\r\nof Order, on municipal elections to the effect that, instead of three\r\nyears, a domicile of one year should suffice. The amendment was lost by\r\na single vote—but this vote, it soon transpired, was a mistake. Owing\r\nto the divisions within its own hostile factions, the party of Order\r\nhad long since forfeited its independent parliamentary majority. It was\r\nnow plain that there was no longer any majority in the parliament. The\r\nNational Assembly had become impotent even to decide. Its atomic parts\r\nwere no longer held together by any cohesive power; it had expended its\r\nlast breath, it was dead.\r\n\r\nFinally, the mass of the bourgeoisie outside of the parliament was once\r\nmore solemnly to confirm its rupture with the bourgeoisie inside of the\r\nparliament a few days before the catastrophe. Thiers, as a\r\nparliamentary hero conspicuously smitten by that incurable\r\ndisease—Parliamentary Idiocy—, had hatched out jointly with the Council\r\nof State, after the death of the parliament, a new parliamentary\r\nintrigue in the shape of a “Responsibility Law,” that was intended to\r\nlock up the President within the walls of the Constitution. The same\r\nas, on September 15, Bonaparte bewitched the fishwives, like a second\r\nMassaniello, on the occasion of laying the corner-stone for the Market\r\nof Paris,—though, it must be admitted, one fishwife was equal to\r\nseventeen Burgraves in real power—; the same as, after the introduction\r\nof the “Questors’ Bill,” he enthused the lieutenants, who were being\r\ntreated at the Elysee;—so, likewise, did he now, on November 25, carry\r\naway with him the industrial bourgeoisie, assembled at the Circus, to\r\nreceive from his hands the prize-medals that had been awarded at the\r\nLondon Industrial Exposition. I here reproduce the typical part of his\r\nspeech, from the “Journal des Debats”:\r\n\r\n“With such unhoped for successes, I am justified to repeat how great\r\nthe French republic would be if she were only allowed to pursue her\r\nreal interests, and reform her institutions, instead of being\r\nconstantly disturbed in this by demagogues, on one side, and, on the\r\nother, by monarchic hallucinations. (Loud, stormy and continued\r\napplause from all parts of the amphitheater). The monarchic\r\nhallucinations hamper all progress and all serious departments of\r\nindustry. Instead of progress, we have struggle only. Men, formerly the\r\nmost zealous supporters of royal authority and prerogative, become the\r\npartisans of a convention that has no purpose other than to weaken an\r\nauthority that is born of universal suffrage. (Loud and prolonged\r\napplause). We see men, who have suffered most from the revolution and\r\ncomplained bitterest of it, provoking a new one for the sole purpose of\r\nputting fetters on the will of the nation. . . . I promise you peace\r\nfor the future.” (Bravo! Bravo! Stormy bravos.)\r\n\r\nThus the industrial bourgeoisie shouts its servile “Bravo!” to the\r\n“coup d’etat” of December 2, to the destruction of the parliament, to\r\nthe downfall of their own reign, to the dictatorship of Bonaparte. The\r\nrear of the applause of November 25 was responded to by the roar of\r\ncannon on December 4, and the house of Mr. Sallandrouze, who had been\r\nloudest in applauding, was the one demolished by most of the bombs.\r\n\r\nCromwell, when he dissolved the Long Parliament, walked alone into its\r\nmidst, pulled out his watch in order that the body should not continue\r\nto exist one minute beyond the term fixed for it by him, and drove out\r\neach individual member with gay and humorous invectives. Napoleon,\r\nsmaller than his prototype, at least went on the 18th Brumaire into the\r\nlegislative body, and, though in a tremulous voice, read to it its\r\nsentence of death. The second Bonaparte, who, moreover, found himself\r\nin possession of an executive power very different from that of either\r\nCromwell or Napoleon, did not look for his model in the annals of\r\nuniversal history, but in the annals of the “Society of December 10,”\r\nin the annals of criminal jurisprudence. He robs the Bank of France of\r\ntwenty-five million francs; buys General Magnan with one million and\r\nthe soldiers with fifteen francs and a drink to each; comes secretly\r\ntogether with his accomplices like a thief by night; has the houses of\r\nthe most dangerous leaders in the parliament broken into; Cavalignac,\r\nLamorciere, Leflo, Changarnier, Charras, Thiers, Baze, etc., taken out\r\nof their beds; the principal places of Paris, the building of the\r\nparliament included, occupied with troops; and, early the next morning,\r\nloud-sounding placards posted on all the walls proclaiming the\r\ndissolution of the National Assembly and of the Council of State, the\r\nrestoration of universal suffrage, and the placing of the Department of\r\nthe Seine under the state of siege. In the same way he shortly after\r\nsneaked into the “Moniteur” a false document, according to which\r\ninfluential parliamentary names had grouped themselves round him in a\r\nCommittee of the Nation.\r\n\r\nAmidst cries of “Long live the Republic!”, the rump-parliament,\r\nassembled at the Mayor’s building of the Tenth Arrondissement, and\r\ncomposed mainly of Legitimists and Orleanists, resolves to depose\r\nBonaparte; it harangues in vain the gaping mass gathered before the\r\nbuilding, and is finally dragged first, under the escort of African\r\nsharpshooters, to the barracks of Orsay, and then bundled into\r\nconvicts’ wagons and transported to the prisons of Mazas, Ham and\r\nVincennes. Thus ended the party of Order, the Legislative Assembly and\r\nthe February revolution.\r\n\r\nBefore hastening to the end, let us sum up shortly the plan of its\r\nhistory:\r\n\r\nI.—First Period. From February 24 to May 4, 1848. February period.\r\nPrologue. Universal fraternity swindle.\r\n\r\nII.—Second Period. Period in which the republic is constituted, and of\r\nthe Constitutive National Assembly.\r\n\r\n1. May 4 to June 25, 1848. Struggle of all the classes against the\r\nhouse of Mr. proletariat. Defeat of the proletariat in the June days.\r\n\r\n2. June 25 to December 10, 1848. Dictatorship of the pure bourgeois\r\nrepublicans. Drafting of the Constitution. The state of siege hangs\r\nover Paris. The Bourgeois dictatorship set aside on December 10 by the\r\nelection of Bonaparte as President.\r\n\r\n3. December 20, 1848, to May 20, 1849. Struggle of the Constitutive\r\nAssembly with Bonaparte and with the united party of Order. Death of\r\nthe Constitutive Assembly. Downfall of the republican bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nIII.—Third Period. Period of the constitutional republic and of the\r\nLegislative National Assembly.\r\n\r\n1. May 29 to June 13, 1849. Struggle of the small traders’, middle\r\nclass with the bourgeoisie and with Bonaparte. Defeat of the small\r\ntraders’ democracy.\r\n\r\n2. June 13, 1849, to May, 1850. Parliamentary dictatorship of the party\r\nof Order. Completes its reign by the abolition of universal suffrage,\r\nbut loses the parliamentary Ministry.\r\n\r\n3. May 31, 1850, to December 2, 1851. Struggle between the\r\nparliamentary bourgeoisie and Bonaparte.\r\n\r\na. May 31, 1850, to January 12, 1851. The parliament loses the supreme\r\ncommand over the Army.\r\n\r\nb. January 12 to April 11, 1851. The parliament succumbs in the\r\nattempts to regain possession of the administrative power. The party of\r\nOrder loses its independent parliamentary majority. Its coalition with\r\nthe republicans and the Mountain.\r\n\r\nc. April 11 to October 9, 1851. Attempts at revision, fusion and\r\nprorogation. The party of Order dissolves into its component parts. The\r\nbreach between the bourgeois parliament and the bourgeois press, on the\r\none hand, and the bourgeois mass, on the other, becomes permanent.\r\n\r\nd. October 9 to December 2, 1851. Open breach between the parliament\r\nand the executive power. It draws up its own decree of death, and goes\r\nunder, left in the lurch by its own class, by the Army, and by all the\r\nother classes. Downfall of the parliamentary regime and of the reign of\r\nthe bourgeoisie. Bonaparte’s triumph. Parody of the imperialist\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Social Republic appeared as a mere phrase, as a prophecy on the\r\nthreshold of the February Revolution; it was smothered in the blood of\r\nthe Parisian proletariat during the days of 1848 but it stalks about as\r\na spectre throughout the following acts of the drama. The Democratic\r\nRepublic next makes its bow; it goes out in a fizzle on June 13, 1849,\r\nwith its runaway small traders; but, on fleeing, it scatters behind it\r\nall the more bragging announcements of what it means do to. The\r\nParliamentary Republic, together with the bourgeoisie, then\r\nappropriates the whole stage; it lives its life to the full extent of\r\nits being; but the 2d of December, 1851, buries it under the\r\nterror-stricken cry of the allied royalists: “Long live the Republic!”\r\n\r\nThe French bourgeoisie reared up against the reign of the working\r\nproletariat;—it brought to power the slum-proletariat, with the chief\r\nof the “Society of December 10” at its head. It kept France in\r\nbreathless fear over the prospective terror of “red anarchy;”—Bonaparte\r\ndiscounted the prospect when, on December 4, he had the leading\r\ncitizens of the Boulevard Montmartre and the Boulevard des Italiens\r\nshot down from their windows by the grog-inspired “Army of Order.” It\r\nmade the apotheosis of the sabre; now the sabre rules it. It destroyed\r\nthe revolutionary press;—now its own press is annihilated. It placed\r\npublic meetings under police surveillance;—now its own salons are\r\nsubject to police inspection. It disbanded the democratic National\r\nGuards;—now its own National Guard is disbanded. It instituted the\r\nstate of siege;—now itself is made subject thereto. It supplanted the\r\njury by military commissions;—now military commissions supplant its own\r\njuries. It subjected the education of the people to the parsons’\r\ninterests;—the parsons’ interests now subject it to their own systems.\r\nIt ordered transportations without trial;—now itself is transported\r\nwithout trial. It suppressed every movement of society with physical\r\nforce;—now every movement of its own class is suppressed by physical\r\nforce. Out of enthusiasm for the gold bag, it rebelled against its own\r\npolitical leaders and writers;—now, its political leaders and writers\r\nare set aside, but the gold hag is plundered, after the mouth of the\r\nbourgeoisie has been gagged and its pen broken. The bourgeoisie\r\ntirelessly shouted to the revolution, in the language of St. Orsenius\r\nto the Christians: “Fuge, Tace, Quiesce!”—flee, be silent, submit!—;\r\nBonaparte shouts to the bourgeoisie: “Fuge, Tace, Oniesce!”—flee, be\r\nsilent, submit!\r\n\r\nThe French bourgeoisie had long since solved Napoleon’s dilemma: “Dans\r\ncinquante ans l’Europe sera republicaine ou cosaque.” [#1 Within fifty\r\nyears Europe will be either republican or Cossack.] It found the\r\nsolution in the “republique cosaque.” [#2 Cossack republic.] No Circe\r\ndistorted with wicked charms the work of art of the bourgeois republic\r\ninto a monstrosity. That republic lost nothing but the appearance of\r\ndecency. The France of to-day was ready-made within the womb of the\r\nParliamentary republic. All that was wanted was a bayonet thrust, in\r\norder that the bubble burst, and the monster leap forth to sight.\r\n\r\nWhy did not the Parisian proletariat rise after the 2d of December?\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the bourgeoisie was as yet merely decreed; the decree\r\nwas not yet executed. Any earnest uprising of the proletariat would\r\nhave forthwith revived this bourgeoisie, would have brought on its\r\nreconciliation with the army, and would have insured a second June rout\r\nto the workingmen.\r\n\r\nOn December 4, the proletariat was incited to fight by Messrs.\r\nBourgeois \u0026 Small-Trader. On the evening of that day, several legions\r\nof the National Guard promised to appear armed and uniformed on the\r\nplace of battle. This arose from the circumstance that Messrs.\r\nBourgeois \u0026 Small-Trader had got wind that, in one of his decrees of\r\nDecember 2, Bonaparte abolished the secret ballot, and ordered them to\r\nenter the words “Yes” and “No” after their names in the official\r\nregister. Bonaparte took alarm at the stand taken on December 4. During\r\nthe night he caused placards to be posted on all the street corners of\r\nParis, announcing the restoration of the secret ballot. Messrs.\r\nBourgeois \u0026 Small-Trader believed they had gained their point. The\r\nabsentees, the next morning, were Messieurs. Bourgeois \u0026 Small-Trader.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of December 1 and 2, the Parisian proletariat was\r\nrobbed of its leaders and chiefs of barricades by a raid of\r\nBonaparte’s. An army without officers, disinclined by the recollections\r\nof June, 1848 and 1849, and May, 1850, to fight under the banner of the\r\nMontagnards, it left to its vanguard, the secret societies, the work of\r\nsaving the insurrectionary honor of Paris, which the bourgeoisie had\r\nyielded to the soldiery so submissively that Bonaparte was later\r\njustified in disarming the National Guard upon the scornful ground that\r\nhe feared their arms would be used against themselves by the\r\nAnarchists!\r\n\r\n“C’est Ic triomphe complet et definitif du Socialism!” Thus did Guizot\r\ncharacterize the 2d of December. But, although the downfall of the\r\nparliamentary republic carries with it the germ of the triumph of the\r\nproletarian revolution, its immediate and tangible result was the\r\ntriumph of Bonaparte over parliament, of the Executive over the\r\nLegislative power, of force without phrases over the force of phrases.\r\nIn the parliament, the nation raised its collective will to the dignity\r\nof law, i.e., it raised the law of the ruling class to the dignity of\r\nits collective will. Before the Executive power, the nation abdicates\r\nall will of its own, and submits to the orders of an outsider of\r\nAuthority. In contrast with the Legislative, the Executive power\r\nexpresses the heteronomy of the nation in contrast with its autonomy.\r\nAccordingly, France seems to have escaped the despotism of a class only\r\nin order to fall under the despotism of an individual, under the\r\nauthority, at that of an individual without authority The struggle\r\nseems to settle down to the point where all classes drop down on their\r\nknees, equally impotent and equally dumb.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the revolution is thoroughgoing. It still is on its\r\npassage through purgatory. It does its work methodically: Down to\r\nDecember 2, 1851, it had fulfilled one-half of its programme, it now\r\nfulfils the other half. It first ripens the power of the Legislature\r\ninto fullest maturity in order to be able to overthrow it. Now that it\r\nhas accomplished that, the revolution proceeds to ripen the power of\r\nthe Executive into equal maturity; it reduces this power to its purest\r\nexpression; isolates it; places it before itself as the sole subject\r\nfor reproof in order to concentrate against it all the revolutionary\r\nforces of destruction. When the revolution shall have accomplished this\r\nsecond part of its preliminary programme, Europe will jump up from her\r\nseat to exclaim: “Well hast thou grubbed, old mole!”\r\n\r\nThe Executive power, with its tremendous bureaucratic and military\r\norganization; with its wide-spreading and artificial machinery of\r\ngovernment—an army of office-holders, half a million strong, together\r\nwith a military force of another million men—; this fearful body of\r\nparasites, that coils itself like a snake around French society,\r\nstopping all its pores, originated at the time of the absolute\r\nmonarchy, along with the decline of feudalism, which it helped to\r\nhasten. The princely privileges of the landed proprietors and cities\r\nwere transformed into so many at-tributes of the Executive power; the\r\nfeudal dignitaries into paid office-holders; and the confusing design\r\nof conflicting medieval seigniories, into the well regulated plan of a\r\ngovernment, work is subdivided and centralized as in the factory. The\r\nfirst French revolution, having as a mission to sweep away all local,\r\nterritorial, urban and provincial special privileges, with the object\r\nof establishing the civic unity of the nation, was hound to develop\r\nwhat the absolute monarchy had begun—the work of centralization,\r\ntogether with the range, the attributes and the menials of government.\r\nNapoleon completed this governmental machinery. The Legitimist and the\r\nJuly Monarchy contribute nothing thereto, except a greater subdivision\r\nof labor, that grew in the same measure as the division and subdivision\r\nof labor within bourgeois society raised new groups and interests,\r\ni.e., new material for the administration of government. Each Common\r\ninterest was in turn forthwith removed from society, set up against it\r\nas a higher Collective interest, wrested from the individual activity\r\nof the members of society, and turned into a subject for governmental\r\nadministration, from the bridges, the school house and the communal\r\nproperty of a village community, up to the railroads, the national\r\nwealth and the national University of France. Finally, the\r\nparliamentary republic found itself, in its struggle against the\r\nrevolution, compelled, with its repressive measures, to strengthen the\r\nmeans and the centralization of the government. Each overturn, instead\r\nof breaking up, carried this machine to higher perfection. The parties,\r\nthat alternately wrestled for supremacy, looked upon the possession of\r\nthis tremendous governmental structure as the principal spoils of their\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, under the absolute monarchy, was only the means whereby\r\nthe first revolution, and under Napoleon, to prepare the class rule of\r\nthe bourgeoisie; under the restoration, under Louis Philippe, and under\r\nthe parliamentary republic, it was the instrument of the ruling class,\r\nhowever eagerly this class strained after autocracy. Not before the\r\nadvent of the second Bonaparte does the government seem to have made\r\nitself fully independent. The machinery of government has by this time\r\nso thoroughly fortified itself against society, that the chief of the\r\n“Society of December 10” is thought good enough to be at its head; a\r\nfortune-hunter, run in from abroad, is raised on its shield by a\r\ndrunken soldiery, bought by himself with liquor and sausages, and whom\r\nhe is forced ever again to throw sops to. Hence the timid despair, the\r\nsense of crushing humiliation and degradation that oppresses the breast\r\nof France and makes her to choke. She feels dishonored.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the French Government does not float in the air. Bonaparte\r\nrepresents an economic class, and that the most numerous in the\r\ncommonweal of France—the Allotment Farmer. [#4 The first French\r\nRevolution distributed the bulk of the territory of France, held at the\r\ntime by the feudal lords, in small patches among the cultivators of the\r\nsoil. This allotment of lands created the French farmer class.]\r\n\r\nAs the Bourbons are the dynasty of large landed property, as the\r\nOrleans are the dynasty of money, so are the Bonapartes the dynasty of\r\nthe farmer, i.e. of the French masses. Not the Bonaparte, who threw\r\nhimself at the feet of the bourgeois parliament, but the Bonaparte, who\r\nswept away the bourgeois parliament, is the elect of this farmer class.\r\nFor three years the cities had succeeded in falsifying the meaning of\r\nthe election of December 10, and in cheating the farmer out of the\r\nrestoration of the Empire. The election of December 10, 1848, is not\r\ncarried out until the “coup d’etat” of December 2, 1851.\r\n\r\nThe allotment farmers are an immense mass, whose individual members\r\nlive in identical conditions, without, however, entering into manifold\r\nrelations with one another. Their method of production isolates them\r\nfrom one another, instead of drawing them into mutual intercourse. This\r\nisolation is promoted by the poor means of communication in France,\r\ntogether with the poverty of the farmers themselves. Their field of\r\nproduction, the small allotment of land that each cultivates, allows no\r\nroom for a division of labor, and no opportunity for the application of\r\nscience; in other words, it shuts out manifoldness of development,\r\ndiversity of talent, and the luxury of social relations. Every single\r\nfarmer family is almost self-sufficient; itself produces directly the\r\ngreater part of what it consumes; and it earns its livelihood more by\r\nmeans of an interchange with nature than by intercourse with society.\r\nWe have the allotted patch of land, the farmer and his family;\r\nalongside of that another allotted patch of land, another farmer and\r\nanother family. A bunch of these makes up a village; a bunch of\r\nvillages makes up a Department. Thus the large mass of the French\r\nnation is constituted by the simple addition of equal magnitudes—much\r\nas a bag with potatoes constitutes a potato-bag. In so far as millions\r\nof families live under economic conditions that separate their mode of\r\nlife, their interests and their culture from those of the other\r\nclasses, and that place them in an attitude hostile toward the latter,\r\nthey constitute a class; in so far as there exists only a local\r\nconnection among these farmers, a connection which the individuality\r\nand exclusiveness of their interests prevent from generating among them\r\nany unity of interest, national connections, and political\r\norganization, they do not constitute a class. Consequently, they are\r\nunable to assert their class interests in their own name, be it by a\r\nparliament or by convention. They can not represent one another, they\r\nmust themselves be represented. Their representative must at the same\r\ntime appear as their master, as an authority over them, as an unlimited\r\ngovernmental power, that protects them from above, bestows rain and\r\nsunshine upon them. Accordingly, the political influence of the\r\nallotment farmer finds its ultimate expression in an Executive power\r\nthat subjugates the commonweal to its own autocratic will.\r\n\r\nHistoric tradition has given birth to the superstition among the French\r\nfarmers that a man named Napoleon would restore to them all manner of\r\nglory. Now, then, an individual turns I up, who gives himself out as\r\nthat man because, obedient to the “Code Napoleon,” which provides that\r\n“La recherche de la paternite est interdite,” [#5 The inquiry into\r\npaternity is forbidden.] he carries the name of Napoleon. [#6 L. N.\r\nBonaparte is said to have been an illegitimate son.] After a\r\nvagabondage of twenty years, and a series of grotesque adventures, the\r\nmyth is verified, and that man becomes the Emperor of the French. The\r\nrooted thought of the Nephew becomes a reality because it coincided\r\nwith the rooted thought of the most numerous class among the French.\r\n\r\n“But,” I shall be objected to, “what about the farmers’ uprisings over\r\nhalf France, the raids of the Army upon the farmers, the wholesale\r\nimprisonment and transportation of farmers?”\r\n\r\nIndeed, since Louis XIV., France has not experienced such persecutions\r\nof the farmer on the ground of his demagogic machinations.\r\n\r\nBut this should be well understood: The Bonaparte dynasty does not\r\nrepresent the revolutionary, it represents the conservative farmer; it\r\ndoes not represent the farmer, who presses beyond his own economic\r\nconditions, his little allotment of land it represents him rather who\r\nwould confirm these conditions; it does not represent the rural\r\npopulation, that, thanks to its own inherent energy, wishes, jointly\r\nwith the cities to overthrow the old order, it represents, on the\r\ncontrary, the rural population that, hide-bound in the old order, seeks\r\nto see itself, together with its allotments, saved and favored by the\r\nghost of the Empire; it represents, not the intelligence, but the\r\nsuperstition of the farmer; not his judgment, but his bias; not his\r\nfuture, but his past; not his modern Cevennes; [#7 The Cevennes were\r\nthe theater of the most numerous revolutionary uprisings of the farmer\r\nclass.] but his modern Vendee. [#8 La Vendee was the theater of\r\nprotracted reactionary uprisings of the farmer class under the first\r\nRevolution.]\r\n\r\nThe three years’ severe rule of the parliamentary republic had freed a\r\npart of the French farmers from the Napoleonic illusion, and, though\r\neven only superficially; had revolutionized them The bourgeoisie threw\r\nthem, however, violently back every time that they set themselves in\r\nmotion. Under the parliamentary republic, the modern wrestled with the\r\ntraditional consciousness of the French farmer. The process went on in\r\nthe form of a continuous struggle between the school teachers and the\r\nparsons;—the bourgeoisie knocked the school teachers down. For the\r\nfirst time, the farmer made an effort to take an independent stand in\r\nthe government of the country; this manifested itself in the prolonged\r\nconflicts of the Mayors with the Prefects;—the bourgeoisie deposed the\r\nMayors. Finally, during period of the parliamentary republic, the\r\nfarmers of several localities rose against their own product, the\r\nArmy;—the bourgeoisie punished them with states of siege and\r\nexecutions. And this is the identical bourgeoisie, that now howls over\r\nthe “stupidity of the masses,” over the “vile multitude,” which, it\r\nclaims, betrayed it to Bonaparte. Itself has violently fortified the\r\nimperialism of the farmer class; it firmly maintained the conditions\r\nthat Constitute the birth-place of this farmer-religion. Indeed, the\r\nbourgeoisie has every reason to fear the stupidity of the masses—so\r\nlong as they remain conservative; and their intelligence—so soon as\r\nthey become revolutionary.\r\n\r\nIn the revolts that took place after the “coup d’etat” a part of the\r\nFrench farmers protested, arms in hand, against their own vote of\r\nDecember 10, 1848. The school house had, since 1848, sharpened their\r\nwits. But they had bound themselves over to the nether world of\r\nhistory, and history kept them to their word. Moreover, the majority of\r\nthis population was still so full of prejudices that, just in the\r\n“reddest” Departments, it voted openly for Bonaparte. The National\r\nAssembly prevented, as it thought, this population from walking; the\r\nfarmers now snapped the fetters which the cities had struck upon the\r\nwill of the country districts. In some places they even indulged the\r\ngrotesque hallucination of a “Convention together with a Napoleon.”\r\n\r\nAfter the first revolution had converted the serf farmers into\r\nfreeholders, Napoleon fixed and regulated the conditions under which,\r\nunmolested, they could exploit the soil of France, that had just fallen\r\ninto their hands, and expiate the youthful passion for property. But\r\nthat which now bears the French farmer down is that very allotment of\r\nland, it is the partition of the soil, the form of ownership, which\r\nNapoleon had consolidated. These are the material condition that turned\r\nFrench feudal peasant into a small or allotment farmer, and Napoleon\r\ninto an Emperor. Two generations have sufficed to produce the\r\ninevitable result the progressive deterioration of agriculture, and the\r\nprogressive encumbering of the agriculturist The “Napoleonic” form of\r\nownership, which, at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the\r\ncondition for the emancipation and enrichment of the French rural\r\npopulation, has, in the course of the century, developed into the law\r\nof their enslavement and pauperism. Now, then, this very law is the\r\nfirst of the “idees Napoleoniennes,” which the second Bonaparte must\r\nuphold. If he still shares with the farmers the illusion of seeking,\r\nnot in the system of the small allotment itself, but outside of that\r\nsystem, in the influence of secondary conditions, the cause of their\r\nruin, his experiments are bound to burst like soap-bubbles against the\r\nmodern system of production.\r\n\r\nThe economic development of the allotment system has turned bottom\r\nupward the relation of the farmer to the other classes of society.\r\nUnder Napoleon, the parceling out of the agricultural lands into small\r\nallotments supplemented in the country the free competition and the\r\nincipient large production of the cities. The farmer class was the\r\nubiquitous protest against the aristocracy of land, just then\r\noverthrown. The roots that the system of small allotments cast into the\r\nsoil of France, deprived feudalism of all nutriment. Its boundary-posts\r\nconstituted the natural buttress of the bourgeoisie against every\r\nstroke of the old overlords. But in the course of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the City Usurer stepped into the shoes of the Feudal Lord, the\r\nMortgage substituted the Feudal Duties formerly yielded by the soil,\r\nbourgeois Capital took the place of the aristocracy of Landed Property.\r\nThe former allotments are now only a pretext that allows the capitalist\r\nclass to draw profit, interest and rent from agricultural lands, and to\r\nleave to the farmer himself the task of seeing to it that he knock out\r\nhis wages. The mortgage indebtedness that burdens the soil of France\r\nimposes upon the French farmer class they payment of an interest as\r\ngreat as the annual interest on the whole British national debt. In\r\nthis slavery of capital, whither its development drives it\r\nirresistibly, the allotment system has transformed the mass of the\r\nFrench nation into troglodytes. Sixteen million farmers (women and\r\nchildren included), house in hovels most of which have only one\r\nopening, some two, and the few most favored ones three. Windows are to\r\na house what the five senses are to the head. The bourgeois social\r\norder, which, at the beginning of the century, placed the State as a\r\nsentinel before the newly instituted allotment, and that manured this\r\nwith laurels, has become a vampire that sucks out its heart-blood and\r\nits very brain, and throws it into the alchemist’s pot of capital. The\r\n“Code Napoleon” is now but the codex of execution, of sheriff’s sales\r\nand of intensified taxation. To the four million (children, etc.,\r\nincluded) official paupers, vagabonds, criminals and prostitutes, that\r\nFrance numbers, must be added five million souls who hover over the\r\nprecipice of life, and either sojourn in the country itself, or float\r\nwith their rags and their children from the country to the cities, and\r\nfrom the cities back to the country. Accordingly, the interests of the\r\nfarmers are no longer, as under Napoleon, in harmony but in conflict\r\nwith the interests of the bourgeoisie, i.e., with capital; they find\r\ntheir natural allies and leaders among the urban proletariat, whose\r\nmission is the overthrow of the bourgeois social order. But the “strong\r\nand unlimited government”—and this is the second of the “idees\r\nNapoleoniennes,” which the second Napoleon has to carried out—, has for\r\nits mission the forcible defence of this very “material” social order,\r\na “material order” that furnishes the slogan in Bonaparte’s\r\nproclamations against the farmers in revolt.\r\n\r\nAlong with the mortgage, imposed by capital upon the farmer’s\r\nallotment, this is burdened by taxation. Taxation is the fountain of\r\nlife to the bureaucracy, the Army, the parsons and the court, in short\r\nto the whole apparatus of the Executive power. A strong government, and\r\nheavy taxes are identical. The system of ownership, involved in the\r\nsystem of allotments lends itself by nature for the groundwork of a\r\npowerful and numerous bureaucracy: it produces an even level of\r\nconditions and of persons over the whole surface of the country; it,\r\ntherefore, allows the exercise of an even influence upon all parts of\r\nthis even mass from a high central point downwards: it annihilates the\r\naristocratic gradations between the popular masses and the Government;\r\nit, consequently, calls from all sides for the direct intervention of\r\nthe Government and for the intervention of the latter’s immediate\r\norgans; and, finally, it produces an unemployed excess of population,\r\nthat finds no room either in the country or in the cities, that,\r\nconsequently, snatches after public office as a sort of dignified alms,\r\nand provokes the creation of further offices. With the new markets,\r\nwhich he opened at the point of the bayonet, and with the plunder of\r\nthe continent, Napoleon returned to the farmer class with interest the\r\ntaxes wrung from them. These taxes were then a goad to the industry of\r\nthe farmer, while now, on the contrary, they rob his industry of its\r\nlast source of support, and completely sap his power to resist poverty.\r\nIndeed, an enormous bureaucracy, richly gallooned and well fed is that\r\n“idee Napoleonienne” that above all others suits the requirements of\r\nthe second Bonaparte. How else should it be, seeing he is forced to\r\nraise alongside of the actual classes of society, an artificial class,\r\nto which the maintenance of his own regime must be a knife-and-fork\r\nquestion? One of his first financial operations was, accordingly, the\r\nraising of the salaries of the government employees to their former\r\nstandard and the creation of new sinecures.\r\n\r\nAnother “idee Napoleonienne” is the rule of the parsons as an\r\ninstrument of government. But while the new-born allotment, in harmony\r\nwith society, in its dependence upon the powers of nature, and in its\r\nsubordination to the authority that protected it from above, was\r\nnaturally religious, the debt-broken allotment, on the contrary, at\r\nodds with society and authority, and driven beyond its own narrow\r\nbounds, becomes as naturally irreligious. Heaven was quite a pretty\r\ngift thrown in with the narrow strip of land that had just been won,\r\nall the more as it makes the weather; it, however, becomes an insult\r\nfrom the moment it is forced upon the farmer as a substitute for his\r\nallotment. Then the parson appears merely as the anointed blood-hound\r\nof the earthly police,—yet another “idee Napoleonienne.” The expedition\r\nagainst Rome will next time take place in France, but in a reverse\r\nsense from that of M. de Montalembert.\r\n\r\nFinally, the culminating point of the “idees Napoleoniennes” is the\r\npreponderance of the Army. The Army was the “point of honor” with the\r\nallotment farmers: it was themselves turned into masters, defending\r\nabroad their newly established property, glorifying their recently\r\nconquered nationality, plundering and revolutionizing the world. The\r\nuniform was their State costume; war was their poetry; the allotment,\r\nexpanded and rounded up in their phantasy, was the fatherland; and\r\npatriotism became the ideal form of property. But the foe, against whom\r\nthe French farmer must now defend his property, are not the Cossacks,\r\nthey are the sheriffs and the tax collectors. The allotment no longer\r\nlies in the so-called fatherland, but in the register of mortgages. The\r\nArmy itself no longer is the flower of the youth of the farmers, it is\r\nthe swamp-blossom of the slum-proletariat of the farmer class. It\r\nconsists of “remplacants,” substitutes, just as the second Bonaparte\r\nhimself is but a “remplacant,” a substitute, for Napoleon. Its feats of\r\nheroism are now performed in raids instituted against farmers and in\r\nthe service of the police;—and when the internal contradictions of his\r\nown system shall drive the chief of the “Society of December 10” across\r\nthe French frontier, that Army will, after a few bandit-raids, gather\r\nno laurels but only hard knocks.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all the “idees Napoleoniennes” are the ideas of the\r\nundeveloped and youthfully fresh allotment; they are an absurdity for\r\nthe allotment that now survives. They are only the hallucinations of\r\nits death struggle; words turned to hollow phrases, spirits turned to\r\nspooks. But this parody of the Empire was requisite in order to free\r\nthe mass of the French nation from the weight of tradition, and to\r\nelaborate sharply the contrast between Government and Society. Along\r\nwith the progressive decay of the allotment, the governmental\r\nstructure, reared upon it, breaks down. The centralization of\r\nGovernment, required by modern society, rises only upon the ruins of\r\nthe military and bureaucratic governmental machinery that was forged in\r\ncontrast to feudalism.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the French farmers’ class solve to us the riddle of\r\nthe general elections of December 20 and 21, that led the second\r\nBonaparte to the top of Sinai, not to receive, but to decree laws.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie had now, manifestly, no choice but to elect Bonaparte.\r\nWhen at the Council of Constance, the puritans complained of the sinful\r\nlife of the Popes, and moaned about the need of a reform in morals,\r\nCardinal d’Ailly thundered into their faces: “Only the devil in his Own\r\nperson can now save the Catholic Church, and you demand angels.” So,\r\nlikewise, did the French bourgeoisie cry out after the “coup d’etat”:\r\n“Only the chief of the ‘Society of December 10’ can now save bourgeois\r\nsociety, only theft can save property, only perjury religion, only\r\nbastardy the family, only disorder order!”\r\n\r\nBonaparte, as autocratic Executive power, fulfills his mission to\r\nsecure “bourgeois order.” But the strength of this bourgeois order lies\r\nin the middle class. He feels himself the representative of the middle\r\nclass, and issues his decrees in that sense. Nevertheless, he is\r\nsomething only because he has broken the political power of this class,\r\nand daily breaks it anew. Hence he feels himself the adversary of the\r\npolitical and the literary power of the middle class. But, by\r\nprotecting their material, he nourishes anew their political power.\r\nConsequently, the cause must be kept alive, but the result, wherever it\r\nmanifests itself, swept out of existence. But this procedure is\r\nimpossible without slight mistakings of causes and effects, seeing that\r\nboth, in their mutual action and reaction, lose their distinctive\r\nmarks. Thereupon, new decrees, that blur the line of distinction.\r\nBonaparte, furthermore, feels himself, as against the bourgeoisie, the\r\nrepresentative of the farmer and the people in general, who, within\r\nbourgeois society, is to render the lower classes of society happy. To\r\nthis end, new decrees, intended to exploit the “true Socialists,”\r\ntogether with their governmental wisdom. But, above all, Bonaparte\r\nfeels himself the chief of the “Society of December 10,” the\r\nrepresentative of the slum-proletariat, to which he himself, his\r\nimmediate surroundings, his Government, and his army alike belong, the\r\nmain object with all of whom is to be good to themselves, and draw\r\nCalifornian tickets out of the national treasury. An he affirms his\r\nchieftainship of the “Society of December 10” with decrees, without\r\ndecrees, and despite decrees.\r\n\r\nThis contradictory mission of the man explains the contradictions of\r\nhis own Government, and that confused groping about, that now seeks to\r\nwin, then to humiliate now this class and then that, and finishes by\r\narraying against itself all the classes; whose actual insecurity\r\nconstitutes a highly comical contrast with the imperious, categoric\r\nstyle of the Government acts, copied closely from the Uncle.\r\n\r\nIndustry and commerce, i.e., the business of the middle class, are to\r\nbe made to blossom in hot-house style under the “strong Government.”\r\nLoans for a number of railroad grants. But the Bonapartist\r\nslum-proletariat is to enrich itself. Peculation is carried on with\r\nrailroad concessions on the Bourse by the initiated; but no capital is\r\nforthcoming for the railroads. The bank then pledges itself to make\r\nadvances upon railroad stock; but the bank is itself to be exploited;\r\nhence, it must be cajoled; it is released of the obligation to publish\r\nits reports weekly. Then follows a leonine treaty between the bank and\r\nthe Government. The people are to be occupied: public works are\r\nordered; but the public works raise the tax rates upon the people;\r\nthereupon the taxes are reduced by an attack upon the national\r\nbond-holders through the conversion of the five per cent “rentes” [#9\r\nThe name of the French national bonds.] into four-and-halves. Yet the\r\nmiddle class must again be tipped: to this end, the tax on wine is\r\ndoubled for the people, who buy it at retail, and is reduced to\r\none-half for the middle class, that drink it at wholesale. Genuine\r\nlabor organizations are dissolved, but promises are made of future\r\nwonders to accrue from organization. The farmers are to be helped:\r\nmortgage-banks are set up that must promote the indebtedness; of the\r\nfarmer and the concentration of property but again, these banks are to\r\nbe utilized especially to the end of squeezing money out of the\r\nconfiscated estates of the House of Orleans; no capitalist will listen\r\nto this scheme, which, moreover, is not mentioned in the decree; the\r\nmortgage bank remains a mere decree, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nBonaparte would like to appear as the patriarchal benefactor of all\r\nclasses; but he can give to none without taking from the others. As was\r\nsaid of the Duke of Guise, at the time of the Fronde, that he was the\r\nmost obliging man in France because he had converted all his estates\r\ninto bonds upon himself for his Parisians, so would Napoleon like to be\r\nthe most obliging man in France and convert all property and all labor\r\nof France into a personal bond upon himself. He would like to steal the\r\nwhole of France to make a present thereof to France, or rather to be\r\nable to purchase France back again with French money;—as chief of the\r\n“Society of December 10,” he must purchase that which is to be his. All\r\nthe State institutions, the Senate, the Council of State, the\r\nLegislature, the Legion of Honor, the Soldiers’ decorations, the public\r\nbaths, the public buildings, the railroads, the General Staff of the\r\nNational Guard, exclusive of the rank and file, the confiscated estates\r\nof the House of Orleans,—all are converted into institutions for\r\npurchase and sale. Every place in the Army and the machinery of\r\nGovernment becomes a purchasing power. The most important thing,\r\nhowever, in this process, whereby France is taken to be given back to\r\nherself, are the percentages that, in the transfer, drop into the hands\r\nof the chief and the members of the “Society of December 10.” The\r\nwitticisms with which the Countess of L., the mistress of de Morny,\r\ncharacterized the confiscations of the Orleanist estates: “C’est le\r\npremier vol de l’aigle,” [#10 “It is the first flight of the eagle” The\r\nFrench word “vol” means theft as well as flight.] fits every fight of\r\nthe eagle that is rather a crow. He himself and his followers daily\r\ncall out to themselves, like the Italian Carthusian monk in the legend\r\ndoes to the miser, who displayfully counted the goods on which he could\r\nlive for many years to come: “Tu fai conto sopra i beni, bisogna prima\r\nfar il conto sopra gli anni.” [#11 “You count your property you should\r\nrather count the years left to you.”] In order not to make a mistake in\r\nthe years, they count by minutes. A crowd of fellows, of the best among\r\nwhom all that can be said is that one knows not whence he comes—a\r\nnoisy, restless “Boheme,” greedy after plunder, that crawls about in\r\ngallooned frocks with the same grotesque dignity as Soulonque’s [#12\r\nSoulonque was the negro Emperor of the short-lived negro Empire of\r\nHayti.] Imperial dignitaries—, thronged the court crowded the\r\nministries, and pressed upon the head of the Government and of the\r\nArmy. One can picture to himself this upper crust of the “Society of\r\nDecember 10” by considering that Veron Crevel [#13 Crevel is a\r\ncharacter of Balzac, drawn after Dr. Veron, the proprietor of the\r\n“Constitutional” newspaper, as a type of the dissolute Parisian\r\nPhilistine.] is their preacher of morality, and Granier de Cassagnac\r\ntheir thinker. When Guizot, at the time he was Minister, employed this\r\nGranier on an obscure sheet against the dynastic opposition, he used to\r\npraise him with the term: “C’est le roi des droles.” [#14 “He Is the\r\nking of the clowns.”] It were a mistake to recall the days of the\r\nRegency or of Louis XV. by the court and the kit of Louis Bonaparte’s:\r\n“Often did France have a mistress-administration, but never yet an\r\nadministration of kept men.” [#15 Madame de Girardin.]\r\n\r\nHarassed by the contradictory demands of his situation, and compelled,\r\nlike a sleight-of-hands performer, to keep, by means of constant\r\nsurprises, the eyes of the public riveted upon himself as the\r\nsubstitute of Napoleon, compelled, consequently, everyday to accomplish\r\na sort of “coup” on a small scale, Bonaparte throws the whole bourgeois\r\nsocial system into disorder; he broaches everything that seemed\r\nunbroachable by the revolution of 1848; he makes one set people patient\r\nunder the revolution and another anxious for it; he produces anarchy\r\nitself in the name of order by rubbing off from the whole machinery of\r\nGovernment the veneer of sanctity, by profaning it, by rendering it at\r\nonce nauseating and laughable. He rehearses in Paris the cult of the\r\nsacred coat of Trier with the cult of the Napoleonic Imperial mantle.\r\nBut when the Imperial Mantle shall have finally fallen upon the\r\nshoulders of Louis Bonaparte, then will also the iron statue of\r\nNapoleon drop down from the top of the Vendome column. [#16 A prophecy\r\nthat a few years later, after Bonaparte’s coronation as Emperor, was\r\nliterally fulfilled. By order of Emperor Louis Napoleon, the military\r\nstatue of the Napoleon that originally surmounted the Vendome was taken\r\ndown and replaced by one of first Napoleon in imperial robes.]"
